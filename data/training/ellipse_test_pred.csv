70E490A83717,"To begin with many students enjoy summer than winter. Making winter break longer than summer and a week off in spring and fall is not a good idea. When students come back from break regardless of the season they most likely cannot retain information, because they have been gone for a long period of time. Having a longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. Why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could help retain information?

In my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break. Even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it wont waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not help students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. Whats a break if you cannot enjoy it?

In addition what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some of the things learned, during the free time on their break. Teachers should assign online classes and review's for students to help memorize information at least once a week. That way when people return to school others wont be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. A longer winter break could possibly help the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the past in this situation.

In conclusion changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea , unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break. Overall there should not be a longer winter break than summer.

Is a option for students to learn at home,to complete their studies at anytime. I agree on this option for students. Its a opportunity for those that want to overcome their future.

It would benefit on some students, this option to attend online classes. There are some students that, they will like to attend online classes, because they have some reasons that not help them to attend to a regular school. Students that have babys have responsibilities that doesnt help them to attend to school, this people would like to attend online classes. Also people that work for their necessaries would have a chance to receive classes. In short it will be a helpful thing to receive classes, or video conference online for all this people that want to finish high school,our that want to complete their carrer, this would help them to success in their goals here is their the have a chance to attend one of this courses.

Its a helpful thing that school are offering distance learning option. There are a lot of reasons why people dont finish their high school our they carrer, for those people this will be a benefit option. Some of the people would have a opportunity to learn, to complete their schools necessaries, and archive their goals. If they didnt have a chance in the past, guess what they have a opportunity know to archieve their dream job, or dream carrer. Those people that have some circumstance to prepare to archieve there goals, this will going to make there life easier, this will work for them, is not going to be necessary to attend a regular school. In summarize it would be a tool for those that really need it, those that really want it.

In my opinion yes it is going to help a lot of people that want to learn. There can be a lot of opportunities for us, but if we dont look for it, if we dont inform our self, how we want to reach our goals, if we dont do anything to archive them, goals are not going to ring the bell of your door to find you, we have to look for them. Some people think that opportunities will go and find you, no thats not how work, we have to find them, we have to do everything to reach them,successful plans life have for us.

Practicing is important because. One example is when I learn how to play soccer. The person that teach me was my cousin Im still bad but Im learning. Another Example would be when

I learn how to bould on fornite. I learn how to bould and sauces by my cousin. Lastly when I learn how to aim on fornite. I learn because of my cousin and he teach me how. Learning a skill Is better then not to.

Being pation Is good for you for example. One time when I was trying to bould hard thing on fornite and it didn't work so i got mad. But then I tried doing net part by part and I got what I wanted.

I was waiting then got in the park and it was fun. In some cases Is better to be pation then not to.

Loaning a tik tok daced for me Is a skill. For example one dace would when I made my own dance. It was easy and I lorn. Another example would be a hard danced. I tried to duet but it was to hard so I quit. Lastly would be A danced that was hard but

I did step by step and I enjoyed. Loaning can sometimes be fun.

Practecsin is the way to success. An example would be a hard assignment that I did and it was hard. Second would be pattion when I need to.

I thing that finish high school in tree years is not a good idea because is better to have the time necessary four years is important is more time.

it is better to study more and thing what route do you want to go and take the necessary time.

for the student is help more because four years is more time then. Thant tree years and they can no be frosted for then and they can have more free time to do the personals things.

First for me be enthusiasm is ready importan. For example when I work in Chipotle I need to be enthusiasm whith the customers so the decide to come back and spend more money chipotle, in addition be enthusiasm whith the customers is nice because sometime they give me tip, and I think be enthusiasm make my job more easily because all the gruop are helping each other, because when a was new in Chipotle I was completery lost and they explain me what was my role in the job.

Next be enthusiasm in the school can help me. for example if I fail a test with 59 and my teacher see me that I am entusiasm and study hard probably my teacher give me a opportunity to retake or give me the opprtunity to do a project to increase my score for the class, if I am enthusiasm my teacher can give me extras opportunity and

I can pass the class with a good grade, and be enthusiasm can help me to have more opportunity for exaple join in sport.

Also if I am enthusiasm travel more easily, last summer my family decided go to California but I was unhappy because I was trying to visit my uncle in texas, my family see me that I was so enthusiasm that they dicided go to visit my uncle in Texas this mean be enthisiasm can guarantee a great summer.

When working online the student and teacher has obligations that he or she sould complete foor example a student that has a project due on wednesday and will do it ,on time and correct rather then the student, that goes to school and has the same project due on the same day there will be, more higher chances that the student working online will have it done first becuase the student has less time, to socalize with friends and has more time to stay foused on he's or her work .

Many kids have this advantage and it is a good one becuase they learn so much though out a online school rather then a public school ; becuase the class it more advanced and has for advantages for example the student ;online is taking pre calculas the student can easely tell the teacher what proble he or she is stuck on and the teacher can go over it explaning it in more it also help the student to be more engaging in there learning ; turo details rather then asking the teacher after class and not giving you a straight foward awnser .

Many student's taking classes online have the capibilidy and asset of graduating much earlyer becuase there classed are more advanced and with more potential to succed in life becuase of the parnts and the dissition that they have enrolled there kid in to online school ,rather then regular school .

0FA0B0078686,"Is more beneficial work as a group that work alone because:

In groups is more easy to argument more about the topic because each student on the group gives a different opinion and also diferent prespectives of the topic,and that makes the group more efficient and also the response is going to be more efficient at the time the teacher grade it.

For example: A history teacher gives his class a project, the project consist in investigate the sevent wonders of the world, and the teacher makes groups of sevent students but one student decides to make it by himself, and the tacher agree with him, the group of sevent studens divide the work in each individual that is in the group, each student pick one of the sevent wonders of the world, each individual needs to investigate all about the wonder,incluiding the location and why is one of the sevet wonders, at the end they make a power point with all the information that they found and leater they are going to present in class.

Takes less time to finish the project (or eny other type of work),because with more that one member conforming a group takes less time to finish because the work is being divided in each individual of the group.

For example: Using the previous project example for the student that pick make the work by himself takes more time for he that the time that the other groups of students take to make the project done, because he do not have eny other student to share information or divide the project work.

More easy to grade, the teacher make less time grading the projects by making groups of students, because is more easy to grade a project that sevent students make, that grade sevent projects of sevent students that make the teacher spend less time grading the projects and gives the teacher more time to teach anothers topics.

In conclution is more beneficial work as a group because more students argument and gives examples,more creativity is maded and also is more easy to the teacher to grade it. ",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,6.0,5.322070121765137,5
DD00E48BC258,"Honestly, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The pursuit of success in life is achieving it in many ways.. Therefore, you can push yourself to be successful by putting in effort.. Failure can lead to serious conflict because then you will not be able to succeed. The important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success is not agreeable because you can overcome obstacles, aiming the goal to success, and to achieve the plan to .success.

First reason, is to overcome the obstacles, for that you must have to work hard. Also, it takes practice the better you get to succeed. Do not give up on something you are overcoming in life. One of the biggest problems that people have in life is not overcoming what they are afraid of and from being afraid will not get you to succeed. Most of all to overcome the obstacles. is to try them not to give up on them.

Second reason, putting a great effort can lead to improving. Efficiently the work you do can increase a great impact towards your achievements. In order to achieve a method, working pays off and by earning it. For example, people push themselves to making progress. Others might work hard in different ways to be successful and to aim what they want. Eventually, when making progress towards something, can influence the goal your improving.

Third reason, to plan the success is to try achieving what your aiming for. In other words, enthusiasm can be those people that want to be successful in life. Pursuit also aims for the goal your trying to influence. When planning goals, is the most valuable thing to achieve. There must always be a plan towards the target you aim. Majority of the people, look for something easy they can achieve in their future goal and that is how they succeed.

Finally, the key to being successful in life is by achieving it. To be honest, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of improving. Many people find success by putting in effort and time towards big things. It is not to late to start pushing yourself to be successful and being something in life. Therefore, is it not an important role that failure plays in pursuit of success, and to achieve the plan to succeed ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.5,6.0,6.730609893798828,7

But if they keep getting C then they should not play. I think that everyone deserve to have the same treatment. I also think that they should go to tutoring and for the coach to look at the grades they have and to make sure that they are passing the class.

They only doing listing music and watch a movie so on that happen it's very disturb. Also, If the student want listen music and teacher never want to listen music so that make fight with teacher. In the class room students usually don't use cell phone so one students use every time cellphone in class he/she always trouble in class maybe that happen again and again in class the school decide and rejected him/her for didn't come to school.

Socond, students shouldn't have a cellphone in classroom because, they are doing chat when the teacher is teaching For example, When the teacher is teach on the classroom and students doing on the chat there is no attention what the teacher says. Their is no attenition to learn. Their is only play with their friends in the class .Their is show a bad image with their friends. It mean one student want to joke for other student girls or boys so he gonna show for that person bad and rude picture then student lough in bad situation. Also, the one students lough for him picture his/her moral is not good so they don't want to come again school by confidently. He/ She is scared and afraid.

Third, students shouldn't have a cellphone in classroom because, they are cheating on the test. For example, If the teacher gave for students a test and he sat down in the chair then one students have a cellphone he/she can cheat on their phone so they got a good grade for that test that makes bad for the other students score. It means students they dont have confidence do their own test. Every time they don't want to study for test and they always think doing cheat on the test but that is bad for his/her kownleage.

Fourth, students shouldn't have a cellphone in classroom because, there is no any particpate and activites when the teacher ask question for students. Their is more time waste and spend their time with their cell phone all the days. There is bad for health because when every time watch movie and listen music that is no good for brain and eyes. It means every time stay with their phone and the brain control one thing just the movie or the music so we can't handle or participate other thing even didnt look the people what their saying.

In conclusion, students shouldn't use cell phone in classroom because they are trouble in the class room and they are doing chat when the teacher is teaching.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,5.0,5.03115177154541,5
1CFAD2A1BC00,"I think that it would be good if we have a after school club because, some students might need to finish up some work there missing. Now let me tell you why it would be more good, first you get to do it in groups and make new friends in the homework club, it makes you more focus in the work that you need to and you can even do it with a group, solo, pairs. and after school homework club is perfect for all those things and it raises your grade up.

all you have to do is...

(1)Ask for your parents permission to join the homework club. (2) try and finish up the work you haven't done yet. And now your done. It even helps the school by you making the school a school where student can grow and learn. if you ask any teachers from our school they would all say that homework clubs are good to help your brain learn more and release that stress that you might have from not doing your work in time and homework club helps you in that.

45E9622CF8F7,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' Even though some people disagree, I agree with Emerson's statement. The world that we live in has always been cruel and it will always be.

Growing up in life you will see a lot of people trying to bring you down, do the wrong things and take the wrong path, it is your job to make the right decisions. For example, friends will invite you to do wrong things such as doing drugs, something you are not suppose to do, it will only get you addicted, poor, homeless or all of these combined. They will ask you if you want to try it and they will tell you that it is just for fun and that you will like it, don't listen.

You will see people trying to make you do other bad things,even worse then doing drugs, such as stealing from other people,

beating somebody up or even killing someone. Be yourself and don't listen to those type of people. Stealing, beating or killing is illegal acts and it will only get you in jail or even maybe killed.

Another reason why I

agree with Emerson's statement is because y ou should stay away from people that doesn't care about their acts,life or future. Don't try doing crazy things just to fit in because someone told you to do it, be yourself, be happy, and people will like you the way you are, they will accept you the way you are, even with all your problems.

Forget about what the world wants you to be and focus on yourself so you can be whatever you want to be. Life is too short for people to tell you how to live your life, you only get to live once, it should be your right to live right. And this is why I believe being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

When the summer break start,student can make a lot choices about their plan in the summer,for example,they can stay home,travel to somewhere,or work at some place they like;Most student's summer break have a lot different,they learn different things from their break,teacher could not really know what happen in student's break,this is why student need designed their own title.

In half way of the summer,some student might not even start making their project,in this cause if teacher give student a hard title,such as""after you read this book,what your opinion and what you learn from this book?"",then student have try rush through the book,and start making a project,it will make student have a bad project content,if student can decide they own project title,such as""base on your break,what you learn from your travel,it can be anywhere"",if student can create their own project title,it will be a lot interesting and easy.

9D0BFC12EB89,"How people can working effetely? People are working a projects, planing, or other specific works,

and those quantities is too much or hard to finish by only one person. In the school, teachers gave missions, such as portfolio or PowerPoint, and students need finish that work in limit time. Then how students can finish their works easier and earlier? Basically, group working is more effective than working alone because when you working with group, you can share works, and you can teach and learn each others.

The reason of benefits of group working is you can divide your works with your teammates. Some works' quantities is too much to receive you alone. But if you working with other people, they'll receive some of your works. For example, scientific experiment in science class can be cited good example at here. In this example, you can see that group working is effective than working alone. When students take experiment in science class, they can share their position. Someone undertakes to write experiment reports, others get ready the materials, etc, students are take their own position and share the works. Therefore they can save the time and finish works early. Thus, working with group is nice choice.

Also other reason is people can learn from each other. Sometimes People working, they may have something that they don't know. But if they are group working, teammates can teach what they don't know between each others and those of them can learn from someone such as specialist and expert. For example, Afterschool study club can be cited good example. In this example, you can see that students are helping each others and learn from teacher. As like this, people can help and learn when they working with group. Therefore, group is more beneficial than alone.

Some people argue that working alone is better than group working because it can develop and grow up itself. Anyway, people had growing to refuse problems and find answers by themselves. For example, SAT study is one of example. In this example, you can see the students are studying their own way. If students keep try to study themselves without other helps, they can find they own answers and build up study plan. When student solve the hard questions, check answers, fix and review wrong questions, they'll grow up effectively. However, they have some problems that really hard to solve themselves. But if they working with friends or other people, they can know how find the answers of problems.

In conclusion, working with other people is better than work only self. When people working with others, they can save time and learn what they don't know effectively than working alone. All in all, try to work with your mates.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,6.0,6.2631516456604,6

6E3ED4DB9512,Some people think that failing is bad i think otherwas. Failure is good that's how you know that you are leraning from your mistak. If you do not fail you will not succed in life in anything. I have fail so many time but that's how i get better in whatever i'm doing and how i do it. I agree with what winston to have success you most leran to be successful. leran about whatever you want and see how other people do it and why. Take everthing step by step till you got it. For instean to leran how to ride a bike you will need to know everything about that bike and how it works. You will have traing wheels then take one side and balest. Do it with the other side later on when you get better you will not need them at all. Now with no traing wheels its gets easyer as you keep riding and knowing the bike. To get where you want to be you have to fail even then you think you got it. Something will always be there getting in your way from succesing. The most succesful people had to fail over and over again to be where they are now. From thoses mistaks you will know what to do and not do when and where too. Like me i want to work on cars and to get better i have to get a car i do not care about and leran from it. How what part dose what and how it works with the car. Taking the engine out is not easy but i can do it. From taking all the fluilds out if the car unplug the batery so no check engine light comes on. Everthing is step by step miss a step and it will not so well for you later now. I remaber not knowing how to take something off the car so i had to look it up in my phone. What to do what size i need and how everything comes off. To have succes leran form your mistakes it wil not be easy but you can do it at the end. Other people think success will just come out of luck when you need it. It dose not work that way at all for somepeople maybe but for others not. That is way i think failure is good for the success later on to come. Fall and fail will make you better to succes in life and get where you want to go. No dream is small is you but your heart and soal on to it you will make it. To have a bisnes you have to fail from failing your bissenis will grow and make you more money on the long run. Failure is not a bad thing you just have to leran from it get better and keep going. Do not let failure stop you from gettin where you want to be and make that money. ,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,5.0,5.258821964263916,5
1F41E6E6CE4D,"Imagine if, you only have to go to the school four days per week. There is a debate about should school system implement the model four-day work week, by adding two hours to the school time each day in order to conserve the natural resources. Some people think it is not the correct way to give a solution to the problem since, it is not going to make a relevant change in the amount of resources that we will save. I believe that implementing this model is a great idea because we conserve resources, we have 3 days off, and we have more time to homework.

First, we conserve resources. Since, taking off one day of school; at the end of the year, we would safe a significant amount of water. Furthermore, Have you ever think about the amount of energy we use just on one day of school, taking off one day will save an innumerable amount of energy over time. The last one but not less important, everyday in each school is eaten tons of food, taking off one day of school, we would save food. Implementing this model of four-day school work we would save energy an resources, as a result, we would save money.

In addition, the students would have 3 days off. Some students have to work after school so, having one more day off the students could get some rest, as a result, better grades. The student could spend the additional day off to hang out with friends because of, a lot of students do not have the time over the weekend to share with friends due by different responsibilities they have. Giving the students one extra day off the could get less stress, due by the different things students do, they feel that do not have enough time by their on, as a result, at the end of the weekend they are so tired and spiritless to do the something.

Finally, there would be more time to the students to do homework. Adding one day off to the school schedule, could give to the students quite enough time to get ahead with the school stuff. Sometimes, students expressing that there are circumstances where they can not turn in their stuff on time, due by they do not have time. Some says that there are moments when they have accrued a bunch of different homework from different subjetcs beause of they do not have the time to do it.

In conclusion, implementing the model four-day work week, on the schools is such as a great idea because we conserve resources, we have 3 days off, and there would be more time to do homework. There is not a dark side of having one more day off. Follow this model will give us a chance to think about the changes that we have to make in order to have a conscient society of what is happening around us.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,8.0,6.5447893142700195,7
8A17C63FBFCB,"The British and politician John Lubbock wrote that are character will be what you yourself choose to I think that are character trait are influence beyond are control. Because are character trait are influence by are parent, society and peers around us.

First, I think that are character traits are influence by are parent because are parent tell us what do, parent always tell us the good and the bad in are life and always want the best for us in school and out of school. They will also make sure that we are doing good and school will help us make the right decision and are life and to never give up in her life they will encourage you to keep trying more hard so you can rich and accomplish your goal you have in the future and to be someone you want.

Second, are character traits are influence by are society because the society surround us, tell us what happening around the world and they will always be their to help you and what you need and to make you feel you are important to them in their life. They will also make sure that you move forward in your life and tell you that you are good person around them society help you move around the world help you have good experience in your life.

Third, are character trait are influence by are peers because are peers tell us to do the bad thing we are not so post to do, peers influence you by going the wrong direction in your life and they also take you to make the bad thing that you have never done. They will tell you to do what they want you to do peers can also make your feeling bad and take you were they go make you go with them in do the bad decision in life peers will not help you in life they will make you go the wrong way instead of the right way.

In conclusion, John Lubbock wrote that are character will be what you yourself choose to this character trait can influence you by your parent, society and peers around us. This character that John Lubbock wrote is that your character is be what you want to be but I think that are character trait formed by influence beyond our control because we are influence and control by are parent, society and peers around the world.

People choose theire own character because, they know that theire choice will make them win at the end. When it comes to choosing, it might be as hard as a stone at the begining because, we are not sure if it is going to work or not. But nothing comes in an easy way if you want the reall succesful ,we need to follow our character.

Whenever we choose our own character, we have the confidence to do on what we are planing to do. And when we have the confidence, it is way easier to manage any case that comes to our life. We do not choose our charater whitout knowing ourself, and that is why it is better to choose our character by knowing what is best for ourself. For exampe: Sometimes in life we get so many bad things on our way, but if we choose to take it easy on them by choosing our best character, that helps a lot because it is making our life easier in an easy way without much stressing.

As long as we know our charachter, we will always have the right chocie to make, because we know what is going to match with our character or with our wantings. Sometimes when we are planing to get married, we do not just guess to match with our parteners ,but we choose our character to match with our partner's character, that is because we know that we can choose our character in any how that makes us feel the best way to our living. Or sometimes you can fall in love but you partener might have a better character then you, so you decide to change your character by choosing your partener's character, and that is why we should choose our own character.

A lot of people choose thier character when they start school, because they see a lot of diffrent characters in school and they start noticing which character belongs to them. Or they can learn from what thier teacher teaches them, and we all know that our teachers are always willing to teach us the best behaviour and that is why the most students start to choose thiere character at school.

When we choose the character that we want, it helps us to find the right people in our life, because we are more happy when we find people that are the same as our character without changing our character.

5D693DD9978D,"How will be high school different if you will graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years? Three years things happen very fast than four years. you can't learn a lot things that happen in high school in three year because you will follow different plan for to graduate early. It is not a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college because I have to force my work, I will be indecisive and I won't be able to take elective course. All this will be hared days for me to finish my high school in three years.

Firstly, if I want to graduate in three years I have to force my work because I must have to take courses during the summers or in the evenings. And I do not wanna do that because normally my family every summer go to visit different country. Also I have to take course course during the evenings where I go to play soccer because I like to play. For example, if I want to graduate early I could not do this and I am to young to force my life, I have time to take this things slow because when I force my work I feel like my work will be wrong and I could not learn anything and that can not help me to go to the college. So three years is to short to learn everything that we have to learn in high school. It is not a good idea to force your work because like you did to learn things from the high school is how you will forget it.

Also, finish your high school in three years do not let you to think about what you want to study for the college because your course will be to short and you won't to do a good decision. If you have a lot time you can think better and you can find a new goal. For example, when i was in eleven grade i did not what i want to study when i will go to the college. But now i am taking geometry and i like it. Now like to be architect because i found that math is one of my favorite class. If i just took three years of high school i did not what want to do for college. So three years is to short to take decision for go to the college, you can go but as a indecisive student.

Finally, high school in three years will be boring for me without course elective because there two courses electives that i like. One of them is art and band those became me a good students, they change my life. For example, when i play the violin in my class with my classmate that moment, i forget everything that was wrong in my life. Another example is art where i can draw my happiness and i can remember that the life is not wrong. So i prefer to study four year and take my course elective than to study three years whiteout enjoy my high school with my course elective. it is a not a good idea to students to study three years of high school because they won't find the taste of high school.

Some people think that work force, indecisive person and won't be able to take course elective is better because they want to graduate early. They do not care about their life, they just want to do this to do that and they do not learn anything. However, to go the college you need to be more prepare because college is different than high school. That is why must of the college is hard to enter because some educational programs offer that allow high school student to graduate in three years and then when they go to college they do not anything. Because in three years is not enough for a high school students.",2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,5.0,6.055415153503418,6

In conclusion ,online courses don't replace a school environment but, it helps the student to go faster during the school year . It helps them to reach another classes successfully . Students during that learning are the leaders of their time and how they are managing they way they learn every lesson of the course.

Not going to school it will effect students communication skills. It will not led students communication skill to growth up beacuse they will not have to many people around them.

Some students will be more hard to learn taking classes from home becuase it will not be a teacher to teach them when they have a questions. some students are more face contact to be able to learn more easily. If you go to school your friend in class can explain you something that you didn't understand but, taking classes at home you don't have nobody to ask for help.

Students can be even asking for help to others teachers. Their are some students that English is not their first language and for thrm it will be more hard taking clases from home.

86FF8C846E87,"In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter to high school.

Do you think it is a good idea fro students to commit to a career at a young age? I believe students should not have to identify a career by the time they enter to high school. Most of the students might need more extra time to think about what they want to be in the future, what career will be the best one for them and they will learn others careers while they are in high school.

First, students might have to be in high school before they chose they career or what they want to be in the future. Most of the students by the time that they enter to high school wont know what career to take, so they might need more extra time in high school to learn more others about others career. In four years that they will be in high school, students will be old they will know all about career and what career they will like to have in their future.

Second, Most of the students will like to have learn other new things about others type of carrier that they dont know while they are in high school. while students are in high school (10 grade) most of the students will have ideas about what the career that they chose is about. it is important to be at least 17 years old that way students are more old and know what they are doing, another things that is to make sure you are taking the career that you really want and ask you parents for their opinion. Some students that enter to high school they say i want to be that when they someone but they are not sure.

Third, Is not a good idea for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, some students wont know what carrier is or others types of carrier. Most of the students might need help from someone who is old than them to give them some counsel from their parents or the person who take care of them and have the responsibility of them. They might have to be in high school so they can choose the class that they need for the carrier that they think is the best for them.

In conclusion, i believe students dont have to identify a career by the time they enter high school because some students might want to learn new things about others carrier that they dont know or they will chose a carrier while they are in 8 grade, when they get to 9 grade they might get to know other types of carriers and they might try to change they carrier but is going to be late because they already chose all the classes that they need for the career.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,6.0,6.185466766357422,6

CE7E3C75BAF8,"This statement says that ""first impressions are almost impossible to change."" I disagree with this statement because it is possible to change anyone impressions. Like if they are having a bad day and someone walks up to that person and does something to make them feel a little better. They can also do that to other people by making new friends and making their day better. By getting positive with them they would feel a little bit happier around you and people.

It can impact on how that person day changes from bad to good. Knowing that is helps that person out a lot by having a good mood now. It can change other people mood as well. They can share the positively to other people making sure that they feel alright. By doing that they can share with there family as well.

Getting other people happy will make you even more happy by how you were showing other people. It doesn't have to be random people it can be your boyfriend/girlfriend. By doing that you can meet a lot of new people in life that can make you happy. It can bless you by other things in the world. Other people can make you feel better by sitting next to you if your alone and talk.

By showing being happy they could be friends and get well with each other. Also if they are gonna be friends they can show each other positive mood if they are feeling down. Having those types of friends would be nice to have around with you that make you laugh and smile. The attitude that they give you could change as well by how they talk to you. If they talk to you aggressive then it would change your mood.

287CAE92D7EB,"I agree because your first impressions to a person or something should be you. Whatever you do and say will stay stuck to whoever you meet with for the first time. If you're going for an interview your first impression be soemthing that the person that interviewd you should never forget. You shouldn't go out there in the world and not show an impression that nobody is going to remember.

Let's say that you met this one person, and she loved your first impression the first time you guys met. She wants to meet up again and hangout. The next time you guys meet up and hangout. She feels a different type of vibe. That is why you should always be yourself towards everything. Because that is how you will make a goof bond with someone and will always remember there first impresssion.

There was trhis one time i really liked this girl, and we talked for a while. One day we just made it official and started going out. She was amazing but one time i really messed up. We were planniing to end it before this all happened. She had to go to college and we eneded. But the last night we hung out, I saw a girl earlier that day. I didn't want to tell her because i was a little punk. The next day we decided to end things. A few months passed and i texted her ""imy'. And i told her that i needed to tell her something. So i told her what i did; she wasn't very happy. She wrote me a whole paragragh, which i expected. And blocked me on every social media platform, which i expected. Then a few months passed and I texted her that if we could meet up somewhere and talk. She said 'ok'. The next day i picked her up at her house, it was really awkward. We went to Generic_City, got ice cream and talked for a while. But her vibe wasn't there anymore like how it used to be. Her first impression was different. She lookeed like a whole new person. She told me that she's been hooking up with alot of guys since we broke up. That's when i got up and left her at Generic_City. Till this day i haven't talked to her or seen her.

First impressions can never be changed no matter what. Once you show yourslef its done. They will almost remember what kind of person you're. Your first impression must be you and being polite. Make them remember you. Make them want to see you again and multiple times. You can't dissapoint. Iv'e seen people not get a job or a girl just because of there first impression. You must come with energy and ready to be yourself.

This one time, my bestrfriend really liked this girl. And i told him to go make a move and make a good impression that she will never forget. When he went up to her, he got so nervous that he got stuck and the girl just walked away because she felt weird. But i wasn't surprised because he was never good at talking to girls. I had to help my boy out so i told him that to just be himself and make a good impression. He doesn't have to be shy, he doesn't have anything to lose. Except maybe the girl. But i told him to just think positive. The next day he saw walking past and i told him that it's time. All this training, all this hard wokr. The time has come, my bestfreind did it.

B198316DAA03,"Failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success because failure is a guide to success , failure and having success is about learning from the mistakes you have done everyone is not granted success at birth, to master something or have success in life you must have failed multiple times before you have master your objective. there are many way thats show how important failure such as trial and error, learning from mistakes, and past experiences.

Firstly without failure there wont be a way to determine if the event was successful or not. In this quote former British prime minister Winston church chill once said that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. in the quote Prime Minister Winston Churchill shows the importance the role that plays in the pursuit of success. Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill quote and stamens are very accurate and show young kill how to fail and have success.

Secondly failure is a part of life and everything will always have some kind of failure. with out failure there would not be a way to determine success in an event. sports would not be as fun if there was no failure there would be no way of getting better no point in practicing to learn from our mistake. success is going from failure to failure it plays in the pursuit of success.

Thirdly another reason that failure plays an important role in the path to success is because failures are something that aids the learning process. when a kid is learning how to skateboard or ride a bicycle they are not going to be successful at first there going to have to learn how to ride it. when a little kid is learning how to ride a bike or a sake board they are bound to fall the first times. the kids are going to have to fail before they are successful and learn how to ride.

Failure is apart of life. In order to success come failure, and with failure comes success, no one was born successful in life. failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success because failure is a guide to success , failure and having success is about learning from the mistakes you have done, everyone is not granted success at birth, to master something or have success in life you must have failed multiple times before you have master your objective.

B1E1608C016D,"'Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.''-Churchill once said this phrase during WW2 to tell his people that it didn't matter how many battles Britain was going to lose but that they were going to win the war. Personally I do agree with Prime Minister Churchill many times on my life I have fail, and fail again but I got up because I knew that there was a good price at the end. Humans now at days think that life is all about planing the future, and they all just trying to avoid problems, trying to live only winning but to reach success there must be a long journey of lost battles, of big problems but you must stay put because it does not matter how many times you fall you most get up again, and again.

My Dad once told me ''Always try never give up''. Back in 2014 it was my first day on the soccer academy

I been playing soccer as a defender all my life but this time it was my first time training in such a good team I started training every day make some friends too. A few days later the first game came I was not on starting line up or on the bench I wasn't even call for the game I was upset but I though that it was because I was new in the team, or the coach didn't know me well. The next day during practice my coach call me out and told me if you wanted a spot on the team you need to work harder after that day I knew I needed to start training more, going to the gym more often, and I start eating more healthy a few days later during practice I started seeing results I was getting stronger, faster, and skillful a few weeks later I got called for the teams fourth game but I was not in starting eleven I was sitting on the bench the all game I was upset I though I was failure once more but I never gave up and the next day I was back practice, eating more healthy, going to they gym more often. Halfway during the season one of the the starting defenders left the team and I knew it was my chance I started and I play all the game and I didn't just prove my coach that capable more importantly I prove my self. Later during the season in one of the last games in one play I dislocated my arm and that meant that I was out for the rest of the season. After three long months of recovery after was heal I started once again training harder, eating healthy, going to the gym more often getting ready for the next season. beginning of 2015 that season I was chosen as team captain and I played all the games all that hard work was worthy at the end.

It dosen't matter how many times I failed I never lose my enthusiasm because in life we are going to have many failures and we will feel life given up but we most get up and keep going it doesn't matter how many times we lose a battle our main goal must be win the war because just like Churchill failed again, and again but at the end he won the war with his people I also failed in my team again, and again but I won my own war at the end.

24BBFA26D076,"In the new modern technology world, many people use technology as a superior tool that will help us in our everyday life. I agree with the limitation of human contact to the use of technology has a positive effect on people's lives. This is because many people use technology to find a lot of resourceful information, to learn about the world and to learn new things that will be helpful in the future. Also, technology gives students and adults good resourceful information to study, to create projects and to learn about any topic.

First of all, many people use technology to find a lot of resourceful information to learn about the world and to learn new things that will be helpful in the future. In many cases many people have a hard time understanding what teachers try to teach so they decide to look it up and learn more about the topic. The technology we use now in day is way more modern because there is more information we can use to become better learners. For example, as a students that speaks two languages most of the times I would misunderstand words and I would look them up to know what it is and it's meaning. I also try to look for many topic that will help me with projects or homework to have good grades and become a better student. The internet bring many resourceful information that will help anyone at anytime with projects, homework, work, or any other event.

Secondly, technology gives students and adults good resourceful information to study, to create projects and to learn about any topic. for example, many adults and students used to go to the library to find good information about a class or work project and it would be difficult at some point for students who lived far away from libraries. The students that have to drive or even take a bus just to go to the library have waste time to come and go. In other words, the internet bring great resourceful information that can be easy access at home even by a smart phone device. The smart devices bring apps to find incredible information and you can even find very interesting articles that will also help you. In other words, many people have to find new ways to have a good information by there side, as many adults like to read news articles they can easily access to online news of any kind. The internet is a very fascinating place where we can find many things like, recipes, news, information to learn about the world.

On the other hand, many people disagree with the idea of technology limitation and they have a negative effect on the topic because they think that to much technology can eventually damage your brain and your eyes. This fact is not true because many people find technology very fascinating it has created many thing in life and we are surrounded by those good ideas. Also, many parents think students or other people can lose sight from being on a smart device too much. This fact is not true because a rest for the ayes can be done to have a normal sight again. Many people who think it's a negative impact is because they aren't very familiar with the new technology and most of the time they don't know that everything that is around them is build mostly because of technology. In my opinion, technology is a great place to start ether because your stuck on something or you don't know anything about the topic. The new generation of people is surrounded by new ideas and technology is the biggest resource we have to learn from ideas come from the internet for us to learn from them.

In conclusion, technology is a great limitation of human contact to the use of technology has a positive effect on people's lives. Technology brings out many ideas that can also develop other new ones and will be helpful for new information to answer questions in the future.

In addition, some students like to work in group because they share the work in different pieces. For example in my country when i was at school the teacher make different group in my group was 5 students. The teacher gave a math projects. The projects was call the 5 combination each students have to result one combination.

However, some students like to take different position like when they are doing draw or different homework. For example , when I work in group in take my position when the teacher tell me because sometime the teacher tell you when you have to draw or read sometime.

In addition, some students have different ideas like work in group of 4 or 5 it is depend how much work it is. In my opinion, i like to work in 5 because we conclude more ideas. More ideas you have much better it is for the group to works .For example , I was thinking in one idea and my partner have other one and we put together to help the group.

In conclusion, Students work in group to collect more ideas . They are more benefits to work in group because they can have more essay time more people have in group more better it is .",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,4.947032928466797,5
ABAC4A93E9C0,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes online or video conferences. Do I think students would benefit this more? Yes I do believe that this can be something that these Young Kids growing on becoming what they wanna be as adults. Do I think they would possibly enjoy this more for maybe personal reasons or making more time for other things that might be important to you as well.

Some kids that want to start working early to start saving up getting your own things, not having to worry about other people trying to get you stuff. But maybe helping family with money and things at home that they probably would want you to do for them. also putting school in mind because you might need to buy certain things for school that you might really need to get for yourself to help your learning online. Doing things on your very own for yourself and for family. caring for what truly matters.

Another reason on doing this is maybe doing things with family more, out of school activities that you might be doing Like sports. If you ever have a trip to some where with a family member or a friend. maybe take your materials and computer and do it whenever. Wherever you go and got time to get back to it when you're ready.

If not then maybe just do all the work when your back on doing whatever just dont forget about getting work done for school maybe email them too letting them know your having a trip or whatever is happening at that moment of time. You might play a sport and have a team that you love playing with outside of school and you make more time on playing with them. Wouldnt mind learning and working during the night maybe?, During the day. whenever is easiest and best for you.

Realized that there is different types of kids and people in the world where they would like to work alone and be where they prefer is better for them to work. Some kids say that being in crowds make them feel uncomfortable in some sorta way, it doesnt make them feel like they wanna be there for personal reasons that they possibly gone through in life. So thats why kids sometimes leave and go some where else that the staff wouldnt like during lunch or wherever during the day. Then the kids get in trouble for not wanting to be some where that they dont wanna be at.

So I think kids that feel this way during school in some certain classes or the whole day of school. Maybe you can have the opportunity to work your classes online instead of in school. Doing things that is possibly best for you on improving yourself in life and learning to getting your education could be a good choice for you if you dont like dealing with certain things that you agree and understand for people that want to do this too.

You should allow students to brings cell phones to school because you never know what could happened to them. Because something could happened to them or to someone else after school and there's no way to contact for help. And so like if there ride ain't coming after school they could call them to let them know.

Another reason why they should bring their phones to school is so they could have there own time like during lunch. Because during lunch is when they get to talk so why just not let them use their phone. And so they could know about everything and no be in class looking through their phones trying to know what's going on. and like if the teacher gives them free time that will be a good time to let them check their phones. And let them use them before school like in breakfast. And if they get caught using it during class they should get a warning next time.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,6.0,5.418622016906738,5
F9FEE5DC1640,"Imagination and knowledge are all come from you mine, but what are the different between those two? Scientist Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I'm agree with him, because if you take a class like art or computer graphs, you don't really need your knowledge, the most important thing you need, is your imagination. It can help you do better in the class.

first, the different between Imagination and knowledge is you don't need to rember the knowledge, and sometimes people have hard time to remberm. So you just need to think you like to do, and you don't need to follow the knowledge what you learn. I'm that kind of person that don't like to rember things, but I like to do what in my mine want to do. We have a lot knowledge need to learn, and we never finished learning, but we can use our imagination to do more things that is helpful to the world.

I guess, everybody like to play video games, but do you know how they make the games up? I did create app club this fall, first I thought we will create some app what other people already create it before, but than the teacher told us that, everybody will be create in they are own app, I don't know what kind of app I want to create, and told the teacher said, ""can I create a one somebody just create it before?"" ""No, you can't, you need to be imagination, just think of what you want to do, and what kind of app you like."" She answer. the end of the due day, I use my imagination to create a game app. From this class I learn that imagination is more important than knowledge.

Imagination and knowledge are both important, but imagination is a little better than knowledge, we can use our imagination to do more helpful things to our beautiful world. In our life we have too much knowledge need to learn, we need to keep learning and nerve stop.  ",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,6.0,5.543184757232666,6

Example:Our life will be better if the experts guidance the people, because they know what is the best way you have to take, and they can help you if you are rong in something.

Is very important work in group with experts, because they have many experience in many thing, and they can help you to understand more than you believe, and this is my idea why is important that the people have to be guidance for the expert people and who have more experience, and i believe that work in group is better than alone.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,5.0,4.770980358123779,5

One of the reasons that I would like to be selected is because that can help me to find the right job and to know how to do it ,and to learn about it more, Because I can have more experience on doing my job. For example if I have to do one thing I should know how to do it and is better to learn something before doing it.

Another reason is because not all schools have partnerships with companies to visit and learn about the work that interest students, that way I know what's the work that interests me by having that type of help on schools, By doing that type of help students learn new things and have more opportunity in life and have better jobs and have more money by doing the type of jobs that they want to have in there future is a great help for schools to have that. Students should already know what they want to learn about work.

I think that is a great help for schools to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment, so student learn more and they can find a job that they want that is why I want to be selected and visit and learn.

CA46274B46ED,"Some educators feel that most of the students enjoy summer vacation because is a long break vacation. Also they feel that because the break is too long the students do not retain any information that they have learned during the year so they do not remember anything when they return to school in the fall. Some people argue that the summer vacation should be shorter than it is. They say that it could be from 3 to 4 weeks last and have a longer winter break instead. I will take a position in this issue by saying if I agree with the people or not. I will support my opinion by providing some reasons and examples.

First, educators are totally right by saying that students do not retain any information that they have learned during the school year when they are on their summer vacation. Students are out of school therefore, they are not interested in taking a book and read it or doing some writing just to remind themselves what they have learned at school. They feel totally free from school, from doing homework, from having to study for tests. I think students deserve a long summer break, after being working so hard at school during the hole year. Students can have time for themselves, like hangingout with their friends, go the movies and maybe travel into another countries. I think summer vacation is the right time to do that.

Secondly, students are not going to be able to remember anything from what they have learned because that is a lot for what students have been through during the school year but I think they can review some imformation at the beginning of the year to refresh their memories. Students just want to have a long break for their brains. Some students love going to the beach or to the pool so, summer season is the perfect time to do it. Students cannot even think how terrible it would be for them if for some reason someone decides to change their long summer break to a short summer break. Students get prepared when summer season is beginning, they start to make plans of what they are going to do during the break. Students get exited when winter is almost over.

Thirdly, students enjoy more when it is summer season because they can do a lot of activities out. Some students prefer summer season vacation so they can get a part job and do some other things during the day. For example, some students like to do some sports. Students love that summer break is so long so they can enjoy it without being worried that it will last so little. Also, students prefer summer break to travel either here in the country to a different state or maybe going into a different country. In some cases there are so many students that like to go to visit their families, friends or just because they want to know some other places. Literally, I think students will never change their long summer break for anything. They love summer break and mostly because is a long break. It will be so weird for them to change it to a short summer break or to a long winter break.

However, some people might argue that it will be a good idea to have a short summer break so students could retain a little bit of information of what they have learned when they go back to school, I disagree with that opinion because of all the reasons and examples I have listed above.

In conclusion, all students deserve and should have a long summer break because they need to have their own time to rest, to travel, and to do as many activities as they like to do when it is summer season and because they have been working so hard during the school year.",4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.056167602539062,8
0EBED6896F51,"Would you choose to fail for somebody else's ideas and not your own?

Although some say that people should seek guidance from people that have experience about life because they have become more wise with the years, actually people should make their own decisions because you already know what you want for your life and if you fail will be for your own decision and not on somebody else.

Some say that people should seek guidance from experts that have experience about life because they have become wise with the years. Old people like my grandfather for example, he always told me that the best way to accomplish something you really want is by giving the best of us and not wait for other people to do it for you because that is not going to happen.

In reality people should make their own decisions about what to do with their lives because you already have an idea about how you really want to be or what you want for your life to be in the future. When my brother was about to finish high school he tried to get an advice from somebody about what to do with his life, but my father was always working and my mom had not experience about life because she had taken some bad decisions in life. So my brother had to follow his instincts and take a decision in his own. Now he graduated from high school and he started an academy to be a police officer one day.

Some people say that it is better to fail by taking our own decisions and not fail because of decisions that other people take for us. I still remember my aunt Generic_Name she always wanted to be a cloth designer but she did not take her own decision and now she is still working and making some more money then a cloth designer, but she is not completely happy with her job because she followed some other people ideas and she did not think on what she really wanted for her life.

In conclusion it is better to follow your ideas because that way we will do what we really want for our lives and not what other people tell you to do even if they haven more experience sometimes is just better to follow your instincts. Seek guidance from experts that have a lot of experience about life is not always the best thing to do because if you follow their ideas you will not work on what you want.

This is a program that benefits a lot of children around the world that for different circumstances they can't attend to a school building. But what happens when a child has the physical and mental capacity to attend school but still decides to have home school, are they going to have the same benefits as the rest of students that attend to school?

Every child has the right to be educated. There exists plenty of qualities and values that a student can develop in a classroom such as: honesty, friendship, respect, leadership, etc. These are just some of all the attributes a student can gain by attending to school, but one of the most important qualities that a human can learn is the interaction with others. This is because the world is based on that, every single day people interact with other people and learn form each other, this is the way the world works.

In school, students have to interact with their classmates and teachers day by day. There are group assignments were teachers put you in a group were nobody knows each other so they can work together and hopefully build a good friendship. Sports in school are also a great way to interact with others, teachers encourage students to participate in sport activities after school. If the student doesn't like sports there also are different clubs in school in which students can participate.

In conclusion the home school program can teach all the knowledge a student needs such as sciences or maths but, it doesnt teach the values and attributes a human needs.

D57EBE64C7A2,"I am agree with students to use their cell phone in the classroom because some students came to the United State with not knowing any words in English, and even of a student that born in the United State or their native language is English can get to forget the meaning of a word in English. For instance, cellphones or another type of device.

And it can drive you to many type of option which is very good! if you are not clear in the first option you can jump to the second option or third option if needed.

Some students came to the United State without speaking English which mean is so bad, and they don't know how to communicate with teachers so they are likely to uses their cellphone for translating words. I was one of the student that came to United State without speaking any English, and teachers can't speak Spanish too, so I was able to use my phone for translate words to my language, it was helping a lot to communicate with other students that only speaks English. In another reason, I daily uses my phone because it is easy to carrying It in the hallway instead of a big dictionary, and some dictionary does not contain the word that you looking for . Beyond of that, in the cellphone you just need to download the dictionary app or go the Google web and type easily the word that you need to fine information for.

Therefore, cellphones can give many way to you how to understand the word specially the Google web site it can give you pictures, or it can led you to a video link where you can see resources that are explaining the meaning of the word or different manner that they can be clear at the point. I use Google a lot of time because has everything that the dictionary can not be included for example, Google translate can tell you the pronunciation, quickly to research, and even if it is bad it will tell you the meaning besides that if you don't know how to spell the word it contains an option where you can talk to the cellphone which is a lovely option to use.

However, cellphones is a almighty thing to be used in the classroom to help students knowledge or everywhere. beside, been smart and having powerful resource we can learn from cellphones to do many things as some teachers want us to use our cellphones for Wikipedia, kahhot , dictionary web, and googlecassroom for reading , writing or gave us homework throw it.

As we can know already cellphone is very useful for this options too. calling ,sending message, receiving message , set remainder, multiple resource, ects.

First of all is entertain because you are not thinking about wrong things that you may get stressed . You are playing or doing something else it entertain by making you be happy all the time . I think entertain is something that everyone has in their life . Entertain is like if you are not doing something you will get bored , but if you do something you will be entertain . For example in team when you practice you are entertained at that time . If you know someone that is bored came and talk to that person and tell him or she a story about something make feel that person that there is someone who knows what is entertain in this life .

Secondly is have fun because you are happy when you are doing it , for example when you are playing soccer and you are winning you are happy because you are winning . Talk to others because if you don't do anything to talk to them you will not have fun that day . Make new friends so that you can tell them how your life is going . Have fun by doing things that you like . Help others when they needed .

Always think that you have to be happy all the time not yes because of you also for others .

Finally is learn because when you are on a team of soccer or something else you learn how to talk in group , search ideas or working in a team during that game by communicating with others , for example when you have the ball in the game and you don't know to who pass the ball there is where someone have to talk and communicate with others so that they can have the ball and go up and make the goal that's called working in group to make everything much better . Work hard so that you can feel how enjoyable is doing something right . Learn is something important in your life because it will help you in your future , learn how to be respectful with you couch or team is important .

Activities are enjoyable because everything can help you to relax every time that you needed . For example

When

5EE6F7530113,"Character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. Many older people take advantage of the youth by influencing them poorly. Being a bad influence towards the youth can lead to an unexpected future. Therefor being a bad influence can influence others to do wrong. Many people believe character traits are chosen by the person themselves because people want to be their own person.

Many older try to take advantage of the fact that the youth can easily be influenced. Older people can influence the youth by feeding them wrong information about the people around them. Being a bad influence can impact another personal life by messing with their head. Not only will the influence mess up their personal life but also mess up their social life. That is why the youth should stay away from strangers.

Being a bad influence can lead to an unexpected future because the youth wont know what theyre capable of. Kids who are surrounded by bad influences can grow up to be much worse because they were taught to do bad. Bad influences can lead to going to jail or death because as the kids get older they'll be charged as an adult for the bad that they did. As the youth keeps getting influenced by the the bad older people the world will become a much worse place and people will start to feel unsafe. As the youth grows with the bad influences trust will become an issue because all these people have done wrong and is still doing it. Slowly the world will start to fall apart because too many bad things are going around and nothing will be able to balance it.

Many people believe character traits are chosen by the people themselves. People just want to be them and do their own thing. Character traits mainly depend on how someone looks at things differently. It is very good to have your own traits because people can see how the person really acts. More people will like the person if they are themselves and not try to be someone else.

Character traits are controlled by the influence a person had while they were growing up. Older people try to take advantage of the youth by teaching them wrong things.

C4F7250F4A45,"Cell Phones

Dear TEACHER_NAME;

why should cell phones not be used? I strongly agree cell phones should be use at any time. They might have personal problems and need their phones out. They might also have a personal problem or need to fly out of the state right away because of personal problems.

To begin with, what if the students are in science or math class and need the calculator for them to work out a problem, what if they have personal problems and need to have their phone on or there just in case. I think students should also be able to use any other electronics on their free time.

Let me explain further, students should be able to use cell phones in case of emergencies only, not to talk on the phone with other students",3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,6.0,7.412043571472168,7
5384378F1AC2,"The great question here is, should schools allow students to use cell phones for educational purposes or should cell phones be prohibited in the classroom? In my opinion, schools should use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Some school staff members may claim that cell phones should be forbidden in the classroom even for eductional purposes. Because, they think students will lose their attentions. However, I firmly believe that shools should allow students to use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes.

Students will be effective academically as long as they use cell phones in the classroom. There are several reasons for my opinion. My first reason is that as a student, whenever I use cell phones in the classroom, I can search things easily and take pictures when nedded if my teachers allow me; which will help me on my studying when I go home. Another reason for my opinion is, if I don't have my phone with me, I will be eager until the bell rings and get my phone back without concentrating on the class. For example, I have a friend whose father took her cell phone forcing here to study the whole school year. Stubbornly, she stops doing what he tells her to do. Instead, she persistently hang-out and have more fun. As a result, she got F's for all of her classes. Therefore, using cell phones in the classroom helps the learning-teaching process.

Using cell phones in the classroom helps to call if something happens in the class. For instance, if a stranger comes with a gun or if a lock-down happens and I hear the stranger's voice, I will call 911 for help. Secondly, if an emergency occurs like fire, hurricane, and a huge lightneing while I am in the class, I may need to call to my family to let them know how I am doing. In that case, they will know about my situation. To sum up, most people like doing things which are forbidden for them. Students may hide and use their phones for another purpose eventhough they are not allowed to use it in the classroom; which is more riskier than using in front of the teachers. Consequently, the positive effect of using cell phones in the classroom is more influential.

In conclusion, schools should use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Other people say that cell phones should not be used in schools during class periods. I obstinately argue that phones should be used in the classroom for the purpose of education since the positive effect is more influential and using cell phones is more quicker than using laptops or other electronic devices.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,8.0,7.980296611785889,8

Example is not the mine thing in influencing others; it is the only thing because,thats the only way others will figure out what you talking about examples is what everyone use to help each other to also understand each other however,others say that example is not the mine thing to influencing other because, there are many other things to influence others for example, Google translator,Google,YouTube there is a lot of other apps that help to influence others.

i agree that Example is not the mine thing in influencing others; it is the only thing because , example is used every where and most of the time even when you want to speak to someone with another language and also kids see adult people as an example too them they see what they do and copy them example is used with everything for ex, for parents if they want there kid to be good they got to be an example of them or they have to show them an example of something or someone how to be behavior is one of the most important things because it show others hot to act and it it gives other people example of how to act in a sernat place for ex,if a kid go to a library and see tow adult being loud and playing around he going to do the same because he think that they doing the right thing because they are adult and should know how to act in place like that .

If i go to school from 7:30 AM to 2:20 PM and then go home for a little and having another classes in the evenings. My mind can not take that much. Because you need to focus to pass the classes. And if you do not pass the class you are not graduating.

Taking classes in the summer, it dose not work for everyone some people like to take life easy. And not doing every thing fast. Because your mid needs a rest too. If you go to your class and not do anything or not foucus life will be hard for you. If you take classes in the summer and you don't pass them. That would be wast of your time.

Some people dont have money want to work during the summer to save money for collage. Because not every one is living a good life. Not every one will have the money to go to collage ride a way when they finish high school. A lot of people need to work before they go to college.

Not being able to take elective classes it actually sucks. Some people taking classes in high school that it will help them in their life. Also people take classes that it will help them get ready for collage. In high school if you don't take elective classes you propply get bored. If you go in all your classes and you do work. your mind need to get some rest.

First, the student have more freedom of concentrate in the home that school because student not have noisy peoples, student work more quickly and have interests in the class. The corporation a student of regular school and home student, in the regular school have lass time in the class and home have more time and focus in the class.

But they don't want to sit in class with a bunch of nerds that paint, make clay and draw. Students should not be required to take a class they don't like. It should be optional just like band class. Some students might fail the class because they either don't like being there and just skip the class or they're not that good at making clay or drawing. For drama it should be optional too since all you do is make an act and speech and it has nothing to do in students futures. Music class is what students will find most interesting but it has nothing to do with students futures either.

* I can not have contact with my friends.

that i need to know.

* I can not have time of read any book.

* If i not know any word, i can find in the

* I can loss my friends.

diccionary of the internet.

* I don't want to play with other person.

* I can not have communication with my friends or also with my family.

Although some say that used technology are positive because you can find more things that you need to know actually, people say that use technology is negative because you don't have contact with you fiends or other person and you don't have time to read any book.

Use technology is positive for the people because when i have to make any homework i can find more fast things that i need to know, and this help me to have a good grade, because when a don't know something i need to look for information that help me to understand and make a good class work, and i think that the more easy form use technology is when i used things like: computer or phone. Also when i don't understand a word i can search in the dictionary to the internet, because is more easy and. Also i think that technology is important because can help me to have communication with my family. For example: I born in Generic_City and i have two brothers, and a come to United States with my mom 3 years ago, and my brothers stay in Generic_City, the unique form that my brothers my mom and me feel that we are close to them, is about technology, because if the technology not exist my mom and me can not had communication with my brothers and my family.

For other part, i think that use technology are negative, because for example: when i come to the school, i don't need to use my phone, because is a distraction for me, and this can cause me problems with my teacher, because when i use my phone i don't pay attention in class. Also the most important thing is that i can start to loss my friends because they can think that i don't like spend time with they, and also that they are not important for me, because my time is used technology. And maybe i can start to have limitation with my family, because i spend my time in things that are not important. And this is so bad, because when i don't have communication with my friends they can find another person that really are a good friend. Also i think that some times use technology in excess is so bad, because i can not have time to make tings that i really like, maybe i don't want to play any more with my friends or read some books.

I know some people that every like use technology in applicatios like: Facebook, whatssap or another more. I think that the reality is that use technology every day is a really loss of time, because don't have time to make some more importants tings.

I remember when i come to this school, my first year i passed the majority of the time using my phone because in this time the technology become in something so important for me, because i did not have friends, but with the pass of the time, i find some good friends, and now i spend more time with my family and friends, and i use my phone only when is necessary.

For this reasons i think that use technology have good and bad thigs.                                                                                          ",3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,6.0,5.291041851043701,5
52D0FED6AF38,"Many people debate about this topic since one of the most known scientist said this statement. A lot of people agree and disagree, and from my knowledge, I agree. Imagination is something that everyone has, not everyone has knowledge. Imagination can lead you to imagine things that other people haven't. This is how many scientist got fame by just thinking about new things.

With imagination you can think about a new type of computers, new math formula, or a new type of material that hasn't been invented yet. Many scientist invented new stuff from just thinking about new formulas or experiments that they could to make something new. There's also things like the periodic table, that the scientist who made it spent days and nights just thinking about new substances and materials, when he went to sleep, he dreamed about new substances that later on got on the periodic table.

Thinking about things in places you shouldn't, like school, could either lead you success and give new things to do and study, or low grades because you weren't paying attention, must of the times is the second option. Thinking is most of the times in math, where you have to do a hard equation and think and do a lot of work. If you like to think, that might be your favorite class and you will get good grades. Getting good grades in math is really good, it means that you have a good memory and you can easily learn new things (it usually means that when you can do a lot of problems without having difficulty).

Imaginations can also give you knowledge, when you think, it opens a new whole world of ideas. You can basically do anything you want. You can basically experiment with anything you want, but you might not get the right answer or the thing you expected but you will also learn why. These type of things can also help you to learn why something did or did not work as planned. It also helps you think about stuff that you could or not do in real life, for example doing something that is ilegal and you shouldn't do. It also helps when you think a rule or a law is dumb, you can thing what could happen if you did it, that could work to see why it's a rule.

Imagination is something that everyone has and everyone can use without a limit. Using it can lead to a lot of stuff, such as success and making new things. Knowledge is something not everyone has and not everyone can use, imagining can lead you to learn new stuff without doing much effort or risking to do it in real life and might get in trouble by doing it.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,7.0,7.265974044799805,7

D325C8F858F6,"A group of students have skill to take decisions, there're a lot way to do, students can react to any problem, but work alone can be good as a group, people who like work alone have abilities: reasoning, recognize, and expression. Groups were created to share ideas. Therefore, it's not bad get help from other people, everyone say, "" two head think better than one.""

Groups make different way to share or send a message, a few people can create a lot, base in their share of thoughts, abilities, and decisions. Groups have the most of attention in this case. Elsewhere, work alone is base in just you, and what you know, if something that you did it, come to be wrong, you will not share it. If people who like work by their self can't support ideas with reasoning, can't do a perfect project. the change of ideas always will be a good work and the can support your reasons, why you had make it.

Work in group include: less work, time, and money, back to work alone you have your own words, spend a lot of your time more than you think, also could take too much time to finish. To different of groups students can do other activities. The group help to students to learn and combine new thought from other students. Friends can help to get a correct answer or do a good work.

The important of groups is that students learn to share, help, and be kind with other students make a friend, besides that learn, help, and teach to other, they make fun their work. work alone give stress and that show someone who want to make everything by his\herself they share their own ideas. Sometimes work alone can be a good choice, because is you're wrong, you can't blame to nobody.

In conclusion, I believe that groups are more helpful for students, because they learn to take other decision and compare. About work alone, I'm not agree, because you try to do something, maybe that's good, but you're not count with other ideas, expressions, or declaration of other thought. In my opinion is more beneficial working in groups that show us compare, analyze, and be friendly with others.",2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,5.0,5.402040481567383,5

They need to step up and do something different.

Adults and kids should participate in educational enjoyable activities.

They will have a chance to do someting different.

Sharing brilliant ideas and challenge eachother.

Doing something everyone will like and have fun.

Kids should participate in school plays and other afterschool activity.

Playing in a play will make kids confident.

It will help them express their confidence front of the crowd.

Kids will have interest in doing something other than watching television.

People who don't wanna act out in a play they can work backstage helping making costumes and writing scripts.

There will be some ""not so good days""

because not everyone is going to be happy and want to do what they were assingned, but at the end of the day something good will come.

Doing something different in someones regular routine will make an intrest

Sharing ideas and teamwork.

People can make up plays and in order to do that they need to make up ideas and brainstorm.

Script writers, people who are acting and the backstage crew can help make up a play.

This part can educational because everyone is coming up with ideas they are also thinking in a constructive way: in order make the play intresting the writers need to add creativity,

mystery and also make it dramatic so the audience have interest in the play.

Sharing ideas will bring everyone's thinking in one and that makes teamwork

Competing each other.

Some plays have a competiton they compete based on who has the best acting and stratergy.

This will make the people who are participating work hard.

They would want to work hard because obviosly they want to win.

Even if they didn't win they will know they had to work hard and pay attention.

Sometimes people can't talk front of a crowd because they might be nervous what they are going to say, and that's okay because participating in plays will increase the rate of confidence by looking at the crowd and talking in front of them.

If someone played in a play and their acting again,

they won't feel scared or nervous because they already went in front of a crowd.

Only hard workers makes the win not those who don't even try.

Participiating in plays will be an educational enjoyable activity.

I believe doing something fun and constructive will change your structure in life.

Adults and kids should participate in enjoyable activities.

They will have a chance to do something. Share brilliant ideas and go in a competition.

57E8161AEF27,"I think It's a really good idea, And students they will benefit with this idea, Bacuse they don't have to travel to school eveyday, it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing because is soo much easier. And i think is more beneficial beacuse i dont think, Students would want to travel eveyday to school and back.

I think students they will benefit with this idea, because they are not going to spend that much money, In traveling to school eveyday. It will be so much easier taking classes only, because students will have more free time to do their own things, after they're done with all their schoolo work at home: for example; if the students works it will be a better option of taking classes only because he/she will have more time in getting ready for work, and been on time to work.

Reasons why I say it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing, It's because students they don't have to worry, about gettig in trauble for been late to school, Because if students will travel to school schoool, there will be a high posibility of not getting to school on time sometimes it can be for many reasons; for example: traffict issus, parents they might get sick or any other reason, It will be really hard for this students if schools wouldn't offer away to study and learn at home, schools they make it easier for this students who aren't able to come to school, Myself as student i think this is a really good idea made by the school, Bacuse it gives students the oportnity of study at home when they aren't caplable to show up to school for this type of reasons.

I am agree with schools that offers distance learning as an option for the students, Because some students don't have the ability as others students, That has the oportunity of riding the bus to school everyday from Monday to Friday, This students who takes online classes is because they really need it, And they don't have a way of getting to school eveyday , It might be more difficult for them , because they might not have someone to explain them as well as a teacher. Another reason why i think some students students take only classes is because some classes that they like, some school don't have them, and they really want to know about it, Aslo sometimes parents look trought schools to see the classes option they have online so they can apply to see if their sons can takes those classes online to learn about it. One of the major reason why student take classes online sometimes is because they don't have enaught credits, so they have to take classes online, Becuase even if they come to school they won't be able to graduate because they dont have all the credits needed, Some students don't live near the schools to come all the way to school so they decide to take the classes at home.",2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,5.0,5.234511375427246,5
A263E403FAC3,"it's a gtood idea for us the students, like that we could know what we want to study when we be graduated from the high school. we have a lot of time to think about it. I would like to study for pilot, so i can try to choose one class to be related about that and learn about how to drive an airplane.

But, Not all the schools has these benefits and also because some students don't have how to go to these schools and all of us students do not can go to any high school. I think that's the only bad thing because if you drive, you just can go and then back your home and some times if someone is giving to you ride is good as well but it's not gonna be every time then you would have to find who can take you to school and who can pick you up from the school.

Well I think we the student to commit to a career at a young age is well because we can be graduated more early.

the good news is if you go to thats schools you can learn more and choose what do you wanna study for college thats a good point and also you may have a lot of opportunities, In some high schools you needed have good grade for going there and passing clases too.

in others words if you don't have a good grades you can't sign for that schools.

77D210B9EC7E,"Students will benefit from being able to do the classes from home because maybe they have reason to do there or having some problems because some people doesn't like the community or having to many people around them. If I have a choice to choose one of them i think i will choice to go to school to know more people.

These are my three reasons on how students can do the online classes from their home.

The first reason is why students want to do the online classes from their home, because maybe they don't like the people from outside probably they think that all people are bad, they are not nice, mean, in respectful. Probably their parents doesn't want because they scared of how people are going to treat them or they are going to give them a bad influence like going in the wrong life. Or they don't want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are going to laugh at them.

The second reason is maybe other students don't like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not gonna like them or judging them sometime students don't want to go because maybe they have a medical problems because they feel embarresed or something bad happened when they were at school.

Finally if I choose one of them like staying at home or going to school i will choice to go to school because I will love to help people to explain them that why is important to go to school and giving a advice to them that they don't need to be embarresed if they have problems they just need yo let it go some people don't think if he or she are hurting the person who is bullying them.

In conclusion is that if people choose the online classes and doing at their home they are free to choose because they equal are going to study but at their home they have reason to do there. But i will say that people don't need to care what other people is saying to them.",3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,7.0,5.4416375160217285,5
0FC61E073762,"Life it's like rolercoster we fall sometimes but we need to get back up. I agree with Prime Minister Winston Churchill life is all ups and downs we need to go through stuff sometimes so then we can actually talk from our own experiences. Life is all about learning from our mistakes, we become a better person and we get some real life experiences. Now ill introduction to my first reason.

Learning from our mistakes is my first reason. I have so many friends the lean on other people's problems, they have never gone through a hard time, a time the they learned something about how to deal with life. This people only lives with other people's life experiences. I think having a little hard time in life is actually something good. it makes you a great person, you learn how to take care of yourself, you don't see life the same way the you used too and lot of things change.

We become a better person is my second reason. Me being just a teenager i had gone through some fallen for example;trying out for cheers,trying out for soccer at the end of the day I learned to I wasn't really good at soccer and the I really didn't even like the sport I also find out I'm not the girly to actually be smiling every second or act super pretty and all the time, I actually found something I really like I started playing rugby, I started taking

JROTC at my school I stared to find the real me I knew the I wasnt the regular teenager and I knew there was and still something special in me now I thanks the coaches for all this teams the said no to me because now I'm doing something I really love and it makes me feel so good and proud about myself.

Life experiences is my last reason. this reason was hard to talk about after I didn't get select for soccer or cheers I got sad and I couldnt believed the I didnt get in. One day I told myself""sometimes stuff happen for a reason"" I think it was the best advice I gave to myself I though it would be hard to explain to people how come I didnt make the team or why I wasnt good at stuff. I told so many people the I quit last minute but it wans't true,me knowing I was saying stuff the it wants true was killing me on the inside I dont like to lie so I started saying the truth and it felt so good, yes people stop talking to me but also other people came in my life and forgive me from what I said.

in conclusion life sometimes is all about having fun,loving yourself, learn from mistakes get back up trust people around you and ask foe help. I think learning how to get back up by yourself is hard we always need friends in life and falling down sometimes can actually help us to get off this clone of we are all good great type of person.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,5.0,6.028434753417969,6

E1EC4869981F,"The decision that the principal made that students should get involved in the activities is an unethical idea. Who would like to waste their time doing something that is not really beneficial? At school students have a lot of works to do, and now being in another activity might have a bad affect in their academic goals.

If a student get involved with the activities they wont have time for there daily work. They will have less time to do their homework or projects. This can keep students away from their academic goals. They also wont have much time to spend with family. which means that there will be problems with those relationships, and there will be separations between there family.

Getting involved in these activities brings stress for students. There will be one extra program added in their daily routine, Which contains more work. The work that they didnt choose to do, but the have to do. By having stress after this much work students wont get enough sleep, Which is an unhealthy situation.

Having this much pressure can affect students's grades. By spending their time on something that they dont really want to do, but they have to can put them in a lot of pressure which keeps them away from what they want to do. They will join these activities and wont focus on their studies. Students will start getting bad grades.

So, after this many reasons we all know that getting involved in the extracurricular activities can really hurt students. Joining these activities is neither healthy nor good for grades.

8E40E03B113A,"Many people I known included teachers and Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. They said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I believe this statement would be true, in many case and many situation, these words bring different meaning, different thought, different understanding for me.

In 2018 nowadays, when i look around to admire all the things that people made to make the earth better. Technology, car, house, ... People who invent those things had to go through thousand of failure to get to this success. Thomas Edison was one of the scientist dedicated his inventor for the world, after so many times fail to search for right element, finally he can bring light for everyone. The more failure we have, the more success we get. He does not see failure is failure, it is just one step to get closer success. Technology we use nowadays is one of a example for success. After every year, we keep produce new model, it is not because the last model is fail. Because we want to upgrade it, because we heading to future, to successful.

I just move to America around one year ago, and I realized that they created the fear non failure environment. From education to jobs, we all have a chance to fail to be better, failure is just a opening of success. That is why retake is so important to student. One of my favorite failure is in first time take History class here, I thought it would be easy until I just get thirteen point eight percent on my grade book. And I start working with it, research and talk to my teacher. After short period time of training myself, before I check my grade, teacher come to me and said ""Do you know how much you get for the test ?"" I shake my head and ask him ""is it bad ?"" he said no and walk away with a smile. I get 100 percent, and that feeling is so amazing for me. I can not get that feeling without failing, failure make success important, valued. So if we keep success all the time then success will be meaningless. In my opinion, go from hundred to hundred percent is not as good as thirteen point eight to hundred percent. My country is much difference, everyone know everyone's grade. So student just compare them self to other and also bring a lot of failure negative feeling for other student. But in this environment, grade is secure and teacher just want us to be smarter than them so failure is not a matter, failure become not so fearful and not so embarrassing.

There are also people do not agree with this statement in different situation. Every time we fail, failure bring us experience and painful, but sometimes we received only painful with little experience. In the case that we just can do somethings once in a hole life and if we fail it, chance will not get back to us to do a second times. How painful it is cause when failure go up, price of success go up, painful go up, experiment go up and enthusiasm go down. So sometimes they want to stay away from that, stay away from failure. Or in the case of criminal crime, he want to rob a bank and he fail, he went to jail and then when he come out, he know that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. His enthusiasm, however, is so strong that he dare to rob a bank again, and he fail again and again. This statement go different direction for different view of people.

In the conclusion, Winston Churchill was right. Every time we fail we learn somethings new and one step closer to success. But that success is just truly success with people who are helping other, make the world better.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,6.0,5.716245174407959,6
9B5E878ED861,"Everyone would like to receive praise for their work, even if the work is not their best effort, that will make them not to think low of themselves and just give up. In my opinion, true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives an individual determination, and self confidence.

Although, some people believe that self-esteem comes from an achievement because it gives self-discipline; for instance, a student did a poor job on a classroom test , that means he is not receiving any praise and didn't achieve anything, but because of that he will be self-discipline, so he would do a good job next time and receive an achievement.

I think true self-esteem come from praise because it gives an individual determination. For example, if a student gets a non pleasant grade in class, and the teacher praises the student but also tell him to do better next time, that would give the student hope and determination to do better next time.

In addition, true self-esteem comes from self-confidence. For instance, I am in a soccer club, but every time we practice I don't do better because I don't have the confidence, but instead of the coach cutting me off the team, he came up to me and told me that I can do better. He praised me and courage me to do better. That is going me to build self-confident in me and I would start doing better during practice.

According to my reason and examples stated above, I think true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives a student determination and help build self-confidence in a student. To all the teachers, please praise a student work and let the student feel like the can do more and better.      ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,6.0,6.882802963256836,7

78EA0C3715FE,"In most cases student are committed to a career at a young age by school or their parents to guide them early. This could be a benefit for them, since they are young and have the capacity to learn faster, also if they are in high school it would be good for them to be guided at a young age to help them on a career they would like to take, and when they go to college,they don't find the stuff they are going to see complicated, and they are somewhat prepare and have an idea of what they are going to learn if they choose to go to college.

I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because it helps students prepare their mentality, knowledge, and give them an idea of what they are going to see, and focus on the career they want to choose. Most of the time students do not want to commit to a career at a young age because they are either so stressed out from school and they feel like they cannot decide what career they want to take or because they feel like it is not really going to help them much on what they choose. Some students don't know or can't decide what career they want to take, and that is not okay because they most know by the time they are at least in 11th grade, so school can give them the appropriate classes to prepare them for that career, and those classes to help them when they go to college. In fact, not going prepare to college it can be complicated to students and probably stressful since they have no idea what so ever of what they are going to see or learn. For example, when you know what career you want to take since the beginning of high school and you are focus on that career, and you take the classes that will help you be prepare for that career, when you go to college you have an idea, and you are not going to be as stress as other students who didn't want to take advantage of that.

I would personally take the chance so I can be prepared for college, I think if I take classes that will help me be prepared it would obviously be good for me. I already know what career I want to take and the classes that are recommended for that specific career, and it is actually good because I can learn more about that career, I know that I am capable for the career I want and that it will not be hard for me since I always liked what I want to do which is about computers, and technology related. My parents also recommend me to commit to my career at young age so I can learn and practice my skills. Some students don't have the support of their parents like I do and they just decide to finish high school and be done which is not really good if they want to get a job that will give them a lot of money, and most of the jobs requires you to have a degree of some sort or specific for that job.

There are jobs that don't ask for anything just the high school diploma, but those jobs don't really pay that much, and they are kind of heavy, not all of them but most of them. Some jobs like construction, and plumber don't require that you need to have a college degree just the high school diploma, and this jobs also pay really good, but they are really tiring and heavy, mostly construction that you have to be outside in that hot temperature or cold. If you compare this jobs with like a being a doctor, dentists, or technician; this jobs requires you to have a college degree, and you have to go to college for either 2,3,4 or 5 years so you can get the degree of any of this careers, and they pay you a lot and it is not heavy and you don't expose yourself to hot or cold temperatures, and that is a benefit for you if you want to have a really sotf or calm job.

Basically if you know what career you want to take, and you prepare yourself like taking all your classes, and what you need, you should be good for the most part. Not all the time going to college to get a degree so you can get a job is the only way to get money or make a living out of it. For example, you can be a singer, and if your music is loved by most of the people you can success and make money out of it by selling albums or promoting your songs to different platform in internet. Playing sports like soccer, basketball, tennis, or baseball can give you a chance to make money, for example, you can have a career out of that, but you most good for big teams to pick you up and pay you which payment is a lot if you make it to the big teams.

This doesn't always work for everyone only for the talented ones that were meant to be good at each of the careers. For example, I like to play soccer, but I am not good enough to make a career out of it, so I decided to finish my studies, follow my career, and get the job that I would like. Some students finish high school and then they decide to do this type of careers which sometimes work for few of them, they reached their goals and sometimes they don't even finish high school, but if they can't accomplish this, then they have all they need which is their diploma or they can continue with their studies to get the job they would like to have.

In conclusion, is a good thing that students commit to a career early so they can be prepared for the future this will also help them develop their capacity when they go to college where things will get a little bit hard for them. Most of the students do this and they success in their careers, I would to the same because I know high school will help me get prepare for college, and I don't have to feel the pressure of not knowing anything all, I already have a little bit of understanding and knowledge.",4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,8.0,7.579663276672363,8

We depend on technology everyday, we live with it. Technology is changing, evolving even, but are we? I mean, we put our lives in technology though the internet comparing ourselves with one and the other. No wonder so many of us are depressed, they see what other people have but to blind to see what they have is important. Everyone sees the same thing but have a different perspective.

Time wasting is a big one. Peoples eyes are glued to there own personal screen. Sheeple. They care about the new, the best, the bad, and the ugly. They only care about themselves and there phones and shirts with a red bar that says supreme in white text.

I agree with Emerson's statement, because I think that the world every day will still change and people also will still change their life, their goals and their future for something better, So this make you that be yourself can be too hard for you and everyone's else.

I believe that to be myself is something special for me, but i think that to be different to other that make me more special, i mean it doesnt matter how people want to see you or how they saw you, its how you want to look like, if you want to do something for your life, something that you think its gonna be better for you future just do it.

C95AC12FA0D0,"Back in the old days, there were no opportunities for students to explore certain occupations to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment. Now days, it made a huge difference students had big opportunities to explore certain occupations. Dear Manger, I believe that I and every other student should have an opportunity to explore occupations because, It helps me and the students determine what we want to job we will work in the future, have an experience in different types of jobs, and it is eligible for a country to develop.

To start with, every student has a dream job that they want to accomplish when they grow up. Having an opportunity to discover want they want to do in the future is very essential. For example: A high school student decided to finish his career and go collage and have a job after graduation, But that student does not know what is the best fit for her/him. By giving an opportunity for that student to explore types of jobs will help her/him find the best fit job, and it will reduce the stress and depression. For my experience, some students and friends in my school are complaining about depression, it was caused by over-thinking about their future and jobs. I believe if we had an opportunity to discover in what we are interested in will help me and all others to reduce stress.

In Addition, Having an experience means having knowledge. It is a honor to have an experience in all types of occupations. It is very essential in the United States that you have an experience before you apply for a job. Since we are students and we had an that opportunity for all those experience I strongly believe that we can find the best career for us and it won't be intense when we move to the next level. Back in the old days a friend of mine is a graduated collage student from Medical School she applied in a hospital as a surgeon, the manger needed an experience of Art skills, but she never had an opportunity to have that kind of experience. It ruined her decisions and made all things complicated, and she could not get that job, she was too late.

Finally, Developing our country is all in our hands. Dear Manager, if we had this big opportunity we will work one developing our country. Most of the students will be persistent about there jobs if they find there best fit, they will work with love and kindness, and will influence the next generation too. For Example: A student who was his dream to be a designer, that student started to work hard he made the best kind of clothes, everybody liked it and made everyone feels happy, and he became the most famous designer in the world just, because he found what is the best job for him.

Some Company Managers thinks that it is not essential for students to have partnership with their companies, but i totally disagree, First, it will determine the future jobs, second, having an experience, and lastly it influences others and develops country.

In Conclusion, we can see how the United States is developed since the students had opportunities to explore their occupations. A huge difference came those years, as I said students back in the old days did not have the opportunity and has very hard to accomplish their dreams. and I believe if all companies opens partnership with schools will help us gain experince, develope and influnce others, and will lead in a bright future for students.

34DA35A20049,"What do you think do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? In my essay im going to talk about how we can accomplish a lot of things if were always doing something. One of points that im going to talk about is being in a group and how you can accomplish a lot of things if you do it right. Another point that im going to talk about is how you can accomplish more being athletes. The last point that im going to talk about is do we accomplish more if were always doing something.

The first point im going to talk about is being in a group. Being in a group you can accomplish more because you have people around you that can help you and that are always working. You can also assign each other to a specific topic so you can get the work done quicker. You can also help each other out if someone doesnt understand the topic. Being in a group is efficient because you always have someone doing there part and thats why you accomplish more. Although being in a group helps you can accomplish more you can also accomplish more being athletes.

Another point that i have is how you can accomplish more being athletes. Being athletes your always doing something and your also trying to become one of the best. Being athletes can be hard at times because of the hate so your always trying to accomplish more by working hard because if they dont work hard you might not accomplish your goals . For example College football athletes there goal is to make the NFL so there always trying to accomplish more by working hard and always asks for advice from there peers to see what they can improve on.

Although you can accomplish more being athletes you can also accomplish more if your always doing something.

The last point I have is do we accomplish more if were always doing something.

The answer is yes because when your working hard to accomplish something it can happen, for example you can get the job that you always wanted that you couldnt get before. If you give it your hardest you can accomplish what ever you want because you know you can do it. However you cant always accomplish more when your doing something because sometimes you either give up or you dont have the energy to do it.

What do you think do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose?

In my essay I talked about how we can accomplish a lot of things if were always doing something. The points that i talked about were being in a group and how you can accomplish a lot of things.

I dont think students are going to do there summer project if is something boring. If student do something there interesting on they are going to do research and finish there project on time because went summer hits not many student are interesting on doing work. I think that is going to be fun doing something i like and not something the teacher wants us to do.

If student do a summer project about just studient animals look for there behavior, some student mite think is fun. They would be some student that is going to be boring or they won't go out as much and not see animals at all. I think student should just pick the topic they think is going to be fun for them and they are going to enjoy reaching about whatever they want to learn. Teacher can grade something interesting not some boring work they tell us to do. i think even the teacher can have fun reading all the thing we come up with in the summer is just going to be fun for student and teachers.

I think teacher would be even happier if student do something they are going to get the benefits of it maybe a student wants to learn about how to treat a open cut or how to save the world from pollution. That would be something interesting that a student can learn about and who knows it mite come in handy and same the world from pollution and treat open cuts because your mom or friends got a dip cut in the house or in school.

The school lunch should to be healthier for student to eat. Otherwise many students will not go to their class or lunch because they skip class to go buy food. Many students at my school argue that the food should change. And others student say the food should stay the same because they like it and it healthier for them. For example one day at my school students got into agreement saying that they are happy with the school menus that they have those why many students do not skip classes. Other students may not like the idea of changing because they think the new change will worst then they have.

If schools change to healthier food for students many student will be in the class to learn and stop thinking about skiing class to go buy food. For example one of my classmate always goes out to from school during class to buy food and i ask him why he said the school food are not good enough for him and those the problem he skip class to go to buy food. changing school food will be good idea and also bad because same students want same food they have now day but other want change and those where all arguing start. The good way to make students happy about is to keep the one they most like and get ruined of the one they do not like.

Some may argue that changing school menu would be bad idea because the new menu would be something that the students may not like do or not healthier for them. Other people think that many students get sick when they eat school food and many students are not learning and they do not go to classes in time or they skip same periods. In my idea i think changing school menu would be good idea because the menus that school provides are not healthier and same of them are not good for our bodies. The best way to provides healthy food for student is change the menu that most students heat.

To summarize, the main reason to change school menus is there are many students agree with the idea and there same who disagree about changing the school menu. I think good way to solve this problem is they have to keep the menu they already have and students like to eat most. And change for those who agree with the idea.

2986E2782AA3,"There is no doubt that school should control the involvement of the students in extracurricular activities; because the school are the ones who know the students if they are doing great or struggling in their academics study. However, there are many students that really pursuing to get involve in many kinds of activities in order to have an appreciation to other people even they are struggling in their study. In fact, having many kind of activities is fun and you can make new friends on it but, having many kinds of activities it also leads you to not having time in study, to not doing their homework assignments and also they are losing interest on their subjects. School should only allow the students to get involve to one activity in order help them manage their time for their study.

A reason that school should control the involvement of the students in the extracurricular activities is that some students they do not have time to their study because they are involve in many activities. Once a student involve in many activities they become less interest in study; because they are having fun in those activities. For instance, I have a friend who is a high school student who struggle in his study because he is involve in many activities such as: sports, music, and drama. To all his activities that he's involve with I believe that it require a lot of time for practice instead time for study it becomes the time for his practice. There was one time the that I ask my self that ""which should I go to the practice or to the group study?"" of course I picked the group study because i know my priorities.

Another reason that school should control the involvement of the students in the extracurricular activities is that some students are not doing their homework assignments; because they are involve in activities. When the students come home from school they already exhausted due to the practice. For example, my cousin is a varsity player in basketball, as I notice when he comes home he directly went to his room,and when

I checked him he is already sleep, he did not even eat his food because he is too tired. In the morning, when he woke up he went to my room and ask for help for his assignment. He should have been done when he work it at night.

The last reason that school should control the involvement in the extracurricular activities is that some students are losing their interest in their subjects because they are involve in many activities. They are having fun in those activities and they lose their interest in academics. School should control them that teach them to make the study their priority before the other. Based in my experience, having many kind of extracurricular activities is not easy, but it is fun, you can make new friends. However, you could actually lose interest in subject because you are always thinking about it, you are not focused anymore.

For all the reasons above, it shows that school should really control the involvement of the students in extracurricular activities especially to the students who are really trying to get involve in many activities. School should not just let the student do what they want. The school should help the student to manage their schedule and time .The student should also cooperate with the school because it is for their own good. It depends also in the students if they really know what are their priorities.         ",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.086331844329834,6

E83BE2C46D0D,"In some schools they have a program that pairs older student with younger student. The older student are available to assist the younger student in order to succeed on their goal. ""Aww man, I **** hate this, I don't know how to make this spaghetti and meatball sandwich I had the wheat bread, the sauce, manssreala cheese, spaghetti and my meatballs what else in this world am I missing. Did you know that 50% of the population of older student have often fail because of lack of communication and the other half is lack of knowledge. I believed, If older student help the younger kids they will they both will succeed in different things. For example, communicating more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on.

Learning to communicate more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on. I learn my mistake because one of the older student name Generic_Name, help me with a problem involving math and science. Generic_Name love math and would love to help me, their were a lot of steps I need to do it was only five minutes when he was done, but it felt like an eternal. I understand why I was wrong and what I need to do in order to get it right. From my point of view I knew he was having trouble communicating with me because he was studding a lot and made mistakes. We both learn a lesson that nobody is perfect the first time. I love the quote that Leon Missie said at the convention. He said ""Nobody Is Perfect The First Time, and remember that everyone has a talent or skill."" That means everyone has made a mistake more than once and try to fix it."" I remember the time I did a terrible mistake, I was in a chemistry class In Generic_School I was doing in a experiment, I had to put on my safety first. I over did with the salt a little bit. In a dangerous chemical called La Muete, which means that it is poisonous, so the becker exploded in to a million pieces and all I saw was fire on my cloth and on the teacher desk .The teacher quickly got the fire extinguisher and put it on me first and then the fire form letting spread more and boy I got my **** kick by my mom and dad so hard that they made me pay for all the damage I created. So my teacher got me an assist too help me with the calculation so I don't mess up again. Eventually, I pass the class with a B-, I was relief that it was over and I won't do that chemical bond ever again.""

Often successes can help both young and older student. Sometimes the older student can make a mistake too and teach the younger student. That it is okay if you made a mistake, but make sure that you don't know something don't leave it blank just try and figure out what missing because the assist won't be there all ways. Life dosen't work like that, their are thing that we have to figure out on our own. My job is teach you what the problem that your stuck on and me learning how to communicate with others and you learning your problems, and trying to fix them.""I remember when I got my license at the age 21 and yes that means I crash a lot, turning in the wrong direction, and even broken into people yards. Yes, it really hard driving and I had this final attempt that if I don't pass then I don't ever get my license even when I really old. So I study hard and where i'm I supposed to go, stop when the light is red, Break when something is moving in the road, read the speed limit, park in a specific position ,and most importantly turn on the signal. I had an assist or should I say my friend Generic_Name, was with me and telling me what to do. I thought I was going to crash in to someones yard again but not this time, I was driving pretty go actually .So the day had come and I need to relaxed and not think about failing, and them my family will laugh at me for not passing, and I had to live with my parents all the time just because I can't drive. I stared to do go and the instructor showing me where to turn. After a few hours had passed I barely had passed with a C- and that not to go and not to bad. I had my license and my life was going go too.

To sum it all up, all over the world school have a program called ""Two is better than One"" it a program that allows older student assist the younger student in order for them to succeed in the conflicts there having trouble on It helps both old and younger students. It helps the older student to communicate more with people and so on and so forth. When the older student learn how to communicate with others they with eventually learn to help or talk to strangers more often. Failure can eventually lead to successes, like my driving license, I fail lots of times but that never stop me from getting my driving license. From that chemistry class that I almost took the whole school down with me. From that final attempt I learn that no matter how many time you fall there will always be a way to succeed. But there will be time were you need someone assist so they can help you. Did you have a difficult time on something and ask someone to help you or fail at a test and the teacher have you an assist in order for you to pass it again?

D743AC1EB08D,"how conserve energy and resources

The energy, and the resources are the most important factors in the world, for the evolution and survival of the human. There are many types of resources such as money, products, and energy power. Factors that have supported the human life for long time, and actually continue it happening. Every body in this world must be career it, because these resources are helping us to survive ,and support our life style. But the sad-reality is that the human does not career it, because they do not know about the consequences or they are ignorant. We need to rectify our mistake, and keep safe our resources. This written will be about advice, benefits, disadvantages, and plans how career our resource.

Let talk about the benefits that we are go to get if we safe our resources. First, there is a plan or recommendation what is about adopt a four-day work week, with each days 10 hours work, and school days with two hours. This is as a way to save our resources, and obtain the following benefits; we are going to save the energy, food,internet, water, time (to spend in our life with the family or whatever we want), the deterioration of our clothes and shoes. We are going to help the environment to keep it safe from the pollution, to make a better style life for the humans, and save resources for critical moments in the world. As you can see there are many resources what we could save, if we have adopt this plan.

In this plan, there are many benefits but also disadvantages. For this time I am go to talk about the disadvantages, if we implement this project. There will be present many problem such as the loss of time to learn, time to work, we will lost our social life in the school as in the work, became a professional will be harder and tardy. The technology advance will be slower, and it is go to affect the human evolution. Then we will lose many important things, and resources. Factors that could support in life, and make it easier.

In conclusion, There will be many people whom will benefit from this project , but at same time it is go to make many problems cause the disadvantages. If we implement this plan, we must be able to understand, we are go to take our risk. Moreover we must be think about the risky that this could be, and prevent more problems than we already have. I recommended do not waste our time anymore, starting to create a better world with a better life style, and creating new project to save resources. This support or this type of project need to be created by the government, because they are whom have the power to control whole country. Now take career our resource became a new goals for me after reflect a topic as this. We are going to understand that is necessary protect our resources, because they are indispensable to keep us alive and keep going with this life what we have in the twenty-one century.

6FBD476D8AC9,"If in the city i live there is a debating between the adoption of a 10 P.M weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers, my opinion would be that it will better if nobody adopts it. In my opinion teenager have the right to be in the street during the 10 P.M weeday and during midnight. Teenagers can be anywhere at any time during 10 P.M and during midnight weekend. The City council should not accept the adoption of this new curfew law for all teenagers.

Curfews can't keep teenagers out of trouble, teenagers are as same as adults, they can chose their own decision about what they want to do during any day of the week, they are only unfairly interfere in young people's lives!!!!. My life can be one example. I woke up at 5 am to get ready to come to school, after school i have to go work during 4 P.M to 11 P.M. I work only 7 hours because, i need some times to do my homeworks, and some time to use my phone, facetime my friends and time to read my favorites books.

If the law of the curfew is adopted and i'm in the street at 11 P.M, it would mean that i'm breaking the law of the curfew!!!. Some teenagers have no parents, their parents are in their country, or they abandoned their childrens. For this reason have to work after school and sometimes they have to work extra shifts. The reason why i am desagree with this curfew law is because, not all teenagers that are on the street during weekdays and weekends are wasting their time, they are working hard to have a better future.

This is a hard debating between be desagree or agree with this curfew. The city council is not keeping teenagers out of truoble. Teenagers are owners of their onw lives, some people may think that adopting the curfew is one of the best ways to keep teenagers safe. The best way to keep your teenagers safe is teaching them to not use drugs and alcohol. If teenagers use drugs and alcohol they may not follow the intructions of their parents. Their parents need to teach how to have the same education at home, in school, or outside the school.

During the weekends most of the teenagers includings adults, prefer to go to parties, and some people prefer to say at home with their families. If the people go to the party and came back from the party at 12 A.M, the police will arrest them because, they are breaking the curfew law. The city council should not adopt this curfew law, they will not be helping teenagers to how life work, working during nights. we are teenagers, if we take our responsability at school, we can also take responsabilities outside the school.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,7.0,6.605328559875488,7
FBC421A7BE79,"Generaly saying,people do accomplish more if we are always doing something.

in live if you don't want to do anything you will become blind to the society and be left undone because you have waste the day and time not doing accomplishing things with your live but focus on things that are not accomplishing your live. for example: playing video, twitter, face time, and snapshot. all these thing are waste your time all depends on the way it being use. and if you fall in that position of not accomplishing when you get older it's going to effect you. example: you will start rubbing,mudring because you didn't put your mind on accomplishing anything. it is also important to accomplish more. my reason for saying this is the more you do accomplishment the more you go farward in anything. for example; by making good grade in school, by being a good leader, and also helping people if they do needs help all these things you are accomplishing something. everybody do want to accomplish something in life but you have to work for it.

To be sucessful you have to accomplish everything in life. any people in this world today, have gotten good position for their accomplishment. i know, some time it's hard to do but like i said if you want to accomplish something in life you have to work for it. for example: like the brids we see today they have to go through a lot of stages. bruds cannot just be born and start to fly the same day they have to go through before they fly. so they accomplish their flyinh by process and it is the same as human we go through processes to accomplish things we want. our lives go by days and hours the day we see today will never return so why not accomplish somehting within that day because when that day is gone you have waste thime,and abilities to accomplish something.

lets be honest the world today need someone that never give up. it is amazing for some one to reward you for your accompishment. today many of us went to be a doctor,lawyer, and so on but, we are not putting the effort and time. one way to accomplish thing in live is this pay attention to things, learn from mistake using your time and effort if you found yourself doing this you are going to accomplish many thing. the reason why many poeple don't accomplish things is this they don't pay attention not willing to ascept their wrong doing and don,t use their time and effort. for example; i want to be a doctor i have to pay attention in biology class, read books, and also make good grade i'am accomplishing what are want to do because are do it constanly and i love it to so that give me more intrest in doing it.

therefore, to make the world a better place we have to do better talking by mouth and not putting to action it don,t work so if you ready want to accomplish some thing in live you have to always do it never give up and always found your self doing something not playing arround be a better you for your tomorrow.

FC211F7815F2,"Studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement, is to start an afterschool homework club. Students stays for homework help, finish their homework early, and turn in their homework on time. So ,we all have our homework to turn in on the next day. They're a lot of students that do their homework, dont do it, or some students might said, ""I forgot my homework.""

Should people bring their homework to school? Of course, or what, you're just going to leave it at your house and forget to bring it at school. Always do your homework and do your homework at home or afterschool. On the next day, just prepare to turn in your homework and if you forget to bring your homework, ask your teacher and give a good reason why you left your homework. Then you can turn in your homework on the next day.

People need help on their work. That's why they needed an afterschool homework club. They can go to their teacher to help what they need. If they go to afterschool and get a good helper, then they can be better and will know what they learn at afterschool. We can improve all of the students to get a good knowledge and success, to be a good students.

So students needs to turn in their homework and get a good grade. So, if you want that grade, you have to achievement and pass the class and get good grades. Turning your homework is one of the important grades to success and go your grade up. You can help other students that needs help on a subject. Why, because helping someone will learn from you and they will know how to solve a problem. They might do something and turn in. That's why people needs a good grade and be smart on something they known.

4256A9A1767F,"In my oppinion people should seek guidance from expercts and authorities about life's important matter instead of making thier own desisions. A few people may not agree, but I personally strongly agree with my oppinion is very important. I belive asking and sharing our ideas lead us to making better desisions. Here are three reasons why seeking guidence from expercts and authorities is better than making desitions on your own.

In addition, confusion is one of of the most common reasons why people end up making bad desistion. A lot of people might not know what it is going on or how to make a good desicion because it is probably their first time going through a situation they have never been in. I was not in a position to make my own desistions, because I was young and confused on what was going well untill I asked someone for help,but when I started making my own desitionsions

Also, it leads you to do better when you communticate with others and gives you a better understanding on why making your desision with others helps you out more. When I began to speak out about my desisions to my closest friends and they helped me make me feel that I was not going through it alone and they always made sure that the desision I understand the desision I was taking before even making my next move. It honestly helped me a lot.

Furthermore, it makes your life less stressful. You talked about what you were stressing about instead of bottling It all up. It is like some stress relive. For exapmple, you have a big heavey backpack full with books inside and when you get some out the way, you take some books out , and the backpack feels less heavy. I would feel relive on talking about what was stressing me out when I had to make a desision, because it is hard.

In conclusion, Not only do you make a desision but you uderstand, you communicate, and you feel relived about your desision. In the end of the day you would feel not only good about your desision but sure about yourself and the people around you. These were the three reasons on why you talking to experts and ahorities about life is important.                      ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,2.5,6.0,6.872340202331543,7

If the students don't do that job they might be in a big problem. in SCHOOL_NAME if the students do not turn theirs phone off and it rings during class the teachers automatically will take the phone from the students.

Eventually the parents have to come and get the phone from school and give them to their kids.

If the students bring their phones to school they will text their friends, call their friends and take pictures.

In contrast if the students are doing those jobs during classes and there were no school rules the students would play with their phone during class time.

During class time students might listen to their favorite songs on their phone and don't pay attention to the teacher which they will get a worst citizenship in their report card and they will not graduate and they will feel sad and shocked about what they have done to hurt them.

Imagination is more important than knowledge because you get to picture or about what you want to do when you grow up or something you want to do with your life or your friends. You can imagine all that by thinking about it or just doing it when you want to.

I remember one time my mom ask what I want to do or to be when i grow up I said a soccer player and I said i imagine me playing with one of the best player playing with me mom said but you have to practice very hard to even make it on the team and I said you going to see on your television very soon. Knowledge is not important than imagination because knowledge you have to learn about it to make sure you no what you talking about but imagination is when you imagine something in your life that you know is going to happen in your life one day is as fun as everything in the world that can make you happy in life or a point of your life.

So ne time i was playing soccer with my friends outside in the rain and I imagined myself making it on the school team I was very happy when I made on the school team. So the next day i went to school and they were calling out the people who made it on the school team, So I head the call my name and I was very happy because they called my name out and it is because I imagined myself making it on the school team and every worked out good, So I was the best soccer player in middle school, now i can not wait when I am famous and ever body know my name.

FB4D3D883D49,"Cellphones has already taken place of your calendar don't let him take place of your family. Some people think cell phones should be allowed in school but other says it is just destruction. Cell phones shouldn't be allowed in school because it is destruction,increase cheating, and less use of dictionary.

Firstly, cell phone is destruction. For example the one person I know was always on her phone. Moreover as her phone vibrate she just open the phone and start checking messages. As result she was not distracting herself but also class and teacher. Later on due to this habit she couldn't pass SOL.Because phone was destruction for her. Last year one of my friend didn,t uses much phone in the first quarter she got really good grade. Furthermore in second quarter she starting using cell phones more. Moreover in school she do all her work in rush so that she could have more time for cell phones. As a result her grade starting getting worst she ended up felling her both SOL.In her first quarter she has six A and one B but in fourth quarter she have five A,one B ,and one D.Furthermore one of person couldn't pass SOL and grades also go really worst.

Secondly,cell phones is not only destruction but also increases cheating. For example one of my friend whenever give test she take picture and send question to other student. The teacher make same test for both classes. Furthermore she can help them by giving them answers in test but in SOL

she couldn't help them. As a result they will end up might be felling SOL.Moreover one of person was giving a final exam in school she was also texting one of her friend all the answers and the answers she didn't know she was also using Google for them. Most of the question was about vocabulary she was just searching vocabulary and writing on final exam. Cell phones are not only increasing cheating but also student thinks they are helping others which is wrong. The both person was doing wrong one of them was sending question to her friends other was searching from Google.

Thirdly,cell phones is destruction,moreover increase cheating furthermore there is less use of dictionary. For example one of my friend prefer searching from phone rather than using dictionary. The main reason for using cellphones instead of dictionary was because from dictionary you have to find a word it take more time than cell phones. Furthermore in cell phones you just have to type a word and cell phones will give you meaning ,and synonyms. Moreover one of my friend always uses phone for searching a word meaning she never use paper dictionary but in SOL they didn't allow you to use phone. As a result she struggle using paper dictionary. People want easy way to do things that is why they uses cell phones instead of using dictionary.

In conclusion, some people think cell phones are helpful in education but other thinks it is destruction. Cell phones are not helpful in education because it is destruction for students,increase cheating,and less use of dictionary .Students are keep checking on their phone. Cell phones is also increasing cheating student text test question to each other also can search from Google.

When you work alone it can get very boring and you may need help with something but also if you are working alone you can work at your own pace. With a group you may be pressure to finish something quicker but your teamates can help you with that. When someone is in a group they can act silly at times and give the teacher or the boss a headache but, when they focus they can get work done faster. Working with a group is not just for the work, it is for people to be social and so people can see how they act around other's. You can learn new things with other people that you did not already know or you can teach them something but at some point the whole group teaches everyone somehting new.

Working in a group you would probaly be pressured to stop being foolish and get your part done but if you have nice teamates then someone can help you with your part. Some people, perfer to work alone because they do not like to be pressured for no reason but in some ocasions those people are the one's to turn in late work or has incorrect information. In a group they correct you if you did not do something right and hellp you out if you ask for help and someone can help you becuase that's what a group is for to help each other learn new things. If a due date is coming up there can be so much pressure because maybe you have not even done your part or you are just lazy to do it some your teamates start to get mad at you and you do not know what to do.

Learning new things can be fun with a group because you might not be shy to ask questions so you learn new things and maybe someone else from your group learn that same thing as you. If the group learn's something new then they can use that thing in the future when they work alone or with a different group. Helping each other is one of the easiest way to get done with something but working alone you may take longer because you have to search up things and some times they do not know where to start.

Teachers put students in a group to see how they act around each other like if they act goofy or if they do not have self control. When working with a group there has to be self control because if the group is just being goofy then they would not get work done and they can get a bad grade and not work together in that class ever again. The teachers see how the students act and they see who should be with who and who should not be with someone. Working alone the teachers know that it will be quite and they would not know how the students act with friends around or a group.

Working together is way better then working alone because you become more social and not so much of a shy person. A group can also help you focus and have a good time all at once, also they can hep with having a good grade in that class because they helped you a lot. Students learn new things when they working with people and they might not be so shy. Working in a group has more benefits then working alone because working alone you have to do everything on your own and with a group they can all help.",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,7.0,6.496243000030518,6

One person who shares wisdom to me is my friend because, we love each other, we care about each other, and just giving out wisdom, is just nice.

FD9A86C8DA31,"I do agree with Churchill statement because life ain't easy and you will lose a lot to order to became successful in life. The reason I agree with this statement is because I know how it feels to lose it all to order to became successful and that was to became a professional soccer player to proof everybody that left me hanging

, that did me dirty , and people that don't want seeing me to win. This made me go harder for what I want to became in life I really put all my effort into something I love playing since my childhood , it always kept me from trouble and ending up in the street. I remember when I was 13 years old I use to play for a really good team that I never thought I could make but I did and never had a changes to play on the field because the coach thought I wasn't ready to play. He use to doubt about my ability on the field and that put me down , I left the team then stop playing for 6 months but I was start to think that I shouldn't give up and 2 months later I made Super Y where all the good player are at and good teams . I

only played 6 games and i didn't do good or bad but I did alright and one of the coaches love my playing style , he got me on a travel team. My first season was where I proved everybody wrong and scored 38 goals 16 assist , I was proud of myself for not giving up and kept my head up from what I was going thought , Next season I got called up to play for the first team I was amaze for what I accomplish in a year. It was amazing when I played for the first team because I went to tournaments that were big like the state cup and college showcases I never experience , my team came in first place for two season and almost won state cup. The next year I made NPL and been getting mail from academy team and one team from Spain to go play for them but I lost those changes and that when I just stop giving up because money was a issue and I was begin to get in trouble that when I lost it all the hard work for nothing. I had my hope up for things to get better and one day I was listing to my coach , he told me I was a amazing player and I changes the game every time i'm on the field then he told me dont give up on something you really good at cause I can see you going pro or playing division one soccer and get draft from there , so I listed and now I got 5 division one school that went me to play for there school and some others.

This is why I agree with this statement because if you lose faith in yourself you will never became successful in something you love doing and playing even if it gets hard keep your head up and focus on the main goal to become successful. This rapper said "" at your best you are love and don't let nobody pull you from your grind"" and I like what that quote say because it true once you became big everybody you know that talk upon your name and never been by your side will come back and say how they use to know.

Technology makes thinks much easy and quickly for everyone, If you dont have a car you can shop online. People can buy food, materials, video games, books and everything that in necessary. Technology also makes more easy to talk with people that is far away and you miss. Last year I call my grandmother and she never had a cellphone before, she was surprise that she was talking to me event that she is far away from me that makes me so happy and I was thinking that if technology does not exist I dont know how to communicate whit does people that are far away from me.

The limitation of human contact has something to do with technology because there is some people that dont know how to use technology they think that technology is the only way and they feel like there is no other friends but that wrong because technology its a tool for human and if we know how to used its going to makes us life much easy.

Firstly because everyone should always keep trying because we should know that nothing come easy we have to keep trying. For example i use to have one friend who use to hate school because of his math class. He use to tell me that whenever he used to go to his math class he would feel stupid because he don't understand anything in that class,Whatever his teacher use to teach,but he never give up when he was in school he keeps trying and trying until he gets better in his math class and now he is a math professor. He always tells me that don't ever stop trying believe in yourself.

Secondly i would like to say that success dosen't come without struggle. If we want to be successful we should know that there is going to be a lot of struggles in our path. However if we stay strong and positive we will be successful one day. If we become successful we can set an example for people who don't try or people who just get fail one time and then they stop trying. We can be someone's inspiration maybe people we get inspire by us one day. For example i failed my driving test twice but i didn't give because i knew that already that getting my license is not going to be easy. After taking classes for driving and learning how to drive from my parents. I got my license when i gave the test after second try. I was so happy and proud that i didn't give up and i just kept trying.

lastly i would like to say that Failure also teaches us some good experience in life that we will never forget.

All this experiences are very beautiful in our life because we can share this experiences with people and put posistivty in the people. who give up easily or the people who failed once and think that that's it with their life the cannot be successful now. Everyone should always keep trying because success is not gonna come to us we have to go to success. Success doesen't need us we need success.

Some people agree that its hard to change your first impression base on the experiences you had.

The type experiences does change the first impressions because of the type personality you have.

Everyone has different personality like one person could have a personality that is outgoing, shy, Funny, boring, energetic. All of these personality defines the first impressions that you show to people. But not just other people also to your boss the work forces has a big statement of the type of first impressions you put on, work is the most eithc way of showing how professional you can be during an interview or in work.

Experiences brings the first impressions to people you could have experiences all of things and it could tell what kind of person you are. You could join the army and people could tell by the way you look. Every experiences could be different for other people you may have travel our world or graduated college and high school it could tell on the experiences that you have witness in your life that you live in.

Your appearances means everything in experiences and first impressions in life you, probably could be wearing baggie pants or long shirt people, your hair could be messy, wearing shoes with holes on them , might judge or amuse lots of things about you. But having a great appearances has the could change the impression i'm wearing a nice beautiful dress with nice black heels, my hair is nicely done. people could look at me and think "" oh where did she get that dress"" or "" her hair is looking very pretty today."" people judge first impressions by appearances.

01A65BA4080E,"Most schools let students use their cell phones during class for educational purposes, however, other schools don't think that allowing students to use their cell phones would be better than using computers in the library or computer labs, by allowing students to use their phones there will be a higher chance for them to get distracted doing what they are not supposed to intead of doing their assignments. Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because students would pay more attention to their phones than their teachers.

Some teachers would rather take their students to the library or to a computer lab to use the computers to do assignments, instead of letting them use their phones because students would not get their work done. For example in my school we used to have the school WIFI on our phones but that only made us get distracted so my school decided to take down the WIFI from our phones, this year we were given chromebooks so we can do our class works in class without having to go to the library or a computer lab. We can take our chromebooks in any class to do our assignments and it's made a huge impact on every student because now no one is ever on their phones, and we pay more attention to our teachers.

By letting students use their cell phones during class will increase the chances for them to get distracted, for example one day my english teacher gave us a reaserch paper and told us that we could use our cell phones to search up important documents, while we were doing our work one of my classmates' phone went off because she got a snapchat notification and everyone got distracted, the next day everyone was using their phones in class and no one was doing the work that we were assigned to do. Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because it will not benefit them, this would be a distraction to not only students but teachers as well.

If schools let students use their phones there also will be a higher chance that students' grades will drop, and a lot of parents would not be pleased. My parents would get extremely mad if my school let us use our cell phones during class because they know I would easily get distracted, if we were aloud to use our phones the whole school would be a disaster. Teachers would not be happy with the idea of letting students use their phones, because every teacher wants the whole class' attention on them not their cellular devices. Some students and schools might think that letting students use their phones would be a great idea because it could probably benefit those students who might not have a computer at home, and maybe letting them use their cell phones during class to do their assigments would help them, but that doesn't mean that every student has to use their phones too.

Schools should not let students use their phones for educational purposes because it would be a big distraction for students and teachers. By allowing us students to use our cell phones it's only increasing our chances to get distracted and it would make our grades drop.

Us students should not be aloud to use our cell phones during school because it will not benefit us, it will only make us distracted.

83FEB27FD31E,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with other people. I agree with this statement because the internet can be helpful in many diffrent ways, although technology could be bad in some cases. Reasons why I agree is beacause society now a days tends to have less time due to work, school, housecare and much more.

People are unable to go to the libraries, go shopping, not even hang out with friends nor family members. The internet lets collage and high school students access books and helpful items for them when their too busy to head to the library or use a computer, it makes it eaiser for them to study and finish homework from home or their dorm. They get more rest and free time although the library is a helpful resource, students don't have the time and energy to go but the internet can help in many ways there are apps and helpful websites on many different topics.

Technology also helps new mothers and moms to shop online for groceries ,clothes, and more when mothers are too busy taking care of the house, cooking and caring for their new borns or childern they don't have the time to go out shopping. It also allows teens to shop on websites instead of making their parents take them, and even prevents them from driving theirselves and making parents worried. Online shopping can also help people who serve the country like military, navy who travel far and leave for a long period of time to shop and send goodies to their loved ones.

Finally, it allows childern and teens to entertain theirselves, For example when parents are making lunch or dinner or doing something busy. Kids can be entertained by a video, movie or game on a cellphone, tablet, or laptop their are many cool apps for childern to learn and play. If teens aren't allowed to hangout with freinds they can also play with each other online through electronic devices. The internet also allows family members who aren't close to each other to text and even video call each other.

In conclusion, the technology is a helpful and easy way for online shopping, entertainment, and much more. Just by a click of a button you could recieve your items at your door steps making you happy and relieved.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.101874351501465,7
1214E4605B0C,"Should the school break system be change to 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break , and a week off in the spring. Some educator feel that the summer break is to long and students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Others argue that summer break is for students to take a mid break and stop think about school. Schools should not change the break system, because many students and parents had already planed,what they would do during the summer, and because many students work, and by changing the break system it could affect them, and because summer break is for students to relax, get a mid break and stop worrying about school.

The school break system should not be change to 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the the spring, because many students work during the summer and many jobs do not gives students the opportunity to work only a few week or days,they want students work a lest two months so they can be able to give them the jobs, otherwise they would give the jobs to peoples that can stay more time with them. For example I work during the summer, and the company that I work with, only gives jobs to persons how agree to stay more than two months with them, if the school system change, this clear is going to affect me, because I going to lose my job and it would be difficult for me, to find another job during the break, because most of the jobs do not want people, how just going to stay in the company for a few days or weeks.

The school break system should not be change , because students and parents have already planed , where they going to go, and what they going do, and if the school change the brake system, most of the plants that they had already made it, are going to be destroy . for example my bother and my parent visit my grandparents every single year and if the school break system change this could be a problem because they would have to come back more soon, and probably they may not go.

The school break system should not be change, because students have the right to have a long break and stop think about all those worksheet,quizzes, and tests that ,they had already done during the school period,summer break should be a time to relax spent time with family and friends and not a time for be think and worry about school.

Having a smile on your face when you are around other individuals shows that you have good characteristics and a great positive attitude. Think about it, who do you know wants to be around someone who kills the vibes and doesnt have fun? No one right? Because that isn't how you make friends and get people to actually want to hang out with you.

Say you had a job interview or a College interview, do you think you would get the job or get accepted if you walked in with a rude manor? When I had my Nursing Program interview last year, I went dressed up, confident in my self and happy like I really wanted to be there and this was something I'm passionate about, because if I didnt they would have never accepted me into their program. You only live once and in this country you either fail or succeed in life, some people throw it all away because they dont know how to communicate in a proper manor with another human being.

There are times when your at school and your taking a test or any kind of exam and your not confident in your self and you repeat over and over again to your friends, even to the teacher sometimes that your going to fail and then wind up really failing, because you had so much negative energy in your body that you convinced your self that your not gone pass this exam. Now your mad your grade will drop in the class and your parents are going to be upset at you because your not doing well in school.

In conclusion you must always have good vibe and a positive attitude towards everything in life because your character says a lot about who you are especially if its your first impression and your trying to show off to someone you just met and you dont want to mess that up.

There is always challenges in life where you would have to be yourself. If you can't be yourself then you should ask for advice from your family on how you can be yourself. If you aren't yourself and you've become different from yourself and its not always good. It's like letting the world win by changing you. You should always be yourself no matter what you come across, listen to you and your family, and don't lose to the world by not being yourself.

In life no matter what you come across, you should always be yourself. Don't let anyone force you to be someone else because you might not even like who you've become. People who aren't themselves usually are going through some serious stuff or just want attention. Being yourself is really hard when there are hard challenges you have come across that tries to make you different from yourself. Being yourself is the best accomplishment you can earn when in a world that is trying to make you something else.

You should always listen to yourself and your family. Getting advice from your family is the best because they've been alive longer than you and have more knowledge in how they've became there self and not anything else. Listening to yourself is good because you're doing what you want to do, what your mind is telling you. If you become something else and your mind was telling you not to, then you should re-evaluate your thoughts and be yourself. Family are related to you, they have similar mindset as you, and they should understand you more than anyone else in this world.

At the end of the day, you know who you are; if you aren't yourself its like letting the world win by changing you and losing because you aren't yourself. You're showing us you aren't capable of the world, you can't handle the world because you're not thinking about your decisions and letting the world change you. You know what you can do and can't do. If you know you can change then go for it and change. Changing can be hard but you should take it slow, think about what you want to change. It's a great feeling knowing you've changed because you know you have achieved your goal.

6A3C37AD876C,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I believe to an extent that is true, but you also have to determining the circumstances of the situation. Not always will you be able to change someones opinion about you, especially if you REALLY represented yourself very poorly. If you really would like to change someones thoughts on you, i believe you can with some work. You can always apologize for giving a bad first impression and start all over, but it all depends on what you did to leave such a bad rep for yourself.

I myself can confess that i've had my fair share of bad first impressions, but how I would see it as is a lesson on what not to do when meeting someone new. For example, you go for a job interview and not only are you not prepared to fully represent yourself but you're also late. The employer doesn't know you yet and its his first time meeting you; you showing up unprofessional defiantly won't leave a good first impression. Everyone makes their mistakes at times when it comes to meeting new people and or a new job employer; you either acted a curtain way thinking it would be okay to come off as or you said something that you thought would be harmless when really it wasn't. When it comes to meeting new people, you have to understand that some things are okay to say in the moment and other times it'd be better to just stay silent.

Many people say it almost impossible to change first impressions. I say nothing is truly impossible if you try your best to do whatever it is you want to do; if its correct a miss step you made or to simply just change someones mind about something. You can always correct mistakes even if it is a pretty big one; things might not go as planed or get resolved how you would like it to but its better to try than to not try at all. So i say i disagree that it is almost impossible to change first impressions made on someone, because i think it is possible if you're determine to get it done and done right if given a second opportunity.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,8.0,7.540241241455078,8
6B7240C22E28,"Yes i agree we can accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose. Because when we do something that will brought something good in ou life we can do. For example the President want to do something that can make everyone to be happy, he want to make sure his country look good or when parent work they don't work for themself, they work for family to be happy. I think many people do serve on porpuse to make better life. some people thing that maybe when inactivity you can't accomplish your goal but what i believe if your do something with one heart everything may going good in the life. And that why in this life you can't stop to do something can make you happy or make your life great.

The is some people are very laziness, the can not do any anything , they're job is to sit down everyday play game or drink alcohol and smoking. The some people they don't have any place to stay because they're very laziness to find a job. they're thing government can help them everything. But that still bad for someone who have two hands and two legs. And they's some people people they don't have hands and legs but they still work to make they family better life. For example American people want they're children to be educated because they want when they grow up to have better life. They don't want to see they children suffering in the life.

We need to fight for our life to be better. Because when we put laziness out of our ways everything may be good in life. And in the life we can have easy life don't make your life hard. Because when you have piece and love in your heart anything can be hard for you. When you have any problem you can try to solve yourself and don't stop to do what your heart say. we need to go through in this life. But in our life don't truth anyone and believe what your heart say. some people thing life is hard but people are the one make themself hard life. we need to not give up in our life. let work together in this life.

Let think of this why Thomas Jefferson wrote, Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity alson a serve a puporse? It's because he think if people do something together can make they're country look better place or can make people feel good for what they see in the country. For example when you have farmer and you can make sure that you farmer look good and that why Thomas want his country to look good. when you have better parent everything for you will be well.

In my my idea people don't win everyday in the life the's win and lost, or defense or loss, so we need to fucor in our life we need to stop be laziness. We need to make our country look good. we need to have love and pieceful. For when you have someone love you so much and you don't need to hater someone because you have someone who love you so much. And that why Thomas want to remind people to work hard and we can go through the goal of life.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,6.0,4.704583168029785,5
C270D47D709B,"A first Impression is the key to succes, because that is the first time a person is going to see how formal you are and makes in idea of your personality. Is very important to give the best, to let people see that you are a person capeble of making good decitions and for that, a first Impression is always good. A first Impression is more then how a person looks and talk, is telling others that you can do anything to fine a better future. A first Impression is very important because is your opportunity to let a amployer know that you are a good person for the job you are looking for.

When you are looking for a job or trying to aply for college, the first Impression is the important key for you. That can help you to achieve that goal and make a better future for yourself, it can open many job opportunities, sometimes with out needing to do a lot of work. No knowing how to give a good Impression, is something that can affect your life in a negative way, like clossing job opportunities something that is really important to achieve those goals.

For example if you talk to a employer for a job interview and you give a nice impression, that employer is going to call you back, but if is the other way and you totally did bad he or she is not going to call you back, and you will be waiting with out getting any call. Lest remenber that Impressions don't always change, and sometimes is very important to put your best and always give the nice impression not matter of who, because sometimes those opportunities can come from someone that you will never thing.

3670CB1DD363,"Even though my friend was keep failing her math exams, she never lost her enthusiasm or hope that she would eventually pass her exams. Famous Winston Churchill once said that succeeding consists of going from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm. I personally agree with his statement about success and failure, and here are my reasons why I agree with him:

My first reason is that if a person fails something and doesn't want to try again then they have a higher chance of failing. For example, what if my friend after failing her exams suddenly lost all of her enthusiasm and showed no sign of improving, then she's never going to succeed because she's no longer trying to improve. That's what a lot people do after failing something, they either get depressed or are never willing to try again and that's what causes them to fail. Somebody has to try to achieve something and even if they fail they can try again eventually. That's one of the reasons why I agree with his statement, trying again is one of the biggest things leading to success.

My second reason is that a person can be more prepared when their retaking something. For example, a person can look back on their original test and see what they did wrong the first time around so that they can improve. Another way of a person being prepared is that they can spend more time studying if they didn't have enough time to study the first time. Being more prepared can help someone understand the questions their answering and see what they did wrong the first time around.

While some people agree that succes consists of going from failure to failure with a sign of enthusiasm, others may disagree by believing that success doesn't consist of failure to failure with a sign of enthusiasm because they've taken this advice before and they've never been able to succeed in something. While this may be valid, these people might also have to keep in mind that they need to be enthusiastic and confident while taking these tests. For example, I don't think it's ever a good idea for a person to take a test or prepare for a test while their angry or arent motivated. I think this way because they'll just have a mindset that they're going to fail or that they need to get this over with as quickly as possible, which isn't good because a person shouldn't feel rushed or stressed when their working on a test. I think when people who are hopeful or confident when they are about to do a test have a higher chance of succeeding.

I agree with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's inspiring statement about how success consisits of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. My first reason why I agree with his statement is that if a person never wants to try improve themselves or try agin then their never going to improve. Another reason why I agree with this statement is because a person can be more prepared when retaking these tests like having more time to study or be able to learn from their past mistakes. I think Winston Churchill's statement is very inspiring and influential to every community that's out there, because it can be told to any person who's losing confidence in himself after failing something and can easily boost their enthusiasm.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,7.0,8.44597053527832,8

9AFAE6562E98,"The purpose of always doing something helps us get different kinds of experiences, it helps us accomplishe what we are doing and gives a purpose to what we want to do in the future. Throughout life, the experiences that you get can help keep you motivated on what you should and shouldn't do as well. In comparsion, when you are inactive you aren't benefiting from anything and you are just not getting enough experience for what you want to do in the long run. This is a major factor on how well you live your life and how you want your life to be. I do suppoort that we accomplish more when we are always doing something and it helps contributes to how we all live our daily lives.

One factor why I believe that this contributes to our daily lives is that, it helps you get an education on something new or just a job that you are interested in. While, going to school and getting an education is a major rule in a human life; it is not for everyone and it all depends on how much effort you put in and if you are willing to put in the effort as well. In many different countries and cities, not all jobs require an education all you have to do is have experience in a certain area or part that makes you want to learn more. This helps decrease inactivity and upbulid activity while you are doing something like helping your community, feeding the homeless, giving advice to young kids. It all just depends on how well you put yourself out there and willing to make a committment about it as well.

A second factor why I believe you feel accomplished by doing something is that, it gives you a purpose in life and a feeling that won't be given again. From my experience of helping kids with their homework afterschool it has always given me always a good feeling and making me proud that I am helping the community. This helped me gain self-satification for myself and let me understand the importance of showing kids at a young age how to be accomplished when you put the energy and time too. Another example I ever felt when doing somethingis when I play lacrosse , and how everytime I don't make my mile time I strive to do better for myself. Lacrosse has helped me put in an understanding on how self-satisfication doesn't come easy it takes time and effort. This benefitted me get motivated for what I should do more and always helping me understand that if I put in my time and energy then there won't be a problem on feeling accomplished. Doing something you love and getting that satisfication helps you serve purpose and feel more accomplished for yourself as well.

One last example of how always staying active can help influence your accomplishment is that you are acknowledging that you are given a purpose to uphold. I do feel like many people don't seriously take the opportunites given and it is very hard to undertake as well. I would certainly always feel accomplished when doing something that can help let others know I care and not just for my own image. I agree that many different factors can influence decision making but also making others understand how important you are to someone as well.

In conclusion, the more work you put in ;the more you are in feeling accomplished and in pleasing yourself as well. This can help give you a self-esteem boost for yourself and let others know that you are willing to put in dedication for yourself. Many people that I have talked to said that they have always felt like their ciommunity helps them grow and feel like they should give something back as well. Doing something remotely even small can benefit anyone's day in comparsion in doing nothing. Working for what you need to do is different for working for what you want to do and this helps you understand the need for self -satisfication and social-satisfication.

976E2E05C4EB,"Some businesses only work 4 days in the week maybe to conserve energy or maybe to the employers can rest one more day. I think it is a good idea to extending the school day two hours to a four days school week, but one reason that I agree with this opinion is that the student could more time to do their homework and they could work too. The schools could save more energy if we go to school 4 days per week because we used a lot of energy during school day. Many students have babies they have to care them when they are out of school this option can be benefits for this students how have to be parents and students in the same time I love this school where i am because they help the students who do not have who can care their kids.

In my point of view this option can help me and the rest of the students too, because we could do a lot of things in that day for example I have to work after school because i have to pay my rent, food, clothes and other things that a person need and If I only came only four day in the week I could work all the day and make more money to help my mom.

I agree with the businesses who only open

4 days in the week because they want to save energy and money, For example when i was in mu country my family and I always saved energy because we don't had the money to pay the energy, sometimes I forget to turn off the TV and my mom yelled me and said ""turn off the TV because you don't pay the energy."" and sometimes i get mad because i wanted to listed music and watched TV.

Some students have to do many things in the same time for example they have to be parent, student, and labor and the week is to short to them to do all the things and a day off can be so good for them because it's not easy to anyone to be responsible. I admire my mom because she was dad and mom for my and my brothers and I was think how can she do all those things and then I realized that she wake up everyday because she want the best for us and doesn't matter how tired she felt. We can't ""never give up"" because fighting.

In conclusion, I agree that the schools extending the school day two hours and we came only 4 days on the week because sometimes we feel tired and we can rest one day in the week because we have to work in the weekends too and the school can be beneficial too because they can save energy, food, water, money and a lot of other things.

ED06CD30103F,"Have you ever wondered when is it a good idea for people to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. They are many reasons why high school kids need to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. Im going to tell you why it is a good idea for high school kids to have a (an) idea of what they want to do for a living. However, some people think it's a bad idea for them to start thinking what they want to do for a living.

If people dont start knowing what they like at a young age then they will not know what the want to do in the future. We should start knowing what we want to do by the end of high school for many reasons. When we finish high school we should go straight to college so we can study about what we want to do. They're many people in the world that still dont know what they want to do; and that is because they didn't know what they want to do. You should always know what you want to do for a living once your out of high school.

People in high school only think about living life and not thinking about what they want to do fro their life. They're many people in high school (including me) that just want to live life with out a job and just got party. Life doesn't for that way. If you want to work at McDonald, Burger king, etc the you won't be able to party like you want. All your going to do is work, work, and work all day. If you start think about what you want to do for a living right now, then when your older you wont be working all day. You will be able to take a vacation or have time with your family.

Some people think that if you wait until your an adult to know what you want to do, then its better, but thats not what I think. You should know what you want to do by the end of high school. Then when your older, like in your 50s or 60s then you can retire and not bust your butt of working at a minimum wage job for your whole life.

Many people lost their time with play games, for example, 75% of childhood and young play games every day thats means that more than 1 million of kids take their time with games, so the consequence of the future of this generation can be different because right know children's starts to loss communication with parents or starts to be aggressive with others. thats a negative reason.

Now, technology helps a lot because makes more easy on people's lives. for example, During the time technology creased every day, exist apps that you can use for jobs and apps that you can use to contact others easier.

20E2B07931F3,"Once in a while we all have been heard a phrase; ""TRY, TRY, UNTIL YOU SUCCED"". We all have been gone through failing, at some part of our lives. But we never give up and we do our best. And at the end we get more of it. Yes we accomplish more if we are always doing something. There are few people who don't agree to this statement. They say doing something more will not let you do other work. But rather than seating ideal, we should always try new things around. Trying new things can give new experience. Also, you can get better at things. And, moreover it also makes you strong. Rather than seating ideal, doing nothing; we should always keep on trying new things.

We humans always have dreams of doing things like: Sports, Cooking, Adventure activities, getting into music, dance, and many more. Doing something and trying out new things will always give you new experience. I wanted to learn guitar from my childhood but, it was not possible when i was in school. During my last summer break i joined guitar classes. It was next level experience to me. I learned so many new things which i never knew about guitar. There, i also met new people and made new friends. Meeting new people and knowing interesting facts about their lives is also a new experience.

On the other hand their are some people who says trying new things don't give you experience, and it also wastes your time. But if we want to at least full fill our dreams then we have to keep on working hard.

There are few people who argue; doing same things everyday won't give you anything and you will also not able to focus on other things. But that's not true. Doing same thing again and again can make you better and you can be best in the future. let's just talk about me when i joined my guitar classes. On the very first day i didn't knew nothing about guitar. Their were lots of things like: cords, tunes, vocal. This all were like a big giant algebra equation which were kept in front of me, in which i didn't even knew how to solve for x. I knew a little bit of knowledge how to play with guitar string, but i never knew much things in details. On the very first day when i went to my guitar class i was not really good. But after continuing playing for a month i actually started improving at that. And today i'm really good at playing guitar.

There are many individual who says that trying new things is a fail. And later it demotivates you and make you feel depressed and upset. Many of us our not really good at things. We fail at many things at first. In this situation many of us give up and don't try to take a second chance. But do we actually know that failure is the biggest key to success and it also teaches you many lesson. I'm not really great student who can Handel math. I failed in algebra1 in my 9th. Every test, every quiz, i used to get D or either F. But failing at same things again and again until i started getting good grades thought me so many new things. And it also made me more stronger. Failing makes you more stronger so that in future also you can fight with it.

In conclusion seating ideal will never make you succeed. Trying new things is a opportunity to learn new things and explore things around you.                       ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,6.0,7.291908264160156,7

84DBCFD80902,"Technology

Technology helped many people in many different things. Technology brightens the future, and it will take the world forward to do many things using technology. Now you can do whatever you want to do online without moving from your place, You can text many people from all around the world, Google anything you need to know information about, book tickets and watch many places online. The no limit use of technology had positive effects on the people's life, but it also had negative effect on them like playing online 24 hours, or using your phone or you laptop during class and thats affects people negatively.

Technology is important in many things because it helped people's life to become easier. Many people uses technology a lot in making important stuff and that has a positive effect on our lives. Doctors uses technology in many things and for many reasons, They use it for surgeries and saving people's lives. Workers uses technology in building houses, roads and buildings which makes it easier for them and saves money and time.

By talking about technology, i would like to say that it is used daily in our lives, in many things. Everyday people drive their cars to work, school or clubs, They use their phones and laptops daily. Pilots, teachers and doctors uses technology, But it should be used right and in a good way. We use technology in schools and it helps students to graduate or study. We also use technology in protecting the country. Writers or teachers and other people can finish their work from home using their devices.

As technology has a positive effect on people's lives, it also has some negative effects. Some countries uses technology in wars. Some people uses technology in hurting other people, like bullying them online or sharing bad things about them. Also many people uses technology in terrorism by making bombs and weapons which does not help the people at all, but it ruins their lives. Some people uses technology in making bad movies which children can watch later.

As i end my essay i say that technology has many positive effects on peoples life, it helps in many ways and many things, it made life easy. without technology we would not be here right now and we will not have a brighten future. Technology has positive effect on people's lives more than the negative effects, All we need to do is just use technology in the right way, The way thet we can help people with.

96A7646236BF,"I agree with him because, we all have a specific dream or mission we want to accomplish and every dream or mission have a standard end point on less you expecting something far more better than what you are having or where you are at that particular time or moment.

Taking myself as an example or personal experienced person,I had always wanted to be a model when I was kid which I still want to be, but one thing have noticed is that you can't do anything on your own without sometimes you need help from people around you. Becoming a model was my idea and something I think it will be better for me and nothing beyond that standard; was calling people for help, applying from one agency to the other but there was no help. Sometimes people even want to take advantage of that to use for their satisfaction(sexually) even though I know that is bad I still wanted to do it because of the goals I have set for myself .

But then I got to realize I have to wait for the right time to come else people will take advantage of me. If I had never mastered it wouldn't have any experienced and would have never grow because I thought it was easy.

Life haven't be easy after loosing my dad some years ago,used to have a lot of plans in the nearest future with my dad. Was planning on graduating and buying a big house for us when I find myself a good job, but since I lost him everything just shattered and i don't know what to do. Am now living with my mom and step dad so they the ones providing for me; I don't work,I can't buy personal stuff and that makes me feel bad ,it makes me feel like am not doing anything in this world. Sitting idle will never let me grow until I do something better for myself.

In my opinion we have to set a goal for ourselves at a certain point so that we won't rush or stuck in between things , and also not everybody or anybody have to master things before they take a step and things work out for them well, some even have experience from childhood.",3.5,3.5,2.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,6.441386699676514,6
1EA990257725,"To be successful in life we have to learn from our mistakes first, that way we will appreciate the things that we will have in the future.

I agree with Churchill's statement because most of the time is hard to make our dreams come true, but if we really want to do something we can do it, because everything is possible in life. For example my biggest dream many years ago was to learn how to draw. I always dreamed being someone who could create art from anything. But there were many reasons that almost made me forgot about that dream. Another reason of why I think that failure could lead us to the best things in life, is because if we dont't try, we won't never know if it could be possible. Also failure is not something that we should be afraid of, I think that failure can give us experiences in life that can lead us to success, things and experiences that only life can offer us.

Failure in life, for me is just another opportunity to try again something but with the same or more enthusiasm. For example, when I started learning how to draw or paint, there were many reasons that almost made me forgot about my dream. One of the mean reasons was that I didn't have enough materials to make a simple peace of art, it was hard for me because in my country I didn't have the same opportunities that I have now. And I went from failure to failure but I always tried to forgot about negative things and I was just focused about being someone different in life. Now that I'm better at drawing and also I have the materials that I always wanted, I'll keep getting better and I can say that it wasn't easy but it worth it. I know that I still have a lot to learn, i'll keep follow my dream, and I know that one day I'll say I FINALLY DID IT.

Another reason of why I agree with Churchill's statement, is because most of the time we don't see what we have until is gone. And failure can lead us to the success, because it can give us experiences that only life can offer. For example if we do something wrong we know that we won't be able to fix the past, but the only thing that we can do is to learn from our mistakes and try to be better in the future. And that is why I think that failure can lead us to success because if we don't know how hard is to obtain something important in life, we never will appreciate what we have or what a person is doing for us. And is very hard to imagine something that we haven't experienced, is hard to try and learn from what we hear than learn from what we have being true. That is why we shouldn't be afraid to do something or to try new things in life, because nobody was born knowing things, only life can give us the knowledge to learn and teach.

We shouldn't be afraid of fall through, because life is to do new things everyday. Life is to live the way we want, having in mind that nobody is perfect and it's fine to make mistakes, but we have to learn from them. For example, many years ago I was afraid to leave my country, for many reasons I though that I wouldn't make it. But my mean motivation to come to this country, was to see my father for the firs time after 18 years. I was scared to fail, but at the same time I saw that opportunity like the greatest thing that I ever had. That's another reason of why I agree with the statement, because like all the rest of the people i'm not perfect. But I'm proud of some of the decisions that I had made in the past, and at the same time I learned from my mistakes and I'll keep learning.

The hardest things in life, are the things that will always worth it. I share Churchill's idea because you have to suffer before to triumph. Everybody can try and teach you something, but your best teacher always is going to be life. To fall through is not a defeat, is a new opportunity to do something better. And is fine to failure in order to find success, we just have to stand up and try again but with the same or more enthusiasm.

16005A45A20A,"There's 90% of people in the world that wants to be someone in life, but some people never had the chance or some people just gave up on school,and now they regret it. In the past few years, there has been many teenagers that go to college and try to do a career that they think they are able to work with, but after few days of studying for that career,they see that that's not for them, and they just drop out. Our schools and our parents have been trying to help us decide what we really want to do in our future before we enter college, that way we don't do the same mistake some people did. Now schools have a program where you get to choose what career you think you are interested in, and see if it's really what you want for your future. That way you have a chance to either stick with it or look for other career you could be interested in.

I want to be able to see if the career I want to take it's really for me or not. I think whatever career someone chooses, it shouldn't just be for the money, it should also be for some that makes you happy and that you are going to be able to stick with your whole life. My friend Generic_Name graduated in 2014, and he started to attend to Generic_school. He studied to be an architect, but the only reason he wanted to be an architect was because he wanted to help his family out with some money. Generic_Name was struggling to be an architect, because it was a lot of math, and he wasn't really good with numbers. What Generic_Name really liked to do was to fix cars with his older brother. He couldn't do it no more, he dropped out of college, and started working with what he knew was gonna make him happy. He worked for a whole year as a mechanic and saved money, that way he could have his own business and help his family out. He finally did it, he has his own business now and whenever there's a problem with my mom's car or my dad's car, we go to him. This is what I'm talking about, he never had the chance to see how hard that career could be and if it was going to make him happy. I don't want to do the same mistake, I want to know what I will be getting into and see if that career really is for me.

If you give me the chance to go,visit,and learn about the career I'm interested in. It does not only help me to see if It's really for me or not but I will also learn new things I didn't know and those things, they could help me in life. I want to be doctor and to get there, you have to go through a lot. As right now, I'm attending to a nurse class where I learn the basic things like knowing how to do blood pressure, learning body parts and learning a lot of vocabulary. I also know three languages: Spanish, English and Latin. After finishing my nursing class, I want to attend to Generic_school, because I've heard their doctor and nursing class is the best. The only reason I want to be a doctor is to help people out and be able to keep them healthy without any problems. My dad wanted to me to be an electrician because that's what he is, but I told him that wasn't really my thing. He taught me all he knew, that way if i ever have a problem with that, I would know what to do. One time i went to a friends house, and it was already 9:00 pm. Out of nowhere, the lights of the all house went off. So what me and my friend did was, turn the flashlight on of our phones to be able to see. His parents were freaking out, because they knew it was late already and there probably wouldn't be any electrician that would pick up the phone. I told my friend that this i could fix this because my dad already taught me how to do it. I called my dad to make sure I was right, since he's the one that knows everything about it. I was able to fix it and turn the lights on again at my friend's house. They thanked me and were surprised for knowing all this kind stuff already. Every career is important, it might not be the one for you but you will always learn new things that will help you in life, like it helped me.

There might be people that say to just look for a job where you get paid well, or people that say a career is too much because you have to study a lot, so I'll just go and work as a waitress. Yes, it is important to try to get a job that pays you well, everyone likes to make money. But if you don't like the job you are doing everyday, then you won't ever be happy with what you are doing. That's why you have to find a job that's really for you. You do have to study a lot to have a career, of course you have to. Because you are not only helping yourself, you are helping other people that's going to need your help. This is why it's important to know what you really want for yourself.

I am writing you this letter because i want to know what I am going to get into, I want to know if this career really is for me, because I want to make sure I stick with my decision. Like I said before, if It's not what I want, then that's okay because I've learned new things that will always help me in life. If it's not for me, then there's always another way, you can look for other career and see if you are interested in. I know there's more people that probably want the same chance as me, but I hope you choose me. It's not just because the money I want this chance but also because I want to help people out. I want an opportunity to see what I really want.

62243789233B,"In today's society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self.

Michelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called

Masterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so.

Taking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks don't turn out the way you wanted them too. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. Another example is having a meeting for a job. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve.

Michelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve.

A great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy.",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.3580322265625,8
BE9FA3F07682,"Have you ever had to make a very important and difficult choice? Most people have trouble making right choices. Everything we do in life is a choice and those choices that we make dictate the type of life we are going to lead and when we understand that we start to take ownership of our life and disign it hower way we want to. Seeking multiple opinions from others is an excellent way for someone to make a more benificial choice because You can find out other peoples point of views, What most people would prefer, and you can use their personal opinions to help you with yours.

Finding out other peoples point of views is a great way for someone in need of making the right choice to do. There are so many people who think different and have different point of views. Some people might think the same as others, and some might have great opinions that can really positivly impact someones life. Finding out other peoples point of views is a great way to make the right choice because sometimes you don't know what is right for you and you dont know what choice to make and then you get stuck. In these kinds of situations finding out other peoples point of views can help you with you choices and not be stuck.

Finding out what most people would prefer is also another great way for a person to make the right choice. Because you will learn what the majority of the people would do, and their opinions might be diffrent from yours, and if they are very diffrent from yours then you know that your choice is probably not the right choice to make. If I was in a situation where I had to make a right and difficult choice I would see what the majority of the people would do to make the right choice that would positivly impact me and would make me be successful.

Using other peoples advise is a great way to make a good choice for yourself. Because if you use other peoples advise it can help you make dissicions that have not even tought of. Sometimes if you don't know if your choice is the best choice that will help you succeed it is really helpful to get the advise from someone who makes good choices in their life and knows if the choice will help you or not help you at all. If I had to make a choice I would go to people who make great choices in ther lives and know if a choice is a choice that will put you on the path to success or if it wont and will just make everything harder for you and would make you just make worse choices. It is very important to take advise from others, you never know it might actually make you be so successful in life.

Making choices can be hard I myself had to make difficult choices, and when I do have a difficult choice to make I go to people to learn about their opinions. Because every single time I had to make a very hard and difficult choice taking the opinions from others helped me make the right choice and be successful. I still have to make choices today, and I still take the opinions and advise from others I admire, Because I know that even the most successful people like to get the help from others to be successful, that is how you become a successful person in life and make the right chioices. Seeking multiple opinions from others in an excellent way for someone to make a better choice because You can find out other peoples point of views, What most people would prefer, and you can use their personal opinions to help you with yours.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.5,8.0,7.670536518096924,8
9A76FBF5B3FC,"Humans create technology to help them getting their work done faster but in this case i whould like to say that if people use technology for everything that they need help with they cant be succesfull with that sometimes people use technology for bad stuff forexample. A teacher told a student to write an easy about Thomas Jefferson and student was being so lazy to think about it or use the text book to help him insted that he used his phone and copy some one else thoughts about Thomas Jefferson so this is bad for his future because this way he have'nt learned any thing about Thomas Jefferson. So this is the negative effects on then peoples who always use techonology to help their self out cant be succes.

Before humans create technology people was axctive and they do their all work by their self by communicating with others that way he will get to know other people and they will get to know him and now days technology make humans to be on Social Media or play video games and people dont communicate with their families becuase of these new thecnology people are so busy with it no one have time for each other people need to stop addicted to use thecnology too much and start communicating with others.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,6.0,5.052113056182861,5
2C8802241F51,"Doing More Work

I think Thomas Jefferson quote he wrote ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" is right. I think that we accomplish more if we getting the work done faster working hard, and getting more people to always to work on it.

Getting the work done faster can help. if we are working all day faster and faster we might get tired but people could get more stuff done. If we are building a house and we work on it everyday but some people are just working slow as they can it can take them a year and two but if they were going to work and working faster and faster they could get more done and even get more house to work on. Some people might say that even if I'm working hard I still fail or just done accomplish of what I'm trying to get but if that happens to me I would work harder and faster so I don't fail and and I would accomplish what I'm trying to get.

If you are working hard and always working you are going to get what your trying to accomplish. Working hard mean actually doesn't mean you have to wake up in the morning a go work all you have to do is when you go to work work hard and work all your effort. Some people say that I don't have to work hard to get what I want well in my point is if its a long time goal why not make it short term goal and work hard and hard. If its a short term goal finish it in a day if you believe yourself.

Sometimes working alone can get boring and upsetting. I like to work with people that are happy and believe in there self, and they can get somewhere in there life. People like to work there friends that can distract them from what they are doing and they won't be able to focus on what they are doing. Even getting people to work can make everything easy and get the work done and get what you want to accomplish faster.

Conclusion I think that getting the work done faster and working hard can mange what you do and can get more work and you can get what u want get what u accomplish by working hard and faster. If your always working and your giving you best effort your gonna get to what u want and more.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,5.0,5.509621620178223,6
69347DB7FBF1,"I think that a positive attitude is the key to success in life, why do I agree?. The reason why I agree is because your attitude is what determines on who you are, if you are happy, showing great attitude, always positive then everything will turn out good for you. For example if you have a job as a waiter/waitress the job is expected for you to have a positive attitude towards the customer, but there are some people that don't give a positive attitude, they are the type of people to not be successful in life. Another reason why I agree is because there is one thing I notice about having a positive attitude, the attitude people give out reflects back to you, for example if people are giving you a bad attitude at a restaurant that puts you in a bad mood then your gonna give someone else bad attitude and it goes on. But when we give positive attitude towards everyone then will all be happy and no more bad conflicts between anybody, everyone will just be successful in there lives. In conclusion these are my reasons on why I agree with this statement.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,7.0,6.434512138366699,6
86A511A55117,"I think students can benefit if they are able to attend classes from home, even know the distance but learning as a option for students who wants to finish a carear or have a good job.

Take those classes online or videos conferencing is not the same thing like to be able to go to classes. In class students can ask about any question they have or get the information they are looking for, and the schools teacher can see how they are learnig but, online they don't have much oction like read a book or be able to ask any question they have to anybody.

Attend to classse is great is a oction from student to choose but is the smart oction for for student who know what they want to do in they future. Schools is a place where students have the desition by you're own. There is where students can start makeing options and try finish what they really dream. Be able to atted classes from home is hard thing to discuss but when students are able to go there is great bacause is where they have to be and never give up during that time.

School is not a principle to starts getting information about how thing are working, or what options we can choose for be a porofessional after schools. Prevent oction in schools is preposterous because that is not ducing, good octions during school.

Students who rually have the decition to go to schools even know the distace but they are benefit. that is a oction, but when they get there is alot of information and option they can lissend from teachers and other students. When they go to schools they are giving a step more every day, to them life and they are benefit in school for the alot of option they can have in schools.

Schools is a benifif for all yung people to learnd how start life, when you get out from schools and have a good job. for have the opportunite, students need finish school firts. Not matter the distance or the skills they have during that period time. after that they will see how everything is change to be better in they way.

For somo students is hard to make that decition.

But when they have the oction and they can do it is a good thing because they can learning more about and have more opportunities when they graduate from schools thay have good jobs and more oction to choose.

Some students think is preposterous to to make decition in schools, bacause is alot of oction they can choose, and alot thing they want to be but they only have somo octions. For somo of then is hinder to go and pick that oportunities.

Instance when students live far fom schools is hard to get there they need like a car to get there, but parents are allways insist to students to go to schools not matter how hard is all they wants is a good future for they childrens.

School is a personality decition in life, butsmart decition for people who is looking for good oction in life. Ertheless who finish school have more oction the people who don't finish. During school students need have to be inmate because schools is a hard time.

For students in schools is like stairway, because they walk aroung getting information, that is a good oction for teachers, to stall information and try to preparate students to then life. One way to be a perfectionist is graduste from schools.

Fanally when students finish schools they did a good job and they have more option to choose. More of they have good jods or go to college and finish a carear, and they know how follow the the dreams, because when they was in chools there was alot of skills and the crusts those over and over that was like the firts hard thing they start with, that was alot of bad action they can choose but they don't choose any of those.

First, you don't distract people. Because other people might be working on something else they want to finish. people have more important things in life. some people don't like to talk to each other.

Second, I think technology are advance. Because technology are smarter then people's. They can do work really fast. Technology can be more useful to to do work

8B1F8FCC9E56,"Working alone can show what someone can do on their own. Being with a group can mess someone up and they can do bad. Some people like to be alone because they can get more done and not get distracted. Their are three reason why working alone is better than working in a group. First reason is, working alone is good for someone because the can get more stuff done. Second reason is, you can go on your own paste and not have people rushing you. The last reason is, you dont have to worry about if someone has to do one part and not do so well on it.

First, working alone is good for someone because they can get more stuff done. You don't have to hear people talk all the time about difference things. Your friends may be playing games or texting their friends and the work doesn't get done. You can be someone that gets all your work done and when it gets to your friends helping out, they might not want to do it. In a group, people can get lazy and not do the work anymore than it ends up your doing all the work alone. Being by your self is better because you don't have to wait there for people to finish and it's more benefits. It can show you the things you can do alone and things you can't do working with a group.

Second, you can go on your own paste and not have people rushing you. Working in a group can make someone work faster because your friends may be telling you that it has to get done. When you rush something, it may not be how you want it or even not good . You don't have to get a bad grade on something you need to do good on. Some benefits could be, you can go as slow or last as you want and do things in order and get a good grade on it. It's better to take your time and go over it to make sure it's how you want it to be or less you would not find the small things you got wrong. Other benefit is you can work like however you want.

Finally the last reason is, you don't have to worry about if someone didn't do the part they had to do and not do well on it. Working in a group can be hard sometimes because you have to worry about other people's work. You have to worry about if they did it right or didn't do it at all, plan on how your going to do the work, and knowing who has to do what parts. Also if you did want you had to do and the other people didn't do their part and you guys get a bad grade, they can get mad. Some benefits are you don't have to worry about someone didn't mad at you for them not doing their own work.

Working alone is better to do because you can get more work done and go on your own paste. You don't have to worry about your group not finishing their work and getting a bad grade on it. Don't get me wrong, being in a group is helpful too because more people are there to help.    ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,7.0,7.148848533630371,7
2BA422F3619F,"This is about if i suport students atending class online at home?

i think that yes if they put their mind to it. And i think if they want to pass all their grades if they are doing school at home and they really want to do it then yes If they do the all their sentens well and all their paragh well.

Aslo i think that if they are home schooled that they might do the work when they want to do it some of them will not care about it and some might just forgetand outher will say they will do it latter.

Sometime the mom/dad dose not help the student but most of the time the student want to do home school and want to pass then yes it depends on the student. when any student dose school at home they will often not do the work they aslo dont learn all the things the the school teaches they learn what the mom/dad knows.

I will say i suport it but i also dont suport becuas like i said most kids dont do the work but also some do the work. most kids when they are home schooled the mom/dad send them to school becuas they dont know what elas to teach them some just do it just to get school over with and when the mom/dad send them to school they some times llike but they aslo end up droping out of school.

Most student do benift from atending class at home but if they put their mind to it and do the work some time they learn like that becuas theirs no one that bothers them they do the work at their own speed on what they know.

most student come to school when they are home school they dont know most of the things that they learning that is becuas they didn't learn much when they where atending the class at home online becuas they were offten on their phone most of the time not caring about the work, or becuas they sleep late. Some student do know more when they are home schooled some times more then what they a student that gose to public school.

but most students that are home school they some times want to go to public school they want to go beacus they want to learn more thing make frend they rather go to public school to learn more beacuas they benn doing home school for most of the school year. some time its beacuas of their mom/dad scared that some thing might happen to their kid they dont trust their kid going to public school beacuas they might do some bad thiing.

im sure that students benefitfrom home school some take colleg class at home some start their corears but taking online class at home or some just do the things/follow the step their perent.

sometime when they are home schooled they have to go to school beacuas they have family problems or beacuas they just dont like being home scholled no more beacuas they want to do more things they wan tot learn more beacuas they feel like they are not learing the thing that they are learnig at home.

The things they learn some times aint right if they are learnig it frome their mom/dad if they are not doing the class online. But i think if they are doing the online class doing what they have to do to know what they want to be in life get thru all the the online class.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,6.0,4.897716045379639,5
2A4D0D22C04D,"Most of us always have issues choosing between working with a group or working alone. However, both systems has lows and highs. ""walk alone and you will get faster, walk in group and you will get farther"" a simple quot that my 8th grade teacher used to tell me back then. Having said that, I believe working with a group brings many more benefits than working alone.

First of all, working alone keeps you rejected from other groups, which makes you think nobody wants to work or interact with you, by contrast, working with a group helps giving you security to spread out all thoughts you keep in mind, knowing that the rest of the group will do the same and together will even fix or improve ways and ideas to obtain an amazing work or result. Moreover, it is a gain to your mental health interact with others.

Secondly, working with a group has benefits such as: learning something new, less work, less time, more facts and others. while you working with a group you will always learn something new from others, that will support similar ideas and make it more specific, to put in another way. ""two heads are better than one"". what's more, it helps your self stem and support the way you talk in public.

I used to be the one who loves to work alone, then I realized that, ""Working in group brings many more benefits than working alone"". in my opinion, working with a group is more beneficial in many ways, always having in count the people you are surrounded by are wise people.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,6.0,7.135582447052002,7

91A922E324EC,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Yes I believe you accomplish more things in life by doing something, instead of being lazy and doing nothing. The more you accomplish things the less work you do. Thomas Jefferson once wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Inactivity doesn't serve a purpose or meaning to do anything, it leads to failure and getting nowhere in life. Accomplishment is something your responsibility to get something done, it is better accomplishing one thing than nothing.

We are taught to be responsible in life and our task to get something done. But sometimes we end up doing nothing and not getting any work done. Accomplishment is what everyone wants and it leads to be successful in life. Getting things done may be tough, but at least you are accomplishing something that you want. Everyone has a goal in life that they want to accomplish, by having a goal is doing something to get where you want to be at. If not, you won't reach your goal and you may complain about it, but its your decision you chose. If you want something done or have dreams that you want to come true, then do something about it and make a effort for it. For example, my sister always struggle with history she had an sol on Thursday and she really wanted to pass. Her goal was to study so she can pass, she study real hard for it and even stayed after school to get helped. The next day it was her sol and she ended up passing. My sister accomplish her goal she knew she struggle with history, but she tried by studying and getting help. If you want something accomplish, then make it happen even if you struggle with things it doesn't matter because trying will help you doing something by completing it.

Many people believe that inactivity serve a purpose, it doesn't though. By doing nothing won't help yourself getting anywhere in life. Laziness is a decision that you want to be or not. If you want something done and you are lazy doing the work, then you won't complete it but you will have to worry about it getting it done. For example, my brother had a lot of missing assignments to do and it was due the next day. He told himself that he will complete all his missing work once he gets home. When he got home, he ended up playing x box instead of getting his work done even though he told himself he will complete all his work. The next day the assignments were due and he got in trouble by his teacher for not doing his missing work, so he ended up getting a bad grade. It was his punishment for being lazy and not doing work, if you want something done then actually do it. Don't say you will do something if you are not going to do it. The purpose here is that laziness doesn't serve you as an excuse because it leads you having consequences and not having chances anymore. If you are lazy to do your work but you wanna get over it, then complete your work and you can do whatever you want after. You won't have to worry about anything if you complete your work. Don't do all talk about getting something done and then get mad about it, if it was your own decision that you made.

Lastly, accomplishing something will make you have more opportunities in life. If you keep following your dreams and goals it can lead you have many chances in life. The more you work hard for your future the less you have to worry about. You will fail at some point, but it is normal because everyone fails. But if you put a lot of effort on something you want or desire then you will get it. If you want to be successful in life then you will have to accomplish by doing an assignment or anything that you want to be for your future career and life. For example, my cousin was a good student she always had all A's and study for her quizzes/tests and also do her homework. Her dream school was to go to Generic_School and in able to go to that school she had to work hard and accomplish her goals. It was a hard school to get in, but she put so much effort to try to get in her dream school. The next thing you know, she ended up getting in Generic_School and she was crying in tears. My cousin accomplish her dream and she was so happy because she work so hard in school willing to get into a good university for the best of her future and herself. She had many opportunities to go to other colleges and universities, but it was her dream school that she wanted to get accepted. The purpose is that if you want something so bad in life that it is your desire for your dream to come true, you will have to work really hard for your dream to come true. Everything is possible if you try your best and even if you fail at some point you will learn your mistakes and keep moving on to reach your goal that you want to accomplish.

After all, anything is possible in life its just the decision you make and it is base on your future and yourself. What Thomas Jefferson said was correctly true because accomplishing something will make people happy getting there work done or things they have to do and won't have to worry about anything. It is a better feeling doing something at least doing nothing. Accomplishment equals happiness and successful. It is committed into doing hard work and achievement. Not doing anything won't help you and complaining about it won't help you either. It will make it worst by not doing anything.           ",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,8.0,7.042131423950195,7
AB834A70D155,"Technology allows us people to complete many task without having contact with others. People can check out book ,shop ,and play games without speaking another person. Limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on people lives here is why without technology we are nothing because we depend on the technology everyday,every second of our life.

Technology has negative effect on our life here is why .In school the teacher goes over present ion online and it does not teach the student how to do there assignment . Because of the technology there is no teacher and student connection. In my country when i was young we did not had any technology my teacher would go over the assignment and he would explain the assignment on the board and if you did not get it .He would explained it to you again thats what school should be about making a connection with the teachers. I remember when i was young me and my friends would hangout in the cafeteria we would talk about our day. But now because of the technology during lunch time all my friend just uses there phone and we dont even talk to each other. Because Limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on on peoples life.

Because of the technology we have war between country with nuclear weapon. Because of technology people do not go outside of there house. They stay home and watches movies,read book and play games cause they have the technology to do that. they don't care what happen outside even if some is dying outsides of there house the would not care because of technology makes human emotion less and makes us weaker. We depend on technology way to much. when i was young if need a book i would go to the library and get the book rather than being lazy and sit on the couch and order it online technology makes us lazy. I remember we would go to eat food out and enjoy each other company talk to each other. Nowadays people just order food online and eat inside and use there phone rather than talking to each other. There is no more human connection.

In work technology is helpful but you are always get distracted because of the technology. Human being are easy to manipulate if there is game going on and there favorite team is playing. They will forget about the work. pull there phone out and watch the game. Because of that they get fried from work than they have to find a new job and figure out how to get food. If you did not had technology we would not had that problem. The technology is making people losses there job. Sometime technology can be hurtful then being useful.

Because of technology there is more accident than there were when there was no technology. Because people when they drive they text each other and they miss a turn and get hit by a car accident happen. Because of your mistake there is another person dead and you are blame for it. cause of you somebody loose a husband,wife ,child in the accident.

In conclusion technology has negative effect on human life. Technology makes people less human and lazy and weaker,

useless also there is no more human connection because of the technology. without technology we would be cave man because defend on technology to much.",2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,5.0,6.0554962158203125,6
C85795794D51,"Forty-five percent of people in the world enjoy doing outdoor activities. Something like going to community parks, state parks, and even national parks. The other percentage of people are indoors sleeping, watching TV, or playing video games. I personally can do both, there are other days when I just want to stay in the house and there are other days when I want to get out the house and do things like playing soccer with my brother and father. Enjoyable ways to spend you time outdoors can be going to festivals hanging out with friend or even reading a book in the park.

Some interesting and enjoyable outdoor activities that I like doing is going to the zoo, going on a picnic, hanging out with friends and family, playing some type of sport, or visiting a amusement park. Away that I would spend my time outdoors is hanging out with family and friends. By doing that I can go to the zoo with friends or go to a park and play sports with them. There are many thing you can do you just have to find the right activity the you like and enjoy. Another activity that I enjoy is playing soccer with

my dad and brother we always go to the park and play with my cousin then after that we would go out to eat and its better than sitting home all day and doing nothing.

These activities can be enjoyable because you together with family and friends and that can make things fun. People can use these activities to take their minds off certain situation like problem at home or something going on at school . People can use going to the park and reading a book as an escape of reality and life and going into their imagination. There are many reason why these activities can be enjoyable. Just sitting home all day doing nothing can cause you to be lazy and hide away from the world but also going outside is good for you mental growth. My mother has always told my sibings and I that we should go outside more often and I think to myself why is it important for us to go outside if there are more problems in the world the being indoors.

I think that being outdoors can help you open you mind up more to new things and experiences. For example my friend PROPER_NAME had skin cancer and he was so scared of being out side and he wanted to hangout with his friends, play sports, and go to the park and have picnic. This story is what motivates me to go out side because I dont want the freedom of going outside to be taken away.

everyone like a little bit of fun for example last week me and my friend went bowling and then we went to the mall it was pretty enjoyable because I forget about everything and focus on myself and the people I am with. I find it interesting the when we were younger we loved being outdoors playing with our friend and now that we are older and have electronics we decide to stay inside because its more entertaining. In conclusion, there are many enjoyable things to do outdoors you just have to find the right activity that suites you or maybe even try new things do to by yourself or find someone to do it with.

There will always be ups and downs to achieving something but even if you fail thats just god seeing how bad you want it, Its like the quote stated by the great Michael Jordan; "" Ive missed over one hundred game winning shots but the ones I did make is because I learned from the ones i missed"", Donald Trump has filed for bankruptcy over 6 times because his business failed But look at him now he is one of the richest business man on earth and hes also the unites states president.

First, People tell stories about successful people everyday and why they are successful, But i bet you there favorite part of that story is what caused them to be successful and thats most likely the failures. i grew up with athletes in my family, so we had a lot of motivation if my older brother can out run me i have to practice so next time we race i can outlast him and thats the beauty of a success story how did they get to that level.

Second, You can hate failure all you want but if you like being successful you have to endure the failure because failure doesnt mean you give up It means your learning, Your gaining knowledge about your goal so on your next try your gonna do better than your last and thats one step closer to reaching your goal.

British Prime Minister Winston Churchill Lost a great war and people hated him but he learned from his mistake and when Adolf Hitler tried to invade the country he came up wit D-day, which defeated the biggest evil dictator this earth has ever seen and people went back to loving Winston.

Fourth, I am not from this country I came here when I was seven I didnt know how to speak English i felt like it was very hard, What motivated me was school i had all these generous people wanting to help me so i tried my best everyday I failed way to many times but i never gave up because i knew that if i learned how to speak English my mom and the people that motivated me would be so happy. I failed multiple times trying to speak English but when i accomplished I looked back and i thought my favorite part about learning English was failing because it pushed me even more to be successful I learned more than just speaking the language i learned to never give up.

Finally,In life there will be obstacles you have to get around to accomplish your goal failure will be a big factor in your path but once you get around failure you would have accomplished and learned what it feels like to fail and never give up, Once you reach your goal you will look back and enjoy the times because success will make you appreciate a lot in life and failure is a lesson not a roadblock.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,2.5,6.0,6.793924331665039,7
906C4B27ECA9,"Should we allow students to use there cellphone at school for educational purposes? To allow cellphone in a learning environment students have to prove them self that they have self control .I think that if the student can show that they have enough self control, they should be allowed to use there cellphones. I also think that cellphone should only be allowed for lessening to music or doing classwork on it.

First, if student can show self control in a learning environment. I think to enforce this rule student have to put they cellphones away every time they enter a classroom. If they don't comply the teacher should be allowed to take the cellphone away until the end of the class. Also if the teacher notices that they have all show self control that they should be allowed to use their cellphones during class to lesson to music. the teacher can also take this away if the class start misbehaving second, some students can't forces unless their lessening to music. I think that they should be allowed to lesson to music when their are doing independent work doing class. Also the teacher should walk around ever once in a wild to make sure that their are doing what they suppose to. Third, if the students are lessening to music they have a less chance to start talking to someone and distracting them.

Finally, if the student are treated like adults they can be prepared for whats out there once they leave school. If the students are treated with respect that they earned they should at least be allowed to lesson to music. Also if the teacher and student can respect each other the class can go much more smother.

2CCFDD86A250,"Be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is a great accomplishment because you can take the opportunity to be a different person and be who are you want to be. not everyone has the opportunity to see the world differently from others , and making you something else there you not really are. For example: lets said that you live with your family and you don't see that nothing is changing ,and they don't give you the opportunity to express yourself or you dont feel uncomfortable. you decide to move to another country and them you see that in the new place is giving you more opportunity them the one you was live in.

Sometimes to be on a world that is trying to make you something else is not always is a great idea because sometime you can start doing bad things no matter if you are a good person or not. there is always going to be one bad side of the world that you can start see it if you do bad things .

like using drugs, killing people,drinking alcohol. or if you have family issues and you don't have nobody to talk about it.

Its kind of good and bad because it depends on the people too if there are trying to see the world different or not , because there are some of them like they don't care much about the world so I say that being yourself on a world that is giving you different opportunity , is helping you to see the different meanings,things that you see that is impossible to do you can see it differently ways and you can take the time to show it to the others.

I think that if you wants to be someone else is depend if you're a positive person or not. And you see yourself being be successful ,and do the things things you want to do no matter what kind of place you are or not it always depends on people how look the world in different ways and act . And the ways you can achievements your goals is doing the right things.

Some students could feel like they dont want to work on that career anymore because it got boring or its not intresting anymore. Also, Students might find another career that got thier attention and would like to work on it more often than last time even if they might not stay long.

It can go and on with finding different careers and then get stuck about which career should they chose and think whats best.

2208E450D536,"I think that failure does have a big roll play in the pursuit of success. Without failure there wouldn't be any success to work hard for. Things would just be easy for peolpe . Im my personal opinion if peolpe were to be so used to having success without having to fail and work hard to get what they want and where they want, life would be plain and simple. life is hard when it comes to setting goals and working for success but at the end of the day all that work, failure and stress are gong to be worth it because you got what you always wanted and worked hard for. For example, if you want something really bad your always going to do the best you can to prusuaed that dream and eventually your going to reach it but before you get it your going to have to fail. failure helps you in a lot of things in how to make your self to keep on trying even though you've failed multipal times now eveything has a prupose and i guess this is failures. Its to see if you give up eventually or if you keep on trying to get what you want no matter how hard and how my you fail before you get to your goal.

The purpose of having failure in your life is to show you how hard you'll have to work to get what you and when you set a goal in your life and try to succed and there's always going to be something that's going to try to stop you from getting there that's were you have to work even harder. when it comes to failing dot give up because it gets hard just keep on trying and you'll see that it willl get better and that eventually you'll have the success that you always disiered.

Never underastimate what you can do because of failure, It's all in your hand's whatever you belive in and think is the best that's all you i just say what i think and in this case you just do what you got to do to succed in life. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,2.5,6.0,5.832683086395264,6
8AB06719AED1,"Having a long vacation break for students is really need it, matter fact from my own opinion our break should be 4 months!, because we work hard to pass our classes. reason why this long vacation thing can help us in different ways most students would be ready for school after a long break, others would feel suprise, and some of us would care so much about school that they wish they was back!. after a long break students would be ready for school and very energized for their new classes, also their favorite teachers!. other students would feel suprise because of their new classmates or old classmates they seen in the pass, they would be fill with joy by seen their old classmates ,and their old teachers. Some students would even have dreams in their sleep wishing they're were back in school already to see their fellow friends and study their favorite classes!.

i disagreed with educators opinion on having 3-4 week of summer vacation this would make the students feel less active in school because they gonna look at it like it isnt fair, most of them gonna be absent most of the main days, and some of them would just skip classes.

by the cause of having only 3-4 weeks of school the education department is going to have many issues on students coming to school. but it isn't a bad idea on adding more breaks during the school year, but others like their school days to be a long streak some students have plans on traveling with their parents to a foreign country, others in jobs that are trying to get paid full hours, and some students feel like staying at home and relaxing from that long school year. but if the educators want to withdraw some months from the summer vacation they going have to make school hours shorter!. this could become to great agreement by shorting the hours in school more students would find positive activities after school! and spent time with their families and also have more hours in their jobs.

I'f educators wanna come to an agreement on shorting the summer vacation, they should appeal a deal with us and we can say to withdraw hours from school days, like make us come around 7:30 and, end school school around 2:15. Students would feel satisfied with this deal and most of them would agreed to this idea i feel like everyone would feel satisfied. One thing educators should add in school actions, are food great delicious food this action would make students come running into school!, food is one thing the wakes up the human body it also knocks you out, but it creates a nice smile in your face. some schools give freedoms to students while their in school and this make students feel more satisfied, and comfortable in school grounds!. i feel like educators should not always be focus on only teaching students but, also on their mood and physical activities. I'f educators establish great changes like this they can also establish their own ideas on what they think about summer vacation breaks.",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,6.0,6.344493389129639,6
D2910C3C8E3B,"I agreed with Auther Ralph Waldo Emerson "" Unless you try to do somthing beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" which is ture. Hard working pays you back!

Some people think they become rich by nature, every time knowledge need to upgrade ,and to keep our wealthy life need to work hard.

First reason, most of the time people think they become rich by nature. Which means they become well to do when they born. I personally do not support this idea because behind every success they is a hard working. For example United State of America is number one powerfull country in the world but, before America got that name their was a lots of scrifice. In my opinion If we dig the ground and we found the piece of gold that is not wealth that is a sign of destination, that means until we got the gold reservoir do not stop excavate.

Second reason, when a year change lots of thing change. For instant knowledge. Now adays tecnology descover the world. In this case every time knowledge need to upgrade. If you have degree in the filed of IT in 2016 and, still you did not upgrade your knowledge you are out of the game. The system or the caricullem is change so fast so we need to ajest our speed to run with the generation. If we need to grow what we have, we need to try somthong.

Inaddition, to keep our wealthy life we need to work hard. For example Bill Gate is wealthy man in America he have everything house,car and money. Bill gate does not say I have everything I do not need to work after this time. He is working hard like us. Because unless he did something to grow his wealth he will going to lose what he have. This is real life by any means if we stop trying we lose everything work, food, money, and family. The key is work hard do not Give Up.

In conclusion, we need to do somthing or try our best to live our wonderfull life. I strongly support Author Ralph Waldo idea. Dreams are not somthing to wait for; they are somthing to work for.

Which means works are the rode to get our dreams. Today is a great day to learn somthing new.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,5.232135772705078,5

A0B8C1FA3811,"I think the students should not be allow to use their cell phone in classroom, the effects of allowing them is not going to be useful comparing to how it will take their attention from their class work to the online world of cell phone. The reasons that most schools have free computer or laptops for all students for educational purposes, and distracting other students, teachers, and the student, who does as well, with out even knowing that .

Most or every school has too many online items for student to use for example, in my school we use laptop and iPad as a main educational resources to do the class work. Using the school resources with free internet, and that allow teachers to know what is everyone doing and help them if they need to. Also, that most schools have a libraries have a lot of the best free educational recourse for all students, so that make students have too many options instead of using their own cell phones in classroom.

Moreover, using cell phone in the classroom would distract others students with their class work for example, I prefer using the outline resource instead of the online once, so I can not focus to my class work when students use their cell phones around me. Also, using cell phone in the classroom could be less useful compare to how it could take students attention to the cell phone Social Medea world or the online world, so if one student didnt use the cell phone in the right way or for an educational purposes all the classroom's people, teacher and students, wold be distract out of their subject and lose their class time.

Others people might have another opinion about that, for example the can say using the cell phone is useful for student for educational purpose and contact family. That can be right when we can be sure that all teenager students would do this. Also that every school has a free phone for students to contact their families if their is a need.

Therefore, using cell phone in the classroom is less use that it's, because that would wast all class's time, and students have more options to search online for their class work.

1510B46771BE,"Why do students like working alone? Although some students may say that working alone is more beneficial. Working in a group pushes student to gain more confidence in themselves, also has more productivity rate than working alone, and students make less mistakes while in a group.

Firstly, working in a group has more productivity than working alone. Every time I and some of my class students have chosen to work in groups we end up finishing first. this example shows when working in a group you can attack multiple parts of the assignment. While in the other hand working alone students have to work in thing at a time showing slower productivity.

Secondly, working alone does not push the students confidence boundaries. When i first started high school i never wanted to work in groups because i was shy and didn't have any confidence. If students can unlock confidence at a young age it will make their life easier and they will have no problem working with others.

Lastly, being in a group makes it efficient for students to spot mistakes they have made. For example every time i've decided to work alone i always made mistakes while the groups didn'r make mistakes. This demonstrates that students that work alone can't check or correct their work because they think they are right. But if students are in groups those students in the group will speak up if they think there's something incorrect.

In the end, I feel that working in groups is better and will benefit students in the long run than working alone. Because by the time they get to the real world students will already know how to work with others and improve their life overall.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,7.0,7.949453830718994,8
3E4B70F8555C,"The benefits of working with a group or working alone. Which do you feel is more beneficial.

In my opinion, I believe working with a group is more beneficial because a group creates different ideas, team work to win the competition, and entertain the audience.

First, each person of the group has a different thoughts and different ideas. They share their ideas to create incurable, different, complete thoughts as a group. Some of the ideas are very difficult to reach the goal, but it is passable to think together and make it happen.

Team work to win the competition is to work together. Each person has to play a different correcter's and roles. Some of them in the group they have to support the main correcter in the stage or back of the stage. Rehearse time to make it inconvenient to be with family members to reach their accomplishment.

Finally, entertaining the audience is most important to each group member. An audience is the people come to enjoy the show, each of the group member are work hard to convince and entertain the audience. Each group member has one leader to follow their roles in specific time to make the show more interact.

I think, the wonderful job can be done working together as a team, developing their ideas and creating entertainment in their performances . And, also, their task is to gives the fans happiness and good time. Team members, families, and teachers will feel proud. I think working with a group it is more joyful.

7C6ED140EF65,"There are many that have responsibility in the world that we have to do and with those responsibility there will be many challenges that we as humans have to overcome to theses things in one way or another. A city council is debating adoption of a 10P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. Dear city council I find it amazing that you are doing this but I also do disagree mainly because. For example, we teenagers have to some activities after school or we have jobs and if its not because of those things its because were stuck in traffic. I do understand the reasoning of why we shouldnt be driving at these hours of the night It's mainly because we're exhausted at that point we can't focus that much. To say something we teenagers we can stay awake much more longer than you adults why do you think we stay up for so long its not because we're bored no its because we want you to see that we can hold our own wait and we stay up for our jobs and dont sleep until we go home when we get home because in truth we can hold ourselves now.

Dear to the city council I actually do think we should have teenagers off the road before 12AM. For example, thats when people that are under the influence are mainly on the road and depending on where you are there could be deer. There are lots of dangerous things in the night that no one can see or even some dangerous people that might harm us in the night. There are a lot of bad things on the road at night and you as the driver could of course from your long drive an turn tired and maybe crash. In conclusion I see why you dont want us to go driving at 10PM or even past midnight because of there being dangerous things in the night but I do also hope that you know that we dont stay up because of random things but we're actually staying up important things like our jobs or after school activities and that we will be very careful in the night because we know of the dangers of the night.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,2.5,6.0,6.7336249351501465,7

So i think the students should have a community service. The principal should required the students to have a community service. If students would decide to have community service they would do a awesome job by helping out residents and helping out the environment because your helping it out by not letting that much trash get in to our world. You would help the plants by letting them grow more and live more. Then will have much more food and vegetables. So i think having a community service is good so will help out the environment to stay clean and have a better and cleaner community. I think those students who say community service takes too much time they should just give some time when they are just sitting their in the couch and go help out your community and the environment.,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,6.0,6.047877311706543,6
2B63A9B12B5B,"Former British Prime Minister Winston once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with this statement because trying to be successful will always come with failures and sometimes you learn from those failures. Failing is not always bad, in matter of fact, failing can help people learn on what they did wrong. Giving up will get people nowhere in life and if people give up they will miss an opportunite on becoming successful.

My first reason is that people don't know that if they choose to take the easy way out on something they failed at and don't try to fix it to be successful, people will start to give up more often the next time they fail. Giving up can also change the characteristics of a person from being a smart person to a doughtful person. Although some people say that giving up is always the best choice when a person is having a hard time on being successful but giving up can also have a bad impact on the person life.

My second reason is that learning from failures to become successful can help improve the person abilities to understand on what he did wrong. Not only does learning from mistakes can help the person improve but can also open many doors in life. Trying to be successful and failing is almost like riding a bike. A kid gets a new bike, he rides it for the first time, he falls on the ground and scraps his knee, he crys and gets angry and then stops and trys to ride the bike again but falls again and then repeats the same steps over and over again until he successful rides the bike without falling.

My third and final reason is that people who never give up on a task that they fail at and become successful the next time they do it again have a better chance to overcome other problems in life. Being successful can give a person a good feeling but can also encourage a person to do more. The more a person resloves a problem the better he or she gets. Being successful can have many benefits in like a better job or a better personality or a better new life. Giving up won't give people happines, it will just give people sadness.

In my conclussion, I agree that giving up is never an option. People need to understand that in order to be successful people need to go throught failures and learn from those failures in order to be successful. Giving up won't help people be successful, it will just help people increase their problems even more. No matter how many times people fail, people who don't give up will always find better ways to fix their failures and learn from their failures in order to improve their problem sovling skills.

C2343290CC89,"Conserving your energy it's an important matter. But you may be wondering why? well, by conserving your energy you will be well rested, healthier and more importantly active, so you can last on your long day of work or in my case school, so I can focus on my learning in order to graduate on time.

Recently, some business companies started to conserve their body energy by working less days, but having long shifts a day. 10 hours a day to be more specific. I personally think that, this is not exactly the right way to conserve your energy and keep your body healthier. On the other hand, I would agree that you would earn more money an have better opportunities in your career despite your personal life.

As far as I understand business companies like Management, Grocery stores, or car dealers have a 8 hour shift Including

Schools and government jobs etc...

If people would work 4 days a week and 10 hours a day It would totally not be good for their healthy and personal life.

First of all, If you work 10 hours a day and 4 days a week you would not have enough time to rest. As a result you would definitely be tired, exhausted and having a bad mood for not getting enough sleep. Second of all, when It comes to your personal life there would not be a family time, and no time to go out with friends therefore, I conclude that the concept of having a 10 hour shift a day would definitely not be that best way to live your life.

In terms of education, specifically talking about schools. Since I'm a student I would not be exited about attending to class for 10 hours a day. Basically because I have responsibilities outside. For example, I have to go to work, study for school and attend to my soccer training during the weekends. Also I would not be able to go work by the time school ends during weekdays and I'm sure there are students like me who have responsibilities to care of outside of school.

Now If I have to attend school for 10 hours a day and 4 days a week I can definitely say that my learning would get affected instead of improving. Nevertheless, I would not able to memorize everything I'm learning in class, because there would be a lot more topics to go over. As a human being my brain and body needs to rest, so I can keep all the information I have learned in class.

In conclusion, whether about going to school or work for 10 hours a day would not be beneficial for your professional and personal life for many reasons. For example, It could affect your health and your emotions which could lead you to be stressed out or having a bad mood not to mention that It could also affect your personal life by not having the necessary time to take care of your responsibilities outside of work.

You learn by the world when you are always doing something you learn how things work like, rationalize yourself, you went through a lot and learn from it, see the world in a different way that other can't see, and it become a way to live, the world makes you be someone different when your always doing something.

By always doing something you deal with everything, deal with life problem, get used to a lot of things,handle problems by receiving help from people that have went through it, received council from all the people around you, also you help people that need a hand, sometimes you can't deal with own problems but you can always find a way to do it and you also can help people with the same issues.

Sometimes its stressful been always doing something but for many people its the best way to get all done and learn from everything you did, make it better, and improve yourself as much as you can.

172F67E7FBBC,"Dear, principal i think that you should not make students do community service to students that don't like doing it. First i want you to know that is a good thing that you thing of that but if students don't want to help and you sent them do something i think they are going to make it worst. EX: you sent them to go pick up trash and they go and they are just playing around they are going to be fighting with the trash throwing it where it was clean then later when they finish playing they are going to see a mess that they are going to get lazy and just walk away and go to another place where its cleaner and if they are trouble makers they are going to do that over and over again.

Think about it if you let students that really want to help out and they do the same thing (throw the trash to each other) and if they really want to help out they are going to clean for them selves. and they are going to be helping because they want to ,not because you forced them to do community service.

I was also thinking of you giving 2 choices

1*students should do community service

2*students get to do extra home work for their hardest classes(where they are almost flunking the class)................ come on unlist think about it.

FF197A6B15B2,"Dear Principal my thoughts about having phone's in school i think you should let students use phone in their own spar time because they don't use it during class and its not fair that most teachers at the school can use them during teaching it is a big distraction when the phone goes off during a test or some important project, but it well help if you let the student use their phone so they can plan their day by letting their parent know where there going after school or other events like school activities like soccer, basketball, and other great stuff the school has provide for all the students.

The big idea about this is trust the students can not use their phone when ever if the students don't follow the rules you can stop phone use but, give it a try and see how well it works out for you but, make you do the right choice or have a vote for the whole school that's how it all work in the U.S. do what's best for your school.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,6.0,5.656688690185547,6

232CDFBFCCC3,"The first reason on why i think we should have healthier school lunch is because it makes you think better. Studies shows that if you eat a healthier meal that your brain will process fast that's why it is important to eat a healthy meal. If more students eat healthier meal that means more learning. Higher grades, and higher test scores. If you get higher test scores your school will be rated on your test score, So not only students be healthy they will also help their school to be the smartest.

The benefit of having healthier food in school is that you will have healthier students, meets number of calories, health benefits, and also promotes healthier living. Their is also effect of eating fast food, America have been choosing fast food as a replacement for classic homemade meals for many of years. It is fast and convenient, but the negative effect outweighed the good effects by a long shot. Eating fast food daily affects students health, diet, leaves a hole in their pocket, and even change their every day mood. The effect might not be seen right away, but after time they will start to add up.

Even though it is going to eliminate some of the students favorite cafeteria foods it is for the good. Eating fast food everyday is not good for your health, for example if you want to play any sport for your school you must be healthy, athletic and energetic. to do all this you must be eating healthy food, it is really going to help the students a lot in their life. students will also get sick if their not controlling their diet properly, parents would want that to happen to their kids. So eating healthy food is better for our school. Many parents want their kids to be health and get knowledge. If our school changes the menu to a healthier lunch parents wouldn't get worried about their kids health.

Many students would not like this idea because their not used to it. Students need to start eating healthy food so that they won't get sick when they get old. If your healthy your brain is going to be healthy that means school isn't going going to be that hard on students. Healthy food isn't that expensive when you compare it with fast food. It will help our school to save more money if we start eating healthy foods in our school. I want my school to be healthy and smart.

SD 1. some student do not like to wake up early and they shoose to take the classes online for the reason that student do not to ride the bus and can early to School.

SD 3. other good reason that is a good idea to take classes in home is that you mom know that you are in home because a lot of students scape and they mom thing that they are inthe School so if peolple attend classes from home mom ready know the his son in home.

Also student can choose the time to they can star the classes,because some students have to work in a job,so when is cold outside and students they don't like to come school,they can wort at home by the way of online or video conferencing,students can be more responseble or maybe not is depent what class of student are you,but the things is there is a lot reasons of benefit for stundents can have that classes.

Some students feel good working at home,there is not streess for them,they can take a break,they can eat and his work. They spend more the energy of his mind etc...

I think the best option for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video coferencing to learn. But also is depent waht classes student do you are,because some student are lazy when they work at home.

Also parent can check his work in look if they do his work good or bad,take classes online is one think like because for me is more aesy to do my homework,so inconclution students have benefit from being able to attend classes from home. ",2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,1.5,2.5,2.0,4.0,4.232638835906982,4

Its not easy to teach them because theres a lot of struggles, anger, they might want to play around with you, you could have a bad day, have a whole different mood the next minute and you might feel like you want to give up.

For an example, working alone trying to teach lions can be very difficult to teach them because your trying the best you can and get it in there minds. It just takes time for them to remember the things they suppost to do like us humans, process everything, and dangerously can get attacked or killed.

also i can do other things not just cashier also i can push carts and i can also help you stock anything around the store and i will always sbe around if you need any help.

i believ that t5hye best job the fits with me or that im interested in is a food and clothhes store like target, walmart and other more i believe im really good at this kinda of job because i have work alot of time and the last job that i had was in a store and i just to get a lot of awards for being a good worker and kind will every single person and also for always having a smile in my face evenb when i wanst feeling good i was not feeling like working but either way i think and believe that store jobs are good for me for what i been told from other people such as parents and strangers.

although many people believe trhat if you work in a store is hard because if a guess ask you a quiestion and you dont know how to answer you have to ask another person that works there too but actually most of the times thatr you work in a store you always have a divice with you which can help see or search wehere a item could be or when someone ask you where they can find something.

other people believe that working in a store with food and clothes is easy because they been working there their whole life or alot of years but i agree with this because i believe that the most you stay in a job you learn more, also my parents and friends have always tell me that i am a hard worker and i never give up on somehting i really want or need which motivates me to do more good at my job or would help me do good in my future job, i believe im a good hard working student and that i would do really good at this kinda job.

in my opinion i believ that a store part time for students would be really good because i believe that if you work in a store it wouldnt be that hard because most of the things people or you need you can look it up on the divice you have on you, so it would be really easy if you looking for something and you cant find it although theres some of the items that dont come up on a the device so you have to look for them in another store and price match which you can do at anytime.

in Conclution the best job that interests me is a store job because thats what i been working since my first job so i believe that i would do really good working there and would be really nice to guesses at all times even when im sick,",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,5.0,5.214691638946533,5
83C48C5697AE,"Living in a place with frequentely hihgest demand to provide my best, is one the must important achievement. I agree with Emerson statement because with the individuality we can reach all our goals.

It is to important for me to recognize that i have to get my goals with effort. Because this help to provide, work hard, competition, and bocome the best .Individuality is a good factor to trust in my self to be the best because help us to look for option that help our lifes

.Working by my self make me work hard. when a person work by his own company he try to do a great work fixing everything it is the such as work alone, if you work alone yo going to do a perfect job to impresione others labors .For example, when i work without partner, i try to do a great gob to be one on the best workers. When i do my own work i feel excite cause, i could receive an award for be a good producer. everybody want to be award for their job so everrybody wish a reward. But to be award we have to hsave capacity in the jobs Many person due the same thing like me cause doing my the own work provide a big result. So working by my self make an emotion to work hard and to increase the amoung. Consequently to do a individual work make a good results. Doing own projects workers show more production In the factory and result good Therefore this help to get alot resources by workers.

Competiton is a ways to decrease the teamwork. individual competition is a big example of overcome. Examples could be when a person start to work in his job and start to recieve more money because the person is doing a great work ,this make that others poerson get mad so in the factory start the competition cause everyone want to recieve more money and they thick is unfair be reciving the same amoung of money so they start to argued why the manager give more money to the new guy but the thing is that he has a good specialization in the job. concecuently Many time the work competition provide a good production in the factory so, everyone want to get their goals like a good amount of products also,big accomplishment occur with the worker is trying to find a new way to get more product than other. For example, when a worker finished his assignment could receive free time,this make feel angry other workers so , they are going to try to look for others forms to produce more than the winner because, they want to receive the same reward for the production . To do a good competition the work have to be alone to and with big group people. competition is a good way for individuality work to provide a emotional affect. In many companies the owners look for a way that workers produces a lot and they offer money or free time to the person that make more products .as result, being in a factory with many labors working seperated make a big impact where everyone want to procud the most materials. Therefore,challenge could be a a good idea for separated jobs .

Looking for an accomplishment to become the best. Every one in this life want to have something to be recognize in this world althogh,to be a succefull person we have to work hard. Not matters what tell about us such as critique,bullying ,etc. The only thing that is important for us who we are. So the best thing that could can happens in our life is be a place where frecuently we are demand to do different things. Although with many problem we have to be patience and support all bad things. Because,if we wish to be different than the rest of persons and realize our goals. thought must be working by our selves. Because sometimes nobody is with us to provide help. fighting by my self i could be a big man in the socierity. Currently in the world we have many competition one example can be soccer,almost the majority look in the tv .Soccer is a game where a team have 24 for player. They have to compite who is the leader in the team. So like in the real life the leader is the person that work hard,help the other players .Otherwise, could be a leader in a company, to be the leader of a company ,the leader had to compite with other person that wanted to become a big leader ..Therefore to be a person succesfull have to take individual decision .

Being in a world where have to take decision and concern about goals is the best thing that we can have to show our capacity. Doing my own job make me put effort and dedication. Work in gruop is affect by bet. Being a different person than others. The person that different quality could be someone that can help. Because, this kind of person make the differences in the world trying to win in a place where the competition and the demand are in high level ,so they try to have imfluences in the in their jobs. The individuaity help alot in the world to be a succesful place. For example in the govermen there are many people with a big level to compite with other this, that means it i s has a great achievement in the government,so i agree with Emerson statement cause the competition provide good benifit for us and too the progress of the government,factory,countries,therefore being a part with competiton meke us to improve our best",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,6.0,4.678647041320801,5
812DF001F32B,"It is amazing how everything in the world is changing. The most interesting thing to watch changing for me is technology. It has grown and changed a lot in just past 10 years. For example, right now you dont even have to leave your house in order to get some food. It is not just changing it self, but it also changing us and our lives. We dont even realize how much technology has helped us in our lives. Limitation of human contact due to use of technology has positive effect on peoples lives because it made it easier, comfortable, and very interesting.

Technology have made our lives much easier. We are using technology every day as a helpful equipment and source. It really have changed the way we live, work, and rest. Right now instead of going to library and looking through 100 books to find and answer, you can find it in 2 minutes not even moving and asking anyone for help. In our time you dont even need to feel uncomfortable in front of a girl while asking her on the date. It is much easier to just send her a text.

It is also very comfortable. Technology made us feel comfortable and our work to be comfortable. Sometimes theres things that we cant say to persons face but technology made that better by letting us just sand an email to that person. Technology had made and awesome impact on our lives. Also it is comfortable in transportation. For example a cell phone, it is very small but it does a lot for us.

Lastly, technology is very interesting thing. It can also do a lot of different things for us. It can tell us what other people cant tell us. People can only teach us what they know, but technology can teach us anything that we want to learn. It is a great way to learn new things because technology always gives you a full explanation but people dont.

In conclusion, technology really has a positive effect on peoples lives because it made it more interesting, comfortable and easier. If you cant find an answer with a person you can always find id with technology. You dont need to talking to anyone to find an answer anymore. It really have changed our lives in a better way.

707127A44212,"The school board plans to put a extra one and a half hours to each school day but as a student i highly disagree for multiple reason regarding it, people would get stressed out,what would you do with the extra time,and you'll possibly be more tired,

My first reason is simple really most teachers and students just want to go home after there long day at school but adding one and a half hours to each day would most likely make every one in the district pretty stressed out, since they won't be able to go home one the usual time and some parents might even feel stressed as there kid(s) are still in school and not home with them where they can spend time together.

Reason two is the fact what are teachers going to do with the extra time most teachers just plan work for the amount of time each class time is but adding extra time is pretty hard since they won't know what to do with the extra time on there hands so a every day old school day is better since it's already been planed out but adding that extra time just wouldn't work regardless since again what will you do with that extra time.

The last reason but certainly not least is everyone would most likely be very tired after the long school day they just had but it's not good since students with homework would most likely forget since there mind is pretty much telling them to get some rest over doing there homework which would likely cause grade A students to become pretty mediocre and would most likely start to fail classes since the extra time would tire some people out but a usual school day won't tire them out since it's the time there used too and grade A students would stay grade A students and students who need improvement will and most likely i'm prove.

Overall keeping a school day short but educational is still good than just having extra time because students and teachers would lose there benefits of being with family and having a calm mind which only regular school days give. While a extended school day would possibly make people lose some family time and give them stressed minds over calm minds. So overall regular school days are better than a extended one.

D30D6D7F3D39,"Some teachers think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. I feel that working together would be more helpful for all students because they can share more ideas, have less work and can be working with less stress.

Students can have a little conversation for get more information, then they can pick one or more ideas for make their work more easy . They can argue from each idea that could be more important. Every students have different thoughts that can help them to realize a good work. For example, When I was in my country my teacher said that we can choose work together or alone, and I prefer to work alone because I thought that working alone was more beneficial for me but I was really confused about it. Working together help us to know different option and students can have more social communication.

Working together imply to have less work. Students can be take more opportunities for learn new thing everyday, also that can help teachers too. Less work can be helpful for a lot students because they can realize missing work, extra work and other activities during class. Furthermore, I remember when I was in 6 grade my teacher said that ''less work can help you to have more time for you'' that means that sometimes with less work teachers and students could learn and have more progress.

Some classes can be stressful for a many students because teachers need to realize all activities during their classes and sometime students do not understand what they need to do. Otherwise, working together would be more easy for students to finish their work quickly. One important fact in my life that

I never forgot is when my English teacher said that we have just 10 minutes for take the exam, and everyone fail because he was very strict with us. Working with another person have a lot benefits for reduce stress. Students can help each other and check their own work .

In conclusion, Working together could be very helpful for many students who need help for get better grades during the year. All students prefer to work with people who has different option, ideas and new thing that help them. They can have more time for make missing work or do homework during class. Working together would be more beneficial for all students.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,7.0,6.534106254577637,7

134937CE445C,"""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.""

Introverts can easly feel identificated with Waldo's words, in a world where the majority goes in the same diretion trying to convince themslves that the way they are taking is the best, it is just a fantacy, but sadly unique, and genius people are afected by the same.

As time passes most of us we still refusing to be like the rest of society; I trully belive that being yourself is more importar than a life lacked of happiness.

As we growing up we been told how to be, and who we have to be like, but only people who resists and face world's opinion can really know deeply what self-acceptation is. It is not about ego, it is about reallity. God, Universe or whowever gave us life, also gave us a purpose. Being different is not a crime, but a privilege, so we have to take advantage of it. Life has a lot of perspectives, just because they are right, does not mean I am wrong.

Before my favorite artist passed away, he used to say: ""I rather to be hated for who I am, than be loved for who I am not."" well, I think Emerson would love this quote.

In most of the cases they end up being rejected, just because how they look, how they dress or how they think. but it is a fact that no long they become the most greatness, successfull and happiest people in the world, and there is a few of them. well, I guess no pain, no gain.

I know is hard to be yourself when all these people are judging, in my opinion it is a really big accomplishment being yourself, even in these modern times. I never understood why we have to be like someone else just to be accepted in this cruel society but I know for fact that being myself is the best feeling I've ever felt, so I trully believe that being yourself is more important than a life lacked of happiness.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,6.0,6.273306846618652,6

BAD99FB704BB,"Is honesty always the best policy?

An old proverb says honesty is the best policy. sometimes, however, honesty might get really bad effects.

honesty is a good characteristic , if the the situation is very serious or you and yours friends did something really bad , you need to be honest and speak the true, but sometimes honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in little troubles.

Honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings. For example ,one of Generic_Name's friends tells her something and ask Generic_Name to keep it a secret,

the next day someone is trying to persuade her to say her friend's secret out loud and she just reply by saying, "" what secret are you talking about? , my friend didn't tell me a secret or something like that."" she did the right thing by laying because if she would not lied about it ,

the friend that asked her to keep the secret would feel upset and nobody else is going to trust Generic_Name. Another example is that if your friend ask you if she looks good in a certain outfit , however, that is not your style and you don't like it at all , the best thing to do is to say that you like the outfit, if you tell her this , you will not hurt your friend's feelings.

One more reason of why honesty is not always the best policy is that you or people around you might get in trouble. For example , If you and your sister ate something that your mom left in the fridge while saying "" I am going to work and when I come back , I will eat this."" when your mom arrives home, you tell her that you and your sister didn't heard when she say that she will eat it later on. This way , you and your sister will not get in trouble , however , you know that it was just a white lie and that if you do something serious the next time , you need to be honest and tell her the true.

In conclusion , honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in trouble, however, there are many situations in where you need to be honest and speak the true.    ",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,2.5,3.0,7.0,7.143967151641846,7

33F18D5D8867,"Would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home help then not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by students getting to much school work that cannot all handled in one night. Everyday kids complain about having to much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Students being educated at home gain more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Learning at home and not at school helps kids to succeed and have better grades. No only does learning at home provide less distraction, it provides students with flexible schedule.

First, Students complain about having to much homework because students who spend a lot of time on their homework and don't have enough free time for them to relax is considered having to much homework. When they get out school and they have to practice some sports them they have to go to their house just to eat and them to do their homework, they cannot spend time with their family. Homework can limit the time. Students can spend with their friends, family, or other activities they can do. Too much homework can also give students more pressure from parents interference, this may cause unhealthy amount of stress. This is why students prefer home school.

Second, One of the best things about home school is that It can be done at anytime because It can be done at any time, children have a flexible time schedule with mean that the parents can helps. The student can work around schedule instead of the parent working around the students schedule. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. Home schools allow students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Another thing about homeschooling is that there are not rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules, the students can focus on their studies.

Third, when you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are may distraction that can make students loss focus on what there are doing. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit student. Learning from home won't have the distraction that that a classroom has. As a result of this, student won't loss focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. One of the reason students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment they are no familiar with, which makes then feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. In a school, you are stuck at desk for 6 hours and have limit time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. This does not helps students at all. In conclusion, the environment at home will benefit student's by giving them better grades.

In conclusion, Students should be offered classes online because the environment is less stressful, which could benefit test scores. At home there is less distractions, rather than at school where are many different things to worry about. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. Many students successfully take some, and even all, classes from home. School systems and all districts should offer distance learning. ",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,9.0,8.049760818481445,8
83F57096AF9C,"Be a master in any area is something really awesome, because you already have experience and you already know what are you doing. There is positive and negative things for being a master.

In my opinion

I disagree with Emerson becasue even if you are a master in an specific area you never stop growing, everyday you learn more about your mistakes and about life and how to live a good one, also you learn something new that helps you in all types of areas that you have in your life.

However in this world there will be someone that will disagree with your opinion, because they have different type of mentality,or they think in a different way.

If you have a goal you never need to stop growing on it, becasue is something that you really want for your future and you want to do that for the rest of your life. That is why you need to choose carefully what do you want, because maybe in the future you can regret and that is a bad thing that you can erase,becasue you feel frustrate because you spend a lot of time on something that you didn't like.

Being an expert in an area is something really important, the positive things for being a master is that:

You domain your area and nobody needs to command you.

You can do the things easily and quickly.

You are an expert in what are you doing, so you are exited.

Is more easier to get good things, something that benefits you.

You can get great jobs with a good payment.

You can be also your own boss or manager.

There is also negative things for being a master:

There are many people that they are an expert in any area

You need to compet with your rival

You need to try to be the best

If you have a business and you are making some mistakes you need to fix it quickly because it can affect to your own skills.

In conclusion

I disagree with Emerson, becasue you can still growing even if you are making a lot of mistakes, you can still achieve new things,you need to grow in person and in skills,always.

916C937AF222,"Arts are important in everyone's life. it helps to take out the negative energy from the body and to be positive. If it is drama, music, or art, they help us to show our feelings without saying it. Also arts mean talents. It is required to take arts class, isn't it? In my opinion, it should be required to take class in arts because some students need to know their talent, students need to know how important is arts, and when the students know their talents, it may change their life.

First, there are many people don't know their talent, and may be they don't know that they have talents. When they look at art or drama, they feel that it is so hard to do, and they can't do like that, but it is not true at all. For example, if I saw a beautiful draw, I think that only the professional artist can do that, but when I watch him from the beginning,step by step, I feel that I could do like that. Always, when we meet with artist or musician, we feel that they are quiet and spread a positive energy to the people because they are looking to the world in different position. So we need to know our talent to do something we love and to be positive. Moreover, we need to know how important are the arts. If we guess the world without any kind of arts, it will be looks boring. For example, the drama now is very important in everyone's life; I think that there is no home without television or you tube or net flex. The same thing without art; it won't be museums, fantastic buildings, or any kind of designing. Even photography, without it we will not have memories with our friends and family. The very important thing is that every separate person can do his talent in a different way than any one else. For example, in photography every photographer have his own angle and themes which take the attention of people to it. So these arts are very important in our life, and we can't guess the world without it.

Some can say that the importance of the regular classes is more than these arts specially the students who have early graduation or whom taking AP classes. However, when they discover their talents, they sometimes change their position. For example, my friend was want to be an engineer because math is his favorite subject, but when he toke a photography class, and he discovered his talent in photography, he changed his mind to be a photographer and to work in that position. Another example, I knew someone who finish his collage, but he was love drama, so after collage he left his work to work in drama, and now he is very famous author in drama.

In conclusion, high schools should require the students to take a class on the arts because every person have a talent in arts and need to discover it and use it, every person need to know how important is his talent and how it can change the world, and knowing our talents can lead us to change in our life and our feature jobs. So the arts are make us positive.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,8.0,6.418615341186523,6

The change of the menu at the cafeteria might be a good idea but also might be a bad idea for some students, the idea to have a new menu at the cafeteria should be made it first in a debate with all the students at the auditorium, students can have the right to vote if they would like to have a new menu at the cafeteria, they might give a vote for which kind of food can be remove and which kind of food should to stay, or they can decide if will be better to not make a change at the cafeteria, making this plan will not have any impact in students or school to choose they food or making a change because they will have the opportunity to decide what is good and what is not good for them.

Making this plan, students will feel comfortable to decide good things for their school, students can also share ideas with you and make different plans for a good change at the cafeteria, just think about it and you will see good results in students of your school.

If students decide to have a different menu of food...

""This might be a great idea for student to try different kind of food and make this change every year, the good thing about making this is that student will not feel tired for be eating the same kind of food every year.""

""Students will feel excited every day to go to the cafeteria and see the new menu of food at the cafeteria.""

""Some students might have a favorite food but they can try different varieties of food and have new favorite food.""

""Also will be a great idea to give 35 minutes of lunch instead of 25 minutes, students can share time with them friends, have more time to finish if they have any work class or homework to do.""

""Students can enjoy the free time to eat with no rush. Making a change will be an idea that all might students they'll support it."",

I hope you consider this idea as a good idea and students may consider it this as a good idea too, also think about the good change that you can make for students to have better time at school and enjoying they lunch will be great to fill they energy and get back to class.

In the futerch there will be more acts of kindness that way we can be happy with one another

I hope that I am right about there being more acts of kindness ,but there are not a lot of people who do acts of kindness. I feel that people should do more acts of kindness. If you have time go to a nursing home and bring flowers to the elderly women. You can make a now friend by doing something kind ,or by just being nines to them. We all have to do something for a act of kindness also by doing something like that you feel better about your self before you help someone. Make your friend happy by doing something kind for them because you never know what they are going though. You also never know what someone else is going though ether.

I think what the Greek storyteller Aesop is trying to say is just be kind to people. Doing a act of kindness can make someone happy if they had a bad day. For Example,if you help them water there plants you can make them happy. A good way to do a act of kindness is by helping your mom Cooke diner another way you can help is by doing something you don't have to be asked to do. We all have those day were it is just a bad one and you dont want to do any thing well if someone does something for you with them not knowing you had a bad day at school or at work. there should be more people to do something kind to other people.

For Example, it a trash day were it came later then before me, and my step brother had to take the trash done to the side of the road. Will there was elderly layde that was outside when i was outside. in the place

EE58A33AD551,"In my opinion, I gree with the Prime Minister Winston Churchill because the enthusiasm in the life is everything because without the entusiasm we are nothing, we can't go nowhere because we don't has the enthusiam, if we want something like jod, career, something the we want in life, we need the enthusiams first. Failure make people to give up when they mess up something but they has to keep going and doing thing possitive. Now i going to writting some example and information about the enthusiams and failure.

First, In this life if we not make a mistake (failure) we are not going to learn anything but we has to know if we fail we always has to try again and again no better what. We always need to thing possitive and has the enthusiams to do it again and get what ever we want in this life but always with the enthusiams because we need to has enthusiams to try again. Don't drop out your dreams if thing not going well.

Second, we need the enthusiams in our lifes no better if we failure, the enthusimas is the impulse to keep going and get everything like finish high schools, past the test, has a good grade but first thing possite and be enthusiams in things you really want to be successful in the future.

Third, the enthusiam is a great enjoyment, interest or approval . I think everyone has interest in something and we can make it, we can has everything but if propose in life. For me, my enthusiams is graduate from high school to make mother proud of me because thats why she came to United State to give me a better future and now she enthusiams to see her daugther graduate from high schools.

Addition, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" in this quote said failure to failure is an instance of something not functioning properly but is not mean to give up just doing again but never loss enthusiasm to thing you love or want in the future just keep going make yourself proud of you and but never lost the entusiasm you has for things you love just because people talk bad things or thing is not good well, life give lesson to see if we are strong. Enthusiasm is everything in life.

conclusion, I will said that Minister Winston Churchill is rigth because how i said in the beginning of my first paragraphs enthusiams is everything in life, we need to has enthusiams in everything we do to make it better. Failure sometimes make persons to stay in the same place, failure don't let people to keep going because they think everything they do is failure and never try again or be unsuccessful in achieving something.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,6.0,5.046085834503174,5

Back in his country, he had a dream to become a lawyer, and in school he was the most polite and the hard working student. In the school that he goes to in America, he has become the most laziest student and stubborn who could not get done his classwork neither his homework. Generic_Name hangs out with lazy people in America as a result he has became one of them too. The movement of ones person can force him/her to adopt other people's character traits.

Secondly, an individual's character traits are formed by influences beyond his/her own control such as social situations. For example, to convince my mom that I want a new phone, I have to show her that I deserve it. Two days ago I told my mom that I want the new iPhone 12. She said that it is too expensive and that i am not worth it. I insisted on getting the phone so I explained everything that I do at home and that I always have good grades at school. And finally when I said that she accepted to buy me the new iPhone that I want. People mostly change who they are when they want to gain something and for a fact this is a situation that a person cannot control.

Some people may argue that individuals choose their own character traits. Choosing your own character is true; however, a person's character traits is formed by influences beyond his/her own control as an environment. Even though people decide their own character traits. A person cannot change the way they were born.

In conclusion, sometimes people fail control or change the way they were born because they rely on what others do. First, moving from place to place forces you to change and also finding yourself in a social situation can make you to act different than yourself. Those who argue that they choose their own character traits may be right; however, everyone mostly leave close to people they want to be like. The way we were born is not to be controlled by a person because that's what makes us who we are.",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,9.0,7.657474517822266,8
A0A56F7995D6,"I disagree with the statement about a positive attitude is the key to success in life because there's others things you need to be success in life anyone can have a positive attitude and they are not success or probably won't be, theres only few percent of people in this world that are success there are some people that dont have a positive attitude and they are success in life.

For example people with a positive attitude they try so hard to be success in life but they cant they keep trying, trying and nothing happens. now some people with a bad attitude are success they dont even have to try to work hard to be success.

Image how many people work hard and hard every day just be success in life, but theres a couple of people that have a positive attitude and they are success in life basically living life great, there are people people that dont have a positive attitude they just do bad things to be success. now doing bad things is not right because you can be success for a while. for example it can be stealing or drugs if you are dong those things you will be success but is not a right choice for you and you keep doing it one day you will have to pay for what you did, most people prefer to work hard every day to be able to have at least everything, I prefer people to do the right thing because doing bad is not going to get you anywhere you might be success but it wont be forever id rather work hard so i can be success in life ",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,5.0,5.3624372482299805,5
9E96EB0152A6,"I feel that this learning program can hep younger and older students and have a very big a effect on the people involved in the program, that is taking place in the schools.

Not many many other schools have this program to get extra help and kids need to understand that the there is a big opportunity that is being given to them and they need to take it.

This program helps the younger students get a opportunity to get better at something that they are having a hard time on inside of school.

If the kids are having a hard time on doing work at home or not understanding, they dont have to get worried about there grades dropping because there are other options that you can do.

If the younger kids parents do not have that much time to sit and help them with work, then they can just get help from the learning program that happens at there school.

The more you go to the meetings the better you will get even if it takes time.

I also feel that this could be important to the older kids that help as well.

This program would do very good for their service hours for there service hours for school.

It must be a good feeling for them because they were chosen to do something they are good and smart at.

They could possibly put this program on there college resume if they would like to become a teacher when they grow up.

There are many other reasons that this program could be helpful to others.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,7.0,7.0226945877075195,7
061AD4A149E6,"author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment

Do you agree or disagree with emerson's statements about individuality ?take a positionon this issue support your response with reason and specific we live in a world designed in a way to Maine us all out as followers. Due to the internet anyone can talk to anyone or know anything they want,yet along with it we have thing like media which always shows people in their ideal and promotes only certain ideas because of this, people all end up acting similar to what they see online or in TV a day and age where they have all the freedom they can imagine at their fingertips. Based off a quote by the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson, it is those who able to remain individual that are the most impressive .progresses,Since we have the option to have more and more individuality, yet we all seem draw to the few ideals based off what others think of you in the past decade social media has grown to became of the most reliant forms of communication an gaining information through various social media platforms ,individuals can be ins pirated to create personality and style that is their own allowing people to present themselves in a way that exceeds the social norms has become such a fad in the past years that others have been ins pirated to do the same,thus creating a world of individuality. No matter what the topic whet ether it be extravagant make-up designs or gay rights there are trending topic or nearly every platform and whether or not and individual decides to look at it .Their will always be inspirations from that one main topic .it is a great accomplishment to learn the breaking from the exaggerated limits of society and to be free fromwhat is expected social media also enables individuals to export his or her ideas and interest to the public it is open door for people to expresses their true self. Throughout my experience, I enjoy positing pictures on social media apps such as Intagram and Facebook that show how i am .Due to societal expectations and peer pressure, people are limited to express their personalities .social media allow my voice to be heard and not silences however it also take personal courage and determination to post different ideas for the entire world to be see. Therefore ,i agree with emerson's quote that being yourself is the greatest accomplishment because people need to be brave in order to expose themselves to society's criticism .

social media it all easy to spread an ideas without saying a word .spending most our time in a atmosphere like this we aren't granted a personality out of anyone real or fake .I've found that on my personal account it's easy to base a good post myself has never been necessary in my greed for the attention all i have to do is post a picture in the same vibes of any tumbler account ever created .A

tumblr to and artist is make-up to guru, flashy clothing to stylist ,or drag race to a wannabe comedian deciding to express my oppinions or writen anything at all is merely and afterthought this observations this observations alone burns emerson's quote in the angst filled fire that social media is those turned away from social media are usually equipped with more more life experience (being older ) disagreeing with emerson could I've found that personal feelings or mental status remain separated from their career, and fell they have conquered much bigger thing than being themselves others may be societal norms that the rest of the world either push towards or run away from; the way they are suits their positions perfectly

So in conclusion we do agree that people should be themselves and that anyone should have their own individually . Individuality is what reflects and individual's interest and trait social media are why some people are their own person or have their own individuality social media can create a person's style. Being yourself can help you speak up for yourself an be your own person . Also the internet is another big reason to agree with emerson's quote too . Not caring what think or having your own particular is the least part.  ",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,5.0,6.5192413330078125,7
8E53C7642922,"Have you ever group up with older or younger students before? And you think of eachother's differently and won't work it out, well there a program that helps older and younger to solve that problem.

Older students can teaches the younger students to learn the next year problems or tests that is coming up. The younger students would confuses how do the problems infront of them and would need helps. The older students help the younger students with their studies. Older students can help them read the sentences on the problems they have or help with the steps of the problem. The younger students can help the older students what they learned and teach them how the problems works again. A lot of older students forgot what they learned in the past and it's stressful. In sixth grade, my teacher let's all sixth grades read with 2nd graders and it's how younger and older bonds little bit.

The younger and older students can bond eachother in the program. They can learn from eachother what they do in their own grades to lighten up the day without awkwardness. It's a teamwork program that helps younger and older students to assist for eachother. It's like a group project and they have to work with eachother to finish the project and helps eachother step by step. One time i was little a older student alway read to me and slowly we bonded, It's was nice at the end of the day.

F2BDB9DFFB57,"Some schools decide attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing, and the students can learning from them homes.

In my personal opinion, I think the option of some schools choose to take some classes online that is not a good idea because not all the students are going to do all the things if they are need to graduated with a good grades of the school, however is a good option because no all the students have the same opportunity to study here in the school or in home but have the possibility to study and do the school with all classes with needed, but is mostly depending of the students who wants take the classes online, because I think is more easy when someone explain the class for you, and you can understand all the things and do a good job.

But in the actuality no all the students have the same opportunity to came to school every day so all the students are going to do benefit because someones needs to work and support yourself, but if can do the classes online that's better for the students who don't have to much time to stay in the school, so now they have the opportunity to learning and watch some video conferencing online and they can finished the school online from home, however I think the students have the last decision to do, or not the classes online. In my opinion I think is better if we came to school and take the classes with us, because when we have some problems or questions, they can explain and help to understand more some things, but if we have the option to do the classes by way online I think no all the students are going to take too much time to do the classes.

For example I have one friend who came to school every single day, he do all of his work and he learn more because he doesn't have a job he have the possibility to study and get a good grades, he have more time to support in school, but if he get a job he is going to be tired most in the days in school, he are was to change is main about the school.

And other example, if a can change my classes and do online, honesty I don't want to do online my classes because I don't like the school a lot, I know I don't came to much to school because I need money to support my self, that's why I don't came to school too much and other thing i don't like the school is the language is difficult but i tried every single day to be better, and this is my last year of school, so I do everything I can to do this year better, and my opinion I never want to do my classes online I think the teachers are for helping and do the best they can for all the students. I am not agree with the schools teachers who have the idea to do the classes online because is more important the education for all the students, therefor the students improve the study in school more when we came to school and do the work.

In my conclusion I think the student have the last decision if they want to do the classes online or not ,I think is better if all the students came to school and they take all the classes with the teachers here in the school and the teachers can helping the students can learn more things that they are know, also thats better because you can distract and do a better job every day, and we can get a more education.

C37F09E24836,"In some School's not only do teacher's assist student's but now student's beginning do the same for younger one's at School. Some School's have program's that teacher's allow student's to pair up with younger one's at the Elementary School's. In this program student's do game's read book's and so much more exiting activities. They do this to help out younger students that are just beginning school and are scared and don't know what to do in School or how to react because of their first time being in School. The older student's assist out the younger one's on how to read, comprehend and to get the understanding of how books are read and what they could be used for in their future life, this is the reason older students are so helpful and useful.

Another amazing this program is useful is because for those student's that are home alone and have no older brother's or sister's, this program helps them get a understanding of how it feels having sibling's at home. This program entertains and not only that but also influence's younger student's on how it feels having a sibling at home and the amazing time spend with each other as well. I think this is a wonderful and interesting idea because it interests kids and makes them want to return to School and love School if they are having second thoughts about School, for example if they do not like it and don't want to return, having a buddy might want to change their mind because they can only imagine the fun and exiting time they can have with their buddy!

Teachers's, Principal's and other member's like the School bored did a smart plan of creating this fantastic program of older student's assisting out the younger student's and teaching them a thing or two about certain things. Younger student's look up to the older student's and the older student's are known as role models because they are much more mature and that is why younger ones look up to them. The reason why this program is helpful for both younger and older student's is because this program impacts both younger and older student's, it impacts the younger ones because it teaches them how to read and write and it impacts the older student's because they learn how to assist younger ones and how to communicate with them. This great program will help out student's right now in class and also they will learn how to use these skills in a daily life and maybe on their everyday lifestyle and job's.

When a student or any person assist out another, at the end they will always feel proud about their self's and they will want to keep on helping others in their daily life. That is why they might have this program so student's can get the feeling of how it feels helping out someone and so the younger student's can learn how to read and get the feeling of how it the sensation would feel if they had sibling's at home. They might fight but at the end they will later then respect each other and they will learn how to communicate with each other. School is important because student's learn from their mistakes and then next time the same problems happen to them they will learn from it and make it better then the first time. They learn and learn so when a student is a fully grown adult they know what is expected of them and how to assist other's if needed also they will be more mature and will know how to act. if someone is out their struggling or having a difficulty time doing something, the adult that was ones a students and helped out younger student's will automatically know what to do and how to help the one's that will need help. This is the reason this program is so helpful and I hope they keep having these things for student's in the past and will continue to help them in the future.",3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,7.0,6.127012729644775,6

I think you should let us bring our cell phones to school.

Then we could only use them during break and lunch.

First, if the teacher catch the students using their phone in the classroom they will tell the principal and he will take it away.

Next, their parents have to come to the school and pick it up four them.

4B0CF2CFCB4A,"Should people follow their own instincts, or should they follow other people step?

If people seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters they would not fail in life; however, people should make their own decisions. People should make their own decisions because they can define their self, follow their instincts, and get experience through the life.

First, people should make their own decision because they can define their self. Every single person should make a difference on the world. For example, I do not like to be guide for others person, I like to be different than every one else, try new things, and have my own ideas. Also, around the world are many people that are known for define their personality and for try to change the world with their ideas. Barack Obama is one of them, he was known for his humanity and his charismatic. Every person was made it to perform extraordinary different decisions. People should make their own decisions because they can define their self.

Next, people should make their own decisions because they can follow their instincts. Many times ours instinct are right, but sometimes we let others person tell as what to do, therefore we fail. For example, when we are taking a test and we make cheating,

we fail the test because we not even like to try and follow our instincts. When I have to take a test and I do not know much about the test, I just follow my instincts and at the end, I got good result because is not necessary to do what others persons do. Is more about what you believe that is the best. There is not major accomplishment than do your best, to believe on your-self. People should make their own decisions because they can follow their instincts.

Finally, people should make their own decisions because they can get experience through the life. When a person make their owns decision do not matters if they are successful, or if they fail. Because at the end they learned how it was it and how to do next time. But if they never try, they never would know how hard, or easily is achieve something. For example, last year I fail all my SOL because an friend told me that he pass it all his SOL and was easily.

He suppose to be a expert, so I truth he. But was not tru and I learned that is better try by my self. now I capable to give advice to anthers students and help them. If I never had make my own decisions, I would never get experience. People should make their own decisions because they can get experience through the life.

In conclusion, people should make their own decisions because they can define their self, follow their instincts, and get experience. Every person should make the difference on the World and express their own ideas. When people follow their instincts we accomplish good result. Also, when people got experience through the life following their instinct they could be successful and are capable to advice other people.

89114CEF532E,"What is one type of job you would like to employ and why would you would you employ it ? The one job i would employ would be a soldier. The one type of work I would employ would be a soldier because it has a lot of money and I want to protect people in the country.

First of all the one type of job I would employ would be a soldier because it has a lot of money.

For example, There was a boy named Generic_Name .Generic_Name was in high school and he was in tenth grade .Generic_Name wanted to be a nurse but his parent didn't want him to be a nurse because they knew that nurse didn't have a lot of money. Generic_Name also wanted to become rich so he could help his family. But Generic_Name dreamed so little for himself. Generic_Name hated when his parent told him that he was not going to be a nurse. When he went to school the next day , he told his friend what his parent told him. Generic_Name friend also knew that being a nurse would not help Generic_Name so he decided to tell him the truth.``Generic_Name maybe your parents are right."", He said.`` Isn't nurse a good job too?,"" Generic_Name asked.``It is , It's just that being a nurse is no good for you and your parents,"" He said.``Why,"" Asked Generic_Name .``Because it doesn't have enough money for you and your parents,"" He said. When Generic_Name went home ,he started thinking maybe his friend was right . He took a lot of time thinking about it. So he decided to be a soldier. At first he didn't want a soldier then he thought about it and he decided to go to soldier school. When he was graduated he went to collage. He worked really hard. When he finished his school,he employed for the soldier work. The first thing they did they buy a new house for him. When he started to work there he didn't have any problems .He felt like his dreams came true. He never had any money problems. And he also had enough money to help his parent. His parent were really proud of their son and happy for him. From there on he didn't have any money problems .

In addition

The one type of job I would employ would be a soldier because

I want to protect people in the country.

Once there was a girl named Generic_Name .Generic_Name lived with his father and mother but she didn't have any siblings. Generic_Name

Generic_Name 's father was a soldier .Generic_Name really loved being a soldier but her parent didn't let her be because in their country girls weren't allowed to fight on wars. One day a soldier came to Generic_Name 's home and told Generic_Name's father that there was war in their town so they needed him. But Generic_Name father couldn't go because he was really sick .And the problem was he only had one child and she was girl. Generic_Name's father wanted to go but Generic_Name stopped him because he was very sick and she didn't want her father to die and she also didn't want their town to be destroyed Generic_Name decided to go to fight by her self . When she was on her way to the soldiers she decided to pretend to be a boy because she knew that if she shows her self as a girl the general will send her back to her father's house .When she got there Generic_Name trained for the war ,she was so ready to fight. The general told them to get ready for the war so that when the enemies comes they start to shoot them first. But the other group planned a really bad way to finish them so when they got there they were all shoot by the enemies except for Generic_Name .She fought all the enemies and they were all died. but when she finished she was so tired so she felt down and slept. when she was asleep the fake hair dropped .When the soldiers came they were so happy but when they saw her they were surprise.``A girl she's a girl,"" one of the soldiers said. When the general came he was so angry that wanted to give the other soldiers permition to kill her but he remembered that she helped them won the the first war so he decided to let her go home and never come back. One day the enemies surrounded the soldiers and they were all attacked. The news was all over the place .The villagers were so afraid because they didn't have any one to protect them .Generic_Name din't want their general to die so she planned something .She went to the enemies secretly .She killed all of their enemies and then she went to their captain . ``Your highness I know the person who wanted to kill you,"" she said. ``He said that he is not afraid of you and he is waiting for you your highness,"" she said. ``Do you you know where that person is now?,"" Asked the captain. ``Yes and he said he's waiting for you ,""She said. ``Take me there,"" Said the captain.``OK ,"" She said. So she took the general out side. But when the general got there he didn't saw any body. ``Where is the person?,"" the general asked.``I am the person,"" Generic_Name said. At first the general laugh and laugh but when they started fighting .The general died and the people didn't have any problems. And from that day on Generic_Name was accepted to be a soldier and everybody respected her .

One job that i would like to work to would be a soldier because i want to get a lot of money and I also want to help the citizen just like Generic_Name did. At first Generic_Name thought that being a nurse was the right thing for him but when he stepped to soldier he didn't have any problems about money and his poor family now lives good life because of their child is a soldier. At first the general though that girls can not help on the war but Generic_Name wanted to prove it and she proved that women too are strong enough to be soldiers.

29595ADA257B,"To begin, I agree that first impressions are impossible to change. First impressions is like you see or meet a new person and think about them. First impressions affect how people think of you. Its also important for a new job you are trying to apply. My other reason is you dressing a certain way that people like or dislike. Last reason is how you speak or talk to other people.

My first reason is people think of you differently. If you see or meet a new person and did something bad on accident they wont like you. Now they see you as a bad person because you did one bad thing in front of them. You can't change what people think or feel about you. People will also mistake you for someone your not. Being someone your not makes you a liar and a disappointment that people will see in you.

My second reason is the way you or others dress. Fashion shows the way people see or make them feel about you. Having nice clothes show good impression to you and others. If new people see you wear a suit or a dress they think your rich or shows how responsible your are. But if you dress like a homeless man they think you are poor and shows how irresponsible your are.

My third reason is first Impressions are also important for a job. Show your employer how good you work so you can get the job. If you mess up on your first day he probably wont like you and fire you. Be nice and responsible to your new boss, make him glad and happy that your working for him. Ask your boss questions if you are stuck or need help.

My last reason is how you speak to other people. If someone new hears you yelling or saying bad words they think you are not polite and disrespectful. Be polite to others and never say bad words in public so people won't think your rude. To make new people like you, say nice things to them, tell them things that will make them happy. Be smart and dont be a bad mouth, have nice things to say don't get in trouble.

Is not a great idea to change how you are to impres other people. Like for example I'm shy meeting new people but sometime I don't know what happen to me that I talk to people like I meet them before. Not all what you see is who it is sometime the apparance lies. People sometime lie to get something or someone. Other people do it to get attention because they fell alone and they change to get attention.

Other people do it to get attention because they fell alone and they change to get attention. I sometime do it to but only because I fell left out of the group so sometime I act diffrent. I don't like it but is the only way that I can get people attention. Some people will like if they are them self because you don't what to date sameone and that person is not the person that you see in the pictur. Other people like to deceive other poeple only for the money, to play around with them or be bad with you.

Like for example I'm shy meeting new people but sometime I don't know what happen to me that I talk to people like I meet them before. Sometime when I act crazy is becasue I like someone or because I need sleep but most of the time is when I'm in love. I am very weird to be around. I like to jock a lot but that dosen't change me who am I.

Is not a great idea to change how you are to impres other people. There are sometime that you have to impres other poeple like when you are trying to get a job. You have to look impresing so they can higher you for the job. Sometime it will need more then changing who you are.

C348194433DD,"With the morden world, people are developing, they create eletricity for service people, and that is why cell phone had been born. Most of student in middle school are given cell phone by their parents. When students are in high school, cell phone is a thing they cannot forget at home, so some school do not allow students have and use cell phone in class, but some school do opposite; they allow students have and use cell phone in class for educational purpose. Using cell phone in class have a lots of benefits, students can research information quickly and easily; besides, they can save that knowledge information on their phone. Not only that, they will fell freedom when they are in school, so they will be responsible for their studying.

When children are growing up, they will not listen their parents because they think they are adult, they just action what they think they are right. So, school will absessing them; they just think they go to school because they have friends, they can talk with their friends, and they will not care to studying. Besides they cannot using their phone, they will create a gamne to annoy people around them. Day by day, they will be a bad students. Students have to feel they are freedom, then they will focus on study the best. In the United States, students in high school start at 7:20am and finish at 2:10pm. After that, they have most of half day to do their homework and hang out. They still have their freedom, and they will not feel they are stress too much. But in Asia, students start at 7:00am and stop at 11:30am; they have to go home for eating and coming back to school at 1:00pm and finishing at 5:00pm. That is a terrible schedule. they have to learn at least eight block for a day. Both students in America or Asia, they still have homework, if they think they are freedom at school, they will do their homework very well. When people feel comfortable and happy with activities they work everyday, they will do that the best, and they will make a consequences very excellent.

Bad students do not mean they study terrible; they do not want to develop theirselve because they feel boring with their activities. If teacher focus on students, they will see when they have activities with a group, most of bad students will be one group because they have the same idea, it is not care. Therefore, if school allow student have and use cell phone in class for education purpose, a group, which are bad students, will win that activities. Why? With bad students, they are not stupid, they just do not want to study because they think studying so boring, but it will be different when school allow student use cell phone for educational purpose. Step-by-step, bad students will have sense when they need to use cell phone and when they are not. Every students when they are allowed to use cell phone in class, activities will be not boring. If teacher create a activities, school allow to use cell phone, and winner will have a gift or extra credit, absolutely winner will be a group with bad students. Because they research information quickly more than other students. Day by day, when they feel school is happy and comfortable, they will get a good consequences. Not only that, they research information, then they can save that in their phone. At their freetime, they can look back their information, they can study, and they will feel studying more easy.

Beside that, scholl still have rule for using cell phone. Students just can use cell phone for educational purpose, they cannot use cell phone everytime, that will be helping student know when they can use and when they cannot. If they can use evrytime in school, cell phone will be not advantage, it will be disadvantage. Students will not use cell phone for educational purpose, they will use for playing game or texting. So, school still have rule for using cell phone to help students are a good students

To conclude, schoold allow student have and use cell phone in class have a lot of advantage but still have disadvantage. If school have a adequate rule, using cell phone will help students too much for studying.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.204564571380615,6

93385DED39E7,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

When i was 15 years old, i broke my leg and that made me incapable of going to the school for 3 months, during those 3 months i didn't get any support to keep track on my classes because the school i was attending didn't had distance learning; Consequently, i almost failed my school year, because of this i support the option of having distance learning.

The fact that some schools have the equipment to offer distance learning is motivating, because it gives an opportunity to teenagers that struggle to get the education they need and this can be for several reasons that can limit them to get to their schools such as a medical condition, being isolated from their schools, or any circumstances that can happen during the school year; Furthermore, having distance learning as an option that is beneficial to the students and to the schools in general.

Students who are having problems to get to their schools, for factors such as not having money for the transportation or the schools are located too far from them, will benefit of having distance learning. For example, if a student can't get to his school because he can't afford a way to get to their classes on time; Consequently, the student is probably going to fail his school year for not being able to get to his classes, this shows that having distance learning support is beneficial for students that struggle with this type of problems.

Students who have for a medical condition, will have problems to get to their schools because of their medical state.

For example, a teenager that suffer from osteoporosis is hardly going to be able to get to his educational institution, and this is not going only to affect the student in his education is also going to damage his life by not having that knowledge that he needs to be progress as a person in his life; Furthermore, having support of distance learning to student that can't arrive to schools is an important and necessary characteristic that every schools must have in their options, this demonstrates that having distance learning support can help student that suffer from a disease that makes them unable of being present in school.

One of the most important characteristic of having distance learning is that it can be useful in scenarios where the students are in danger of coming to the school for something like a pandemic that would make the schools close, losing a huge a amount of days that will have an impact on the school year; Similarly, to what is happening with the COVID-19 in several country's around the world that are getting infected by this disease and where they are closing the schools because of this virus, however with the use of temporary distance learning students would be able to keep on track of their studies even when a disease or something similar to this is happening at the moment.

On the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply don't care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice.

In conclusion the use of distance learning in schools is important and useful to the students when they have problems to get to their educational institution and that it also can be used in scenarios where the student won't be able to assist to the school.",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,8.0,7.326176166534424,7

9685DD18847A,"Some students don't have an idea of what career they want to take when they enter high school. Family members and teachers expect students to know what career they want when they enter high school, so it can help them choose the classes they need. I think students should have time to choose what they want to major in.

One reason I think students should have time to think what they want to major in is; they can get tired of the career they chose or change their mind of what career to take. For example, my friend Generic_Name is in AFROTC, she has been in AFROTC for 3 years. In her Junior she decided she wanted to leave AFROTC to do something else, she wanted to do nails instead. If Generic_Name can leave AFROTC her scheduled for the next school year can change. She will have to learn how to do nails and learn the more, difficult, ways to do them as well. For this reason it will be good for students to take their time and find out what they really want to take. They have all of high school year to think about it before they entering college.

Another reason students should think about what they want to major in is, they don't know what career to take or they could have many options but can not chose one. One career could be too difficult or one could be fun but not earn has much. Students should look over the careers they want and see if it is right for them. For example, I have 3 careers I'm thinking about but can not choose one. I have 1 year to think about which one. For me photography would be the one for me as I like to take pictures of the most beautiful places in my home town. I would also like to see other parts of world, see beautiful people who live there, work with amazing people, and see what I can take a picture of. i also want to the world to know what is going on fromw the different parts of the world and not the news. i want people to see it not hear.

Some students already know what career they want to take. Most of the students are thinking which one will be good for them, and which suits them the best. It is good for students to know what career they want, but it is also good for them to think it over or think it through. As students already know what they want to do and go straight to college. Some students like to take a break and not go to college right after they leave high school. These students are taking a break to figure out what career to take, what college to go to, and save money to be able to go to college. This can help the students in many ways. In one way if the student does not like their major and think its too hard it will change major. The student will keep changing major until it finds the right for him/her. By taking a break the student can think if he/she really likes the career they have chosen.

For all of these reasons I do think it Will be good for the students to take their time on choosing a career. They don't have to have a hard time choosing one or changing the career for another one. If they don't have an idea of what career they have a lot of time. They can take a break and think very well about their options. It can help them from not changing majors when they are in college. Students taking their time for choosing careers is good for them and will help them choose the right career for them.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,7.0,7.470853805541992,7

he won't give you the job because he have a bad impression of you.

Is important prove always good impressions,

because is part of the life, and your semblance is amazing when you see a kind people with good education, your expectations are this person have a good education, Is true you can change the first impression but is almost impossible because the people make a idea of you if you act with bad actions they will going to judge you, and think that you are a bad person because they have bad impression of you but is not good when the first time you prove a good impression, and with the time you changes.

Did you know that if you pick up trash out of your way or someone else way you can actually help them think about why did they not pick up trash. Act of kindness are everywhere from picking up trash to doing your brother or your sisters chores one day they will realize something about why you wash their dishes everyday. I think kindness is the most important personality of a human being why i think kindness is a important personality?

You can change peoples mind or the way how they think about some stuff, for example if you can help someone to get across street when their is too much traffic you are doing a act of kindness, and you can help change other kids minds by making them think about their parents who is trying to cross the street trust me they will jump right in. One important thing about kindness is that you always need to have a positive set of mind that means that if someone is asking you for help jump right in and help him don't just answer ""I don't know"" if you actually don't know where the place is try asking someone else if they know about the place the other person is talking about.

Some people take kindness in a negative way only some people and at a certain time some people like to do stuff on their own and sometimes they like their own time and own place and own work they don't any help from others like me sometimes I like to do stuff on my own, but sometimes I need someone to help me. I would like to help people in need for example; taking out someone else trash, helping my new neighbors settle in the community, and mow my new neighbors lawn.

kindness can open many opportunities some people even think that kindness is a part of their religion and I really think it should be a part of every religion because it can really help you and people around you and you can change each others mind or opinion on one thing by kindness,all these thing just does not sound it is possible but it could be. To be honest I think that kindness is one of my superpowers if you ask me but sometimes its not but those times without kindness goes by quickly with kindness on your side you can become anyone you want and be a bigger person that everyone.

In these days people who understand kindness they are actually showing kindness and they are also telling us to be kind to each other. I feel like kindness has become a big part of peoples life in 2019-2020 and i expect the same or more amount of kindness over generations and I also feel like that the person who really teaches us kindness in childhood is our parents.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,7.0,6.665585994720459,7
6253F73FBABF,"As my opinion i disagree because ""you could be someone beyond the world"" if you are positive of yourself. you could take a risk of many things you want to do in life and become something wonderful of it. you can graduate and became someone you wanted to, thats growing masterly of no matter how many times you have try but where has got you.

Be a person with so many mistakes but the also is going to learn from them and,you will still come back up and start trying again.

If you have done so many things and you still feel like no other person is going to appreciate of the things you have done and then you feel like theres nothing that you could do that could be good enough for nobody. Dont stop trying do not ever make yourself feel like you gotta do things for other people just be great how you are with or without mistakes you could be wonderful and make yourself happy and proud of them.

In life theres so many responsibilities you have to take care of and no matter what does responsibilities are you still take care of them you dont give up because if you do you wouldnt be able to go to school and becoming someone in life you wouldnt be able to to eat you wouldnt be able to work or to do many things but you stills do them because you have to and because you do become someone out of them you become a person that graduates a person that works everyday to put food in the table a person that after words its gonna be proud for they have done and that is always good enough and that you grow everyday from it. you could become a person that could afford a car with nobody asking help and you grow everyday with or without people because you are strong like that. theres another step where family comes along and you got to be able to take care of your family you got to get your family food you gotta get then clothes you gotta get them shoes you gotta get them the most important things they need and you still get your family out of any circumstances you still get up every morning to get your money and help your family or each other up and you still grow from not just growing from it but you also get to know how something people get to appreciate what you really do for them. honestly you grow of some many ways you didnt have no idea you could but you still get through it.

be someone in life is about growing little things you have left out to make them bigger. Believing in yourself is always something that is gonna help you to a positive person.

Making good choices in your life is another part of you not just because sometimes you learn from them or where they could take you but how you get when you learn from your bad choices and how sometimes you react and you say to your self that you just want for your self to do good things.

Dont ever in your life say that your things are never worth of any tries you have made because the're really are worth of every single part of your life there are step you always take. If you want to be a great person dont thought of yourself you know you could do it you could grow of it other people would love so any wonder things and person you really are.

being positive of your self is the most amazing thing you could do like for example you could be positive and just be like i will pass a test or i will pass but you are just being positive that you are sure you could do it because not you only are positive of yourself you are also showing that you could believe that you can do it. being organist with your self is less stress full because you dont got worry about get so many things out of your way the same day. Happy is showing every body that no matter they think about you you dont pay any attention to them even if you have try your best to become friends and it still not even working out so you just gotta leave the person and just let it be you just gotta show the person that you did try and if for that person your friendship wasnt good enough then dont bother. Unless you really dont try at all you will never grow even if you have put your best effort your best part you will grow and become a person that others are just going to admiral you.

could you really learn from life yes!! you can be aware of it but hey!! we are not perfect nobody was born perfect we can make as many mistakes we can or we could be the greats but no theres nobody perfect that could tell you that you cant do something when you know more then anybody else that you can and that you are not perfect. It doesnt matter how people make you feel at the end of the day it would only be you and your family and the effort to put on the things you want to become the best not perfect but the best. Sometimes is just matter of time for you to really tell yourself that you could try your hardest and not give because life is not about just being a completely fail nope you could tell youself you can do it because you got it.

AAEEA695FA5C,"Many people rely on themselves to do certain things, others, seek for help and guidance. These people are most likely to have success at what they're planning to do than those who don't. People who value self-reliance should seek for guidance from experts and authorities because they will gain more knowledge, more opportunities of succeeding, and it will also help you decide what is best for you.

A good way to seek for guidance is by asking others for their opinion. Not only will you have another perspective of things but you will also gain knowledge. An example for this is going to school; you learn many things by asking the teacher for help. Doing this will definitely help you obtain more knowledge and it will prepare yourself for the future. Having other people giving you their opinion is a big help because you have another perspective of things and you can decide what is best for you.

Another reason of why people should look for help is to succeed. Success comes from you putting effort into what you want achieve and knowing how to achieve it. Some people know more than you do, so looking for guidance is a good way to reach your goals because it can lead you to the right way and it'll help you to become successful. Not always will you reach success, but there's a very high chance of doing it if you look for help instead of relying on yourself.

Looking for help will definitely make you realize what's the best option for you. Not always following your own ideas help you choose the best option, seeking guidance will. There is plenty of people who will guide you to do the right thing because they already have that knowledge. A good example for this is Personal Trainers; they will help you choose a good diet, workout, and lifestyle. Personal Trainers help you by deciding workouts and a good diet because they already have that knowledge of what to do. Looking for guidance will help you choose what is best for you, sometimes following your own ideas is not a good option.

Therefore, people should seek for guidance from experts and authorities. It's always better to seek for help in order to achieve big things and have success. Relying on yourself is not wrong or bad, but it's not the best option.                  ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,9.0,8.477811813354492,8
F3A5981B0288,"Is a good idea that the students identify a career by the time they enter high school, and think about the future.

The importance of decide what career the students want to take before they leave of the high school,

is to prevent to be confused when they enter to the University . For example , if the students take mechanic courses or courses about how to be a Doctor in High School , would help them to experiment what career they would like to take after High School .

If the students decide experiment to be a nurse or doctor , they will go to a Central Medic or Hospital and get information about that career , or they will go to a mechanic workshop to learn and get knowledge about how to be a mechanic .

Is a good idea for students think about a career to young age or try to be prepare for the future and take some courses of study in high school because if the teenagers try to found some career that can be agreeable for them and try to learn about it , it is a good form that they can be prepare in the future .

With the opportunity of learn in different courses in high school , will be more easy for the students to decide what specific career they like more and they want to learn and study after high school

In other hand , the specific courses in high school , would be selected by the students , because if they decide to take a course that they like , they will enjoy at the same time , and they will try to do the better they can

0A7DEB4B5011,"During our entire life, we take a lot of decisions; some of these decisions, the ones that are more relevant than the other, are the big decisions and they influence our life. So, should people follow their ideas and instincts instead of seek guidance from experts? The answer is yes. People should follow their own belief and ideas because by doing that they achieve what they really want, they are not influenced by other people and they learn to be take decisions independently without guidence.

Although some say that people should seek guidance from experts and authorities, because it helps people make better decision and makes them less confused, this is incorrect; eventhough people take the decision whit the help of an expert, the human brain can be easily influenced by other subjects. Is important that people keep up with their ideas. In life what really matters is what you want.

First, by following their belief, people achieve what they really require and desire; for example, we live in a world where we are all influenced by others, but if you do something just because is what your friend did, was it what you really wanted to do?. This happen with frequency in people that don't follow themselves. For this reason an individual should not look on what others do, but he or she should look on her mind and search what are his or her ideas.

Second, take a decision by themselves can help people grow mentally. For example, an individual can maybe don't take the right decisions in a specific moment, but he can learn from this mistake, especially the teenangers, and take the right decisions later. Self-reliance is what an individual need to grow and follow his or her own ideas. During our life we proprably have to take a decision by ourselves, we must be able to affront it withouth a guide.

In conclusion, people should follow themselves, their own ideas, and belief with self-reliance, because in this way they are not influenced by other subjects, whit other ideas; there will be not always somebody that can guide a person to take the right decision, people should be able to take it by themselves. In what you believe and what your ideas are, is what really matters in life.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,8.0,7.182919502258301,7
DE3867FD43DE,"well hello today I will discust the diferent between working wit a group or working alone first let me ask you a question how hyou like to? with a group or alone? well i chose working with a group lets see why...

working in group and working alone have advantages and disavantages for each one,I like wirking as a group because your team can help you with some ideas and ways to do your work and at the same time have fun while your are doing the work. disavantages in a group there will be always a person that want to be just playing around and don't like to do any type of work just have fun. nut if we being on the side of be working alone thant advantage will be that you will have more oportunity of do your work the way you want to and no be worry about other people opinion. you will finish your work faster and the way you want the wor kto be done,but some disvantages you will no have fun because you have no one to be with and it will be difficult to have a lot of ideas. i think working with a group is more beneficial because if you think there will be more people at the ppresentation helping you and you will feel more secure with your work.

working with a group can help you to increase your skill level of talking and self confidence and being social(meet new friends) , working alone can sometimes can get borring and you dont finish the work because you don't have someone to share the ideas with,

workingt alone can cause you a damage on yuor personalty and your aparetion people will think i he don't like workign with aother person around that he should work by it self andf then there will be a lot of caos that person fall in depresion because no one acept him and it was because you make them to be like that or feel that way.

while you are working with a group you learn skilll like having respect for others and diferentsd way of doing things and work as a team,or even for example you love play sport well you can not do it by your self because there will be team, and how you will work as a team with out learning how to work as a group, you need to learn how to work as a team if you want to be succesful in the comunity, in your future working with a group with the perople you trust you learn that friendship is alway good for you have thar confident that people you like being with help you to increase on your life that is a feel that no one can easy aford it.

went oyu are working with a group friendship will always be there why because is the keey of being succesful on your life. in your future, and your career, in your job.

for example;

lets said that you was driving on the higway driving normal but you forgot to past by the gas station you are in the middle of the street you don't have gas well if you don't like to work with a group then you will push your car and problably you will end up getting a desease or crashing another car.

while if you learn how to work as a group then you can have four people helping you push your car others stop the traffic and some calling the police to help you with that issue.

now you see why it is importan to learn and work as a group, even though with that you already meet new people and have new friend,what I try to said is that working with a group help you a lot in harders things that you need help with.

working alone is depent of what kind of personality you have and if you love working with out people than is fine but there will alway a time that you have to work as a team or group becasue there are things that someone by them self can not accomplish.

when you work as a group you gain respect and great friend ship because if you help with everything then everyone will love working with you and you now will feel that you are important and useful, something that working alone it will be dificult to make.

well i hope you like my explanation i did my best and i feel that we should be more socialize with other nad let then join us for our better future so they can have friends and they never feel like their are alone, lets make everyone happy and having a good time helping other and always respectful.",2.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.55156946182251,6

The first time ever meeting you they can just be shy because there getting to know you. That's how some people work. It happens a lot in the work area. When I first went to work for my first day I was really shy and didn't talk to anybody, but now that i've been working there for 3 months and i've gotten so much comfortable with everyone there.

Once you have gotten to know the person there personality changes thought out your friendship. It makes you think who you probably met in the beginning. Sometimes they could just be lying to you just to see if your a good friend or just to make them sound better about them selves.

When you first meet someone they can for sure come off rude but then after you get to know them its like there another person. Thats how I really am, I just come off as a really mean person.

You could bump into someone and th ey probably get mad and start talking to you so rude. You'll never know they could become your best friend.

Do you think imagination is more important then knowledge? I agree with Albert Einstein because if people focus on getting more knowledge people won't be trying to solve the problem with imagination. When more people come in to the USA then people or trying to stop it and not focusing on the students and staff that want help when in need. When people do their taxes the money goes to helping solve the problem so people should do their taxes to help solve the problem faster so kids can have go learning environment. The more the President wants to work on trying to get a imagination law to be made he should be focusing on the over things he ran for president not just one thing for years.

I mean having knowledge is good to get the job you wanted since you were a kid but i say it's better to work on imagination while working on helping people in need.

F8B49772E887,"Therefore, I agree with being honest all the time because it will help you gain trust with other. This can also sat that the person think's you are loyal and trustworthy and that they can believe in you more then they already did. Yes is may hurt the person feelings,but, you are there to help them get though it and make them feel OK.

When being honest with people it can build up trust with you two because they know that you can talk about things without lying. This can also effort how they see you as a person. Even if the truth hurts them they know that you were able to tell them what was happening or if someone was saying something bad about them. This can also build up trust and build up friendship and relationship. People don't like it when you lie to them because it hurts them and makes them feel bad about them self.

Honesty can change how people view you as a person. They can even see if you would be loyal to them when they need you the most. They can also see if your a real friend or something more with being honest. This can also give you respect that you want or need. When I said they would view you different I meant by your personalty and how you are as a person.

Yes, honesty can hurt them,but, lying hurts the most. Why I'm saying this because honesty can hurt but it make them feel better because they have someone they trust and believ them, a real friend. Lying and changing up the word can hurt them and even mess them up and change them. That why I agree with being honest all the time.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,5.0,6.069081783294678,6

Your positive attitude help you so much in your work because you not are going to get mad if someone or something is incorrect you will know how treat things and people correctly.

At your home or school or any place that you are is good to have good attitude like if are in a soccer team and you wants to motivate your team to think positive and act like you maybe they are going to win the game.

ACCB25B78915,"The first impression is the most important part, when we are going to met one person for the first time that maybe is impossible to change, because is one of the first thing that people see of you that maybe you can change in the future and demonstrate who you are, because if you tried to appear something that you are not in that moment later always the true come out.

I am disagree with this statement because not always is impossible to change your first impression, maybe the first time that you met someone was not the best or you was scared about what others going to think about you,

but that is not mean that you can not change everything, if you start again and let others know your characteristics and know who you are that is going to change, the first reason is why people pretend to be different is to convince others to be someone else at first, and let others judge without know anything about them and make their own conclusion.

for example when you apply for a job, your trying to impress the boss of the job because you want the job but at the same time you try to make he thinks that you are one person that you are not, when the time pass, he saw your true personality how you are, that is where you have the opportunity to change the first impression of you and demonstrate your abilities and how you can be there, everyone has the chance to change everything and start again.

Based on my experiences, when i know that i am going to see one person for the first time i try to look good and be myself, because the first impression that i want to let them know is that i am secured of myself and i do not have to pretend to be someone else, but when i am going to met someone try to make them to be them self and if they pretend to be another person, i can give it to that person the opportunity to to change.

In conclusion,

The first impression is important for someone people but not for everybody, i think that if we make a mistake the first time we have the opportunity to change everything, start again and demonstrate who we are, that is why i am disagree with the prompt about that is impossible to change the first impression because everyone is nervous that day and they can make a lot of mistakes, but that is not a reason to do not understand and do not give another opportunity to demonstrate who they are in reality.",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,6.0,6.086862087249756,6
A7CC5A46675A,"In my opinion, most of the students are finish with their corse classe already by their junior year. Therefore, I think that having the program in our high school can benefit us. Some ways that it can benefit us by preparing us to go to college, it gives us more time to be with our family during the weekday, and it gives us time to work.

Preparing for college, can be very emotional and physically exausted. Some of the reason is that we are worring on which college we want to study or does your ""GPA"" is sufficient good that any college will accept us. One example I have about getting ready to go to college is that once upon a time, my big brother was going to college and his GPA was 2.9 he was so anxious because he couldn't get to any if the colleges that he really wanted to go to. He kept searchign for colleges that offered a basketball course and he had found out that our school had a program for basketball. As soon as he found out he signed up and was accepted real quick.

Another reason, on which it's good to have programs in our school is that we can actually spend more time with our family because we will be able to be at our house earlier. One time I was at school and my sister was in the hospital but I could not be at the hospital with her because I had three sol's that week. Everyday when I got out of school she was already asleep and wouldn't wake-up until the next morning, she had neumonia so we could barely talk a litlle bit. My point is that if I or my brother had the choice to be in the program we could've be with our sister because we wouldv'e been out at 1:30pm.

My last reason, is that having a program also helps us to have more time in the afternoon to work and help our family with families with their bills and their needs. We can also, save money for our college and for our selfs too. In my opinon, we have to work hard to get what we want, and what ever is that we are working for, will come with lots of blessings.

In conclusion, we should have a program in our school so that we can grow more as professionals and have more responsabilties. We can prepare for college, be with our family, and work while we are in the program. Also, we can helps those who are still in ninth, tenth, or eleventh grade accompish their goals same way as we did but, we have to be thankful with those who helped us reached our goals.

The best accomplishment that you can have is graduate from high school, because when you have your diploma you can have a OK job or a great job, that pay good amount of money just for you or for your family. and the second reason is you can make your own business, and that how you make more money and mostly you can chose people that can work for you if you don't like how they work can fired them and find other people that can better. more people you find more of your business will out there.

And they have to have cell phones in any free time they have for any emergency that could happen in there family. then if they don't have cell phones they will not know. so you see u should pick policy one then they know that they will at least use it in there free time and will not use it in class. Plus you should add a little to policy one you should say that if they use the phones in class then there phones will be taken away and they will have to wait two days so they can pick them up from the office. there then they will not use the phones in class but in there free time so they wont have there phone token away.

65ED63C5796A,"Small acts of kindness can have a big or small impact on others. Any little acts of kindness can let people go on with their day without worrying and can make someone feel better about something that cause them to be troubled. No one has to be grand or big with their kindness. Kindness can easily be showed by the smallest things in a persons day without having to realize it. Opening a door for someone, complimenting a person on how they're dressed, helping out a parent, and etc can be acts of kindness.

Being kind means that everyone is open to being kind to everyone around them, no matter what race, different opinions, preferred partner, and even age. Kindness is for everyone. No one should be excluding others around them that are different. Being accepting and opening minded to anyone for what they are is another way of showing a small act of kindness. Being open minded will let people feel more comfortable around others and with themselves.

Showing hospitality and being polite can improve others with being a kind person in general. A person can be having a bad day because of a test they failed, showing positively and comforting them is showing a small act of kindness. Being positive to others around can help a lot on developing a mature and happy mindset. Positively will help a great amount with being kind to others. In the end of the day, everyone will get kindness back for the amount of kindness and care that they have given to others.

The ancient Greek storyteller Aesop said, ""No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted."" Like what Aesop mentioned, small acts of kindness that is given to others will not wasted, but will be shared with everyone.

Online school could not only help scholars to graduate on time, but also help a portion of scholars that are looking to get a job for future education, or helping their households. Online school may also be a helpful option for scholars with disabilities, or illness that might stop them to attend school.

Although online school might be a good tool for some scholars it can also cause negative outcomes such as students not doing their assign work, or not passing the class due to less time with students. Other issues that must be faced ,are some students not having computers, or not having access to the internet to do their assigned work. Overall online school is a great tool for students that may struggle to attend school. Once its issues are met and something has being done online school may not be only a great tool for some scholars but also an opportunity to finish school without any issues.

In conclusion online school might have many issues but once its issues have being solved and students get help with access to computers, or internet it could make a big impact on young scholars. Online school may also help economy by allowing students to have enough free time to get a job to help in their households, and their future. Therefore online school should be an option in every school to help students achieve their goals, and well being                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.5,8.0,7.660398006439209,8
43AE9E4D0EFC,"I would say that I am agree because If you want a succesful life you have to learn how to made your life easy showing to the world that you are special that you can be a nice person does not matter what the other people said or think, you have to take everything with calm and if you have problems you have to solve it with a good attitude because if you get angry you do not going to solve in a good way that is why you have to be a good person with everybody, have peace in your soul, and the last but not least have a good connection with the people that are around you, you have to put a happy face to everything that comming directtly to you.

When you are a good person with all people you made them feel good and also you feel it, because when you are a goood person you are saying that you are different to everybody, because in this world we can see that alot of people are so bad but that does not mean that all of them are aqualsbut ypu do not have to stop being a nice person just because you know people that have a bad attitude, the only thing that you have to do is be away from all of them and give to yourself a chance to know that really think like you that can make you feel as in family, this people will make you feel better because you are showing to them that you can have people around you that can make you have a better life and also more succes, for example I am a good person with all people ,with my family, and with my friends; I am gonna told you something about my friends they are specil I love them and they love me you know why because I took my time to know them, now I know what they like or how they spend their time and the most important they think that I am a succes person that make have a good attitude with them and I want them in my life and I think they will have a a nice life because I see in them that they will be very succes people.

I think that have peace is a important part of your life, because from your soul you get a lot of good feelings that make you feel comfortable,but in the same way sometimes you can have something and that make you be incomfrotable but there is you have to try to have peace, I konw that can be so difficult, do not have peace inside of you can affect you in some ways in your life, I think that to feel peace you have to do things that really like you or find something that you can make always and is not bored and also not get angry so easy because just for one problem you can be mad for a weekend or more and that is not good for you there is anything better than have peace, when I was 12 my younger brother did something that do not like me in that timeand I still remember since the first day I can tell you is not good have that mind inside of me, I am 20 now and I think that mind is gonna be with me the my whole life, but I trying to do not remember but when I remember I tell to my self that I love my brother and we are so close and he is a person that is there to hear me and when I talk with with him I tell to him everything thatv is happening in my life I feel peace in my soul.

A good connection with people that are around you can help you to have a good attitude because if you meet people that always are positives or always talk about things that are going to help in your life they can influence in your future because they know what they want in their life or what is bad for them those people is nice to meet, are interesting to hear, you can learn somethings from them and you can share some ideas, but in ypur life you will know a lot of people maybe good or maybe bad some of them are going to be nice, they will ask you to go outside a lot of days or they will invate you to have fun and you will think that those people are the good for your to be succes, but let me tell you sometimes the good people are the ones that offert to you not a party if not something that can be good for your life something that is not going to affect your future , and I know sometimes you are going to feel that the people that want to help you are the bad ones but not you are wrong, I know a person that I saw a great future he studied with me, he always had good grades, he always did homeworks, he was a nice guy this happen in the sevent grade, but when we attend the nine grade he start to meet people that they had bad grades they di not do homeworks and I think they don not wanted a future, some months later his grades goes down but was because he always when I ask him where he was, he was going something bad with his new friends and then he turns to one of them , and I think he do not attend college, this is why I am saying to have a successful future you have to be with people that are going to help you in your future.

I think we all agree after this three points that were; a good person with everybody, have peace in your soul, and have a good connection with people that are around you, this make me think how important is have a good attitude, show a good attitude to everybody, and have a good attitude does not matter what is happening in your life.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,6.0,5.518312931060791,6
8840BE5A0764,"Some school districts offer students program that allow them to graduate in three years in stead of the traditional four years. All the students who follow this program are required to take courses during the summer break. It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years so they will have one extra year. For example,Generic_Name will finish high school in three years. She wants to take a long career. She ants to be a doctor. However she need to go to college beteen eigth-ten . Depends how fast she finish her career,while she is going to high school. she is working after school and saving all the money she can but also she may need to apply for a scholarship.

On the other hand Generic_Name do not have enough money to pay his college . He will have to work a whole year after he graduate to save enough money and he will able to pay his career. Generic_Name and Generic_Name were ones of all students who took the program to graduate in three years. This program benefits then a lo. they will gradute really fast. Now Generic_Name is working a full-time. He already registered to a college who really likes him. Also is not that expensive and is not too far away from is house. Generic_Name wants to be a chef, so he may need to go o college a couple years and get a loan. Also, he have to apply for a scholarship. Generic_Name counsuler is helping him to get a scholarship. In my opinion this is a great idea to finish high scchool in three years. For example students can keep busy during the summer break and they can have a part-time job after summer school. This may help students to figure out what they want to do after they graduate. Generic_Name and Generic_Name they said they took the fastest way to finish high school. They also recomended students to take this program and after that work so they can be able to pay their college.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,6.0,5.656771183013916,6
8A165723DF82,"Failure Is Success

Nothing can make you stronger then failure. It make's you more success In life, even helps you to learn a life lesson, that you can do much more then what you could image to build your life and happens.

When you did something and It makes you failure don't think that why did that happened, or why did you do that although, give up that you can't solve It, you should know and everyone else that we all are strong we will not know until failure comes to you that you are much stronger and be powerful with what you have and what come's to you

Nothing Is more Important then success your life, sometimes failures and make you life hard but It can make your life more powerful, that you will trust yourself and, It will make you stronger and you will take more responsibility for your next steps. For example, my father would tells me all the time that when you get older have your on business and you need to be strong If your not strong ""failures"" can heart you so that's why you need to work so hard and be strong as will to reach your goals. Although even If you have a good life don't think that's It that you will not have any problems anymore. If you don't work hard and not be strong failure can make your life so harder

On the other hand, life is a lesson and challenge for everyone It can take a risk so you need to be strong for what ever come to you and be powerful for not any failures so to you and break you. For example, my mom would tell me life Is a lesson each day you will learn something different and you will get stronger so you don't know when and what will happen to you so mantle and physically be strong. However If you did something learn you mistake lesson to not do It again and forget the mistake.

However, It's not good to have failure some people can't handle It so they kill them self. On the other hand, failure Is good because they know how strong and powerful thy are and nothing can break you or failure you.

Being powerful and strong Is so Important so that life will change you no matter. How or why, so you should all ways learn your lesson that, why or how did failure In your success life and happiness never let anything come between you, because you will get stronger each time and better.",3.0,4.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,6.0,5.253516674041748,5
60BD042950B1,"Working with a group is more beneficial that working alone?

Let's be honest working with group is better, this can be more beneficial that work alone, but most of the teachers ask this question at their students because they want better results in their works. Working with a group is more beneficial for many reasons the topic is to discuss with different persons in the group, this can be better and they can do the assignment in a little time and work with a group is more entertaining cause they can talk and listen the rest of the group.

When they work with a group the project is more interesting because more opinions they can listen and analyse any of them, this can be good and strengthen the project, each person in this world take things in differenst forms and when they work with a group this happen, but and any reason this help cause each person in the group work in different forms when they knowledge what they can do it better, everybody take their position start working together, loving, doing, and enjoying with a total concentration.

The work will be better because the differents forms for work that will be a benefits for the group and the project because that will be more easy for the same reason, more people, more help each person have the responsibility to help each other cause they are a group, this one is another benefits. In this point the assignment take least time for do it work together, helping each other make the assignment look better and different hope time.

Enjoying the time working with others persons, is other benefits, they feel happy and comfortable. When they work with their friends the time is amazing for them, this make entertaining and funny. Friendship can be better for work together more confidence, share moments with that people that they appreciate will be a good idea and will be help for their carrying out in the group and this one is other thing for that reason work with a group is more beneficial than work alone.

Many times the people when they work together is not exactly good idea, everything in a sense have a bad point because some person do not help to their group, they do not have interest for the assignment, simply forget help and contribute. Many times in the end only one person is doing all work, the differents opinions aren't important.

I my opinion i think it would be fun cause you'll be picking stuff were u had never been before.. Like if u go to a park and start picking trash you could be making the plants healthy and you'll be getting your hands all dirty your cloth and i think that is fun.

F893E9ED1F0C,"Should school have to add one and half hours to each day? I disagree because student have to do stuff after school like some student have practice for sports and more. Another reasons why I disagree is because student might not like school and it can get boring. Something else why I disagree is because parents might want you after school for something and if you come from school late them can't do what your parents are telling u want to do.

Some reasons why I disagree is because you might have to do thing after school. Something are you might have sports practice for a team or for clubs. Another reason why is because some students have family things to do out of school and it would be for a long time. Some student would have doctor appoints and that is very important.

Another reasons why I disagree is because student will get bored in school. Some student can start to get mad try to leave the school and get in trouble and the student can get in a fight. Something else is that student can fall asleep and not pay attention to the teachers and they can get trouble as well as the student can stay even longer. Something is that they would not be able to learn if they fall asleep.

Last reasons why I disagree is because parents might need their child after school for something. There parents might need them to help clean them clean there house. If they need to tell them something important. Another reason why is because there parents might need help to buy food for there house. Some parents might not like that because they would not be able to see there child for a long time.

That why I disagree because school is just for certain time it not all day. Some student will get bored and not want to come school again. They might have thing to do after school like sports and practices or other thing. Some student parent might need help from there child and would want to see them more time not for a little while.

CD99E2D6DBE9,"Hey dear employees.

I'm writing this letter to tell you about some of my characteristics that are needed for this kind of job. I'm a responsible guy, who likes to be able to help the others if they need help in anything. Also I'm a hard worker because I'm constantly doing work, never stopping to do anything else if I'm not do with my work.

First,I think that I'm a responsible worker, because I never stop doing my work until I'm done with it. A lot of people tells me that I should get this kind of job, because I dont like when people are irresponsible and since I'm a responsible worker the rest of employers will like how I work, then they will start to their work just like I'm doing mine. I'm always on time. I'm always trying to able to do all the work and to help the others if they don't know how to do it. If I want to go out and be with friends, the first thing that I tell them is that I have to finish my work if I have time to go out after work then I will be able to go with them, but if Im not done then I cant go, because the job is the first thing that we all should have in mind, then the second thing are friends, free time, all that kind of stuffs.

Second, I'm a hard worker in any job, because I like to demonstrate that I can do the best and any job at anytime. So if you need that type of employee I think I'm the right person, because I will work very hard to finish the job by one day. I don't like to many works to be doing at the same time, so I try to finish one per day so later on I wont have to come and start to do the same work I was supposed to finish the day before. Like I said I like to work hard, to finish everything by the same day. I like to make other people work hard to, not just me, because if we all work hard we are all going to be successful in this job, I'm not trying to be successful by myself, I like to see more people success in life. A lot of employees dont work hard for the job that they have, if they dont work hard, that makes the company or the rest of workers look bad because he doesn't want to do anything. That's what I'm trying to change in this job. I'm trying to get this job because I know that I can help other people succeed, I can make this work by helping others and by working hard every day.

In conclusion. I think this are good reasons why I would be a good candidate to be hire for this job, I'm here trying to get this job, so I can help the others to be good workers and help the company look better, because we will work hard and be responsible to make the best out of the best.

Sinceraly.

AC8331539332,"""Do we choose our own character traits, or our character formed by influences beyond our control?"" I think you should be you own character because not everyone has good intention in this world, and most people love seeing other people at their lowest just so they can feel good about themselves, or be proud of themselves so that they prove something and they can say that they're more successful than you. That's exactly why you shouldn't trust everybody thats around you. Its okay to communicate or socialize with people every now and then but don't put your 100% trust in them because it's always that one person that you wouldn't expect to betray you and really will. People are good at hiding their true colors. You shouldn't let people influence you in any type of way, be yourself and have confidence in what you want to be in life, after all its you life not theirs. For example, if your parents wants you to be something you dont want to be, don't to it because again its your life not theirs. I understand that that's you parents but live your life and just have faith and trust yourself.

You shouldn't be acting like someone your not, a lot of people act certain ways or try to be someone they're, usually in a relationship because they are scared that the person they're with is not gonna like who they really are, or they might be ashamed because they think that he/she might judge them if they really show who they really are, but honestly why be with that someone if they can't accept who you are? Shouldn't you question yourself, why are you even with that person in the first place, if your even thinking that they ""might"" judge you in any type of way. Sometimes its okay to think though just take a minute out of your day and think and you can actually realize a lot of stuff about people and especially how they're acting towards you. That's why I don't let people influence me in any way because you never know what that person's intentions. be your own person and don't ever be someone your're not, and you should never change for someone just cause they don't like you for who you are, your friends and your family should accept who you are and respect your decision. Sometimes it takes time to see who's really there for you but one day you are gone see who are really there and support you in every step. For example, if your friend don't respect your decision making to something that you wanna do then you should know or question, are they really friends or are they really there for me? because people come and go.

My point in all of this is just be yourself, trust yourself, have confidence what you wanna be and don't let somebody take control in your life or don't get influenced by people that don't have good intentions in you, basically make the right decision. Don't try to be perfect for somebody else's, if you wanna do that then do it don't do it for somebody else, do it cause you wanna do it.

But, I agree that you should be your own character , because you can't trust everybody or expect everybody to have good intentions in you, do something for yourself not cause she/he wants you to do it. Don't try to act or be somebody that you're not, show who you really are and your true color because that's how you really know who is there for you and who is just faking to support you because they want to see you at your lowest. It takes time for other people to open their eyes but when they do they will realize a lot of stuff going on. Be yourself and don't let nobody change you in any way, be unique.",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,7.0,7.47634220123291,7

Thirdly the human mind and body could be weak and make that person mesaberal and can effect thier emotion. Such as anger,stress,sadness,worries and there will be no space for happiness. Hey! their people that work just for seven hours and they are already in a bad mood and imagen a person working for ten hours, that person will not be happy at all. So know you think "" but what! don't they have a three day off and then they can catch up on there sleep and spend good quality time for themself or faimly time?"" but that dose not help at all .Like it or not a three day off is not a grate idea for a person that is working ten hours street for four day. When a person is angry,tierd,stessed and worried,it not easy to be happy and it going to be hard to go back to their normal mood because in the end the human will reameber that they got to go to work on mondays and thier were the human mind will go back to the stress again. Theirfor it not a great idea that there work only for four week and three day off and there will be no balnce in the world or at work. Now you know about the health issue that can happen to this plan. it also let keep the 7-8 hours of work and the five day week and also the two day off.

8FFDA5B9D359,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I agree with this statement i have three reasons why I think students should be able to attend classes from home. One reason is some students have a alot of responsibilities at home and sometimes students arent able to go to school. Some might have kids and they need to stay home to take care of there kid because nobody can babysit. That's really hard for a student to do. Trying to go to school and have a kid can be very stressful to the student.

My second reason I have for this statement is some students feel comfortable having class in there own safe environment where they feel comfortable and not anxious. There are some students that have anxiety and are not able to function in a classroom full of students that can be really hard for a person because its not easy trying to get your work done in a classroom full of students and dealing with anxiety. That can be very stressfull I feel like a student should comfortable in there learning environment because when they are comfortable they achieve better in there work. They can focus better and get work done and won't be distracted by anyone there's a lot of benefits with that. Parents would also agree that having ther child in a environment that they are comfortable in is the best way to keep there child focused and willing to pass there classes without any distractions that the child doesn't need.

My third reason i agree with this statement is students can feel more determined to do there work at home in a quiet place its very helpfull to the students needs to be sucssesful. Some students get distracted easily and can't in a classroom so attending class at home helps the student concetrate and perform better with there work.

Another reason is parents would feel comfortable with there child being at home doing school work where they are safe and focused on the right things which is school work. Some students find it easier to do things online than in a classroom so its all about personal prefrence and i agree with this because it could be hard trying to understand what the teacher is saying or talking about. It's good to have a sense of understanding when it comes to learning something that's very important for students.

My conclusion to this statement is that i agree and I think it is a great idea for schools to offer this to students because it gives students a chance to be at home and pass there classes with no distractions. It also gives them an oppotunity to sucsseed and graduate. I also agree about doing school online because some students find it easier and better than being in a classroom all day and not being able to understand the teacher. I also like this because you can do your class work where ever you are you dont have to be at home if you have somewhere to be you can take a laptop and do work. I think doing online class works for a busy students schedule its all around is a good idea and I am happy that schools are letting students do online classes its a big benefit for them that's why I agree with this statement.

CC11E4C2FE01,"Do you think that we should have a program to help younger students?

I think that some schools should have a program, that pairs with older students. My First reason is sometimes they go to school and dont really understand nothing that the teacher are saying, so this is where the program comes to play. Then by using the program, you connect with a random student that learn the same subject as you. And they can teach you the same thing as what your teacher taught you, but they speak to you slowly so you and the other younger students can understand if they dont understand then how are they going to pass a test or a SOL, so basically its like your getting extra help.

My Second reason is, they help younger and older students is because theyre both learning from each other, but it will be hard to make a program because we will need a lot of stuff, but its worth it because the younger students need to understand what they are doing. I think we should have programs in other schools that pair with older students because, so they can help the younger student learn, and make sure that they understand what they are doing.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,6.0,6.786697864532471,7
3C693CBFEFB5,"Have you ever wanted to know if your attending a classes from home does it benefit you ? Many students want to be educated and successful but, many problems come in there way causing public or private schools not to be the best decision for them. They decide they want to do school online and have said it has befitted them so much because, when they were doing public school they were failing there classes or the problems they were facing got harder for them to be in school. Many students have done online school and have been so successful and not only being successful but it has benefited them in whatever situation They're in right now.

Although some may argue otherwise, but through family experiences, prodcasts i've watched on the radio, and from hearing some celebrities talk.

One of my cousins named Generic_Name has been through so much and has not been able to continue going to public school. she's struggling a lot trying to keep her grades up and trying to get to school on time. she has an eating disorder. An eating disorder can be really hard at times when dealing with that and school . Her family has decided to let her do online school , and has helped her so much because while being at home eating and also going to doctor appointments she has the option to do her assignments online and also sometimes some teachers come to her house do homework assignments with her that help her a ton. Through online school she has overcame her struggle with her eating disorder and has also been so successful. As many years went by she has studied more an more. ""it's so crazy""

because while having so many problems she was facing she became a lawyer.

Some may argue that it's impossible how she became a lawyer after just doing online school, that its unfair how she got to where she is now because of home schooling, some people may say that by doing online school it can't benefit you nor can it make you a successful person it's just they way to failure. That's not true because when you hear so many stories and people talking about their experiences with home schooling you have to take to consideration that maybe it helps some and not others.

Many prodcasts on the radio have mentioned many real life situations on this subject . One i've heard that struck out to me was when this mom was talking about her son Generic_Name being really popular on social media, She said that all throughout his high school years students his age and older have been bullying him and trying to get in fights with him for no reason. The mom signed her son up for online schooling. Generic_Name did online school as well as he did video conferences with his teachers every other day . Generic_Name has found it to be more easy he said that he is more concentrated because, it's just him and his laptop there's no distractions no more students bothering him trying to fight him. Since social media is such a big thing to keep up with when doing online school ,he can do both social media and be educated. However, some may argue that Generic_Name has to be a man and grow up, he can't always hide from people that are mean to him. That's true he can't always hide from people like that, but if he's fed up with it then maybe it was the best decision you can only handle so much hate.

Celebrities have talked in their interviews about them choosing home school over school and how beneficial it was to them. There's this girl named Generic_Name .She said Being big on social media is really hard Dealing with the hate, dealing with people exposing you constantly for nothing, dealing with your name always being in people's mouth. Generic_Name has said that she's been bullied so many times and has found it harder for to deal with it. She has said that at one point she got depression and got harder and harder for her to continue going to public schools. Teachers recommended her to do online school. She took that advice and did home schooling for the rest of high school and also did online school for college as well. She said that she feels more successful. Generic_Name said that online school was the best thing she did and that she decided that for college she is going to a public college and she is also going to continue being big on social media. Some may argue that, They don't see how it benefited her. It have a major change on her, she knew what she wanted to do or be so how did it benefit her. It benefited her in so many ways, she no longer is afraid of what people think of her on social media. Sometimes people need space from public school and then when they feel that they are ready they can go to public schools again.

The importance is for people that are going through the same problems for them to look and read from past experiences. For them to see if online school is beneficial for them. In the future people can look back at this and see what people were going through and how much they were struggling. This helps to see about how the past was like to compare to how it's like now. A solution is for people to do online school if they feel like being in public school is harder for them or for, whatever reason it may be. Also for people to notice and to realize that as being said multiple times that for people that are big on social media It's hard to cope with all the hate they get. A solution is for people not to give hate to others. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,6.0,7.2654709815979,7
BC227A70B60E,"Some people argue that there should be year-round schools, because the students don't retain information as easily when they return to fall. In my opinion,would be a bad idea, because the students need to have a time of all the subjects that they took before they return to fall. I support my position with those reason:

Students have to spend more family time, and Students need to take a rest of all the pressure of the school.

Students have to spend more family time, and not always thinking about school, because their parents have more free time during the summer, and they would enjoy with them during the holiday, festival, celebration, go visit museum, travel to another country,and learn new thing in the fun way,without concern that they have to return to school soon; such as my friend Generic_Name, all her family have vacation during the summer, and they decided to go to her country Generic_City, she dosen't have any worry about it, if she come back late to school or missing test, assignments, during that time, because involuntary she learn new things, and put her knowledge in constantly working during her vacation.

Students need to take a rest of school pressure, because they can thinking more clear, and be prepare for retain new information during their new school year, and the students never forgot what they learn because the life is a constantly path to learn. Such as my sister Generic_Name, she is in her junior year, she have to take three SOL's as Biology, US History, and World History 2, and also one test in Economy & Personal Finance as requirement for her graduation, imagine this whole pressure over her shoulders, and then she have to worry to come back even in fall, than prefer she take a vacation and relaxing over her break summer, and be prepare for her senior year. Although, some people think that is a great idea, because the children have their brains fresh over school knowledge, and they could have less distraction to forgot topics, definition, including language for some people that still learning English, but those reason have less support because every students need to have a break meanwhile if they have less distraction, it's dosen't matter because vacation is for enjoy not for study or thinking about what will going to happened next year; they have to clear their brain to capture new information.

To conclude my position, I think that everything would be equal, that's means if in the school the students doing good on their assignments, test, and another activities, why the students have a short vacation, if their deserve to their long summer break, and also not just the students need that time to re-open their minds even the teachers, the people on the cafeteria and another areas where the people work, they need time too. Every students have their knowledge very safe on their brains, nobody will go to forget about it, even more students came with positive attitude after summer break to learn new topics, and with new knowledge.",3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,6.0,5.787344455718994,6
C1E9D98B3613,"I personally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson with his quote saying ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" The reason i agree is because I believe that you have to set your goals higher, if mastered something already. Its always alright to fail trying to master your goal because nobody is perfect. You also need to try different goals to master so youre good at several things.

The first reason why i believe you should set your goal higher, if you have already mastered your goal is because if you keep doing the same thing youve done over and over and have already done great at it, you will not see any growth in you. For example if i was in a soccer team and played for a rec team. Which rec is when you sign up and get put on a team with no tryouts. If i played and score almost every game and always outplayed my opponents. I wouldnt grow as a soccer player because the opponents would be easy for me and wouldnt be a challenge so i would have to set my goal higher. For a higher goal i would have to move up to travel to see growth in me and have a challenge in the game.

I believe that people also disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because they are scared to set there goal higher when they have already mastered it. The reason i think this is because they are embarrassed to fail and not do something right. When i'm reaching a goal of mine like getting three goals in the net in a soccer game. I work hard to try to accomplish my goal so i can master it and score three goals every single game. Sometimes i fail and dont score three goals but i always tell my self its alright because when youre reaching a goal you will fail at least once or probably more then once. Which makes me work harder. Nobody is perfect and always a good thing to fail to learn about your mistakes.

The last reason why i agree is because you have to try to master different things in life. Sticking with the same thing you mastered will just not make you good at anything else. Its always great to have different things youre good at because you can do a lot of other things. If you dont like any of the goals you want to master and cant reach it. Its always great to have other ones along the other one youre trying to reach because i know a lot of people change their thoughts and want to do more then one goal at a time.

You have to set your goals higher if mastered something so you can see growth in yourself. When setting your goals higher you will fail at least once, you shouldnt worry because it makes you learn about your mistakes and so you wont do what you did to make you fail. Also you have to try different things to master to be good at several things in life. This is why i agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson quote he wrote.

EEB4D170D513,"Albert Einstein said Imagination impacts more than education on people, I kinda disagree with this statement. In life there many things people want to accomplish something in their future life. Like learning a new instrument, to play sports for a team and others. One thing

I would like to do is to stay on top of all my classes for school to be succesful in life. People say its a challenge to stay on top. When I look at it, I say every challenge always has a way to get through it.

The reason why I would like to pass all my classes is because I want to use that as a skill in my life. At the end of college, people always wanted to be big things like presidents, surgeons and other important jobs. In real life people who cared less about that, are just sitting in a cubicle just to answer calls for a living, which is not a bad thing. I dont want my life to end up as those people, I want to make a big impact in our everyday society, like Steve Jobs. He made a big impact in peoples lives by releasing a new iPhone model every year, but he didnt just start a company that fast. He needed to be educated and was the smartest kid in his school, all the way to college, he was a smart and cooperative guy until his passing. Thats why I am planning ahead to stay on top of school and college so I can try to make a great impact for people. Instead of trying to stay awake in a boring office with the meanest boss in the world and with a low salary to one meal per week.

Another reason why I would like to be successful in my classes is because It made a huge impact on my uncle, Generic_Name. Back in my uncles time, my parents and my uncle lived together in a small town house in Generic_City, he was uneducated. My uncle was an outgoing guy but didnt care about his education back in college, he was always on the couch eating Cheerios and watch Tom and Jerry on the T.V. My parents and I started to convince my uncle to start repeating college, but he didnt care, he just wanted fun in his life and not care about anything education related. That all changed when he realized that he had pay rent and that he wasnt educated, so he finally took the opportunity to repeat college, we were happy for him to do it. He scored high scores in all his tests and was awarded a scholarship for Generic_School and graduated with a high masters degree for law and got a job for jr lawyer. Now, he rose up to make the best lawyer in Generic_City and makes 500,000 thousand dollars a year and lives in a mansion with nice cars and to share all his fortune with his family. This story has inspired me that I should stay on task with all my classes and to plan my future career ahead in time.

The final reason why I want be a successful kid in all my academics is because of opportunities, just like my uncle, Generic_Name, He came to the top because of smart he really was in college. Just like my uncle, I want to be like him and to open the door to so many career opportunities in which society has to offer, like Will Smith's movie, The Pursuit Of Happiness which was based on a real story . This talks about some emotional topics about a man named Chris Gardner was not making money and has his son with him to look after. He wasnt able to do his job right by selling bone density scanners and barely enough to pay rent or daycare after his wife left him. He got his life back together by repeating college and moving, but soon he opened the door to so many job opportunities and later in his life became a multi-millionare in 5 weeks. Based of this act, I started to think that anything can be possible as long as you put your mind to it. That way I can open many opportunities in my life.

These are the reasons why I want stay on top in all my academics is because I want to change the world the way people see it. I want people to know my name for all the hard work and impact I did, staying on top of classes accomplishes anything, it can make me into a very important person who makes a lot of money, but in order to complete that task. I would need enough Education to make me successful enough to encounter that career opportunity in my life.            ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,8.0,7.302123546600342,7

AA930ED0EFA7,"The idea of a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours are good for the Banks, Offices, and other departments. In school some students cannot stay that much time constantly four days. There are some student who like to have four-day school week but extending two hours will not good for them. Spending ten hours in school is like, student spend whole day in school and came home just for sleep. Some students have jobs after school and some will take care of there little brother/sister while there parents were not at home. Some students might be happy for this but they do not know how much they get tired of this. School should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours because student does not left much time to do their homework and other extra activities, Some students work after school and students do not get much time to spend with their family.

School should not follow this model of four-day school week and extending the school day two hours because students does not left much time to do their homework and extra activities. If student spends ten hours in school they do not get time to play video games and other sports games like: soccer, football, basketball and cricket. Student also do not get time to do their homework. Student do not get time for sleep, if student came from school and sleep, then they cannot sleep at night and if they cannot sleep at night then they cannot woke up in the morning. Students can be sick. Students need to fresh their mind to sleep 2 hours or 1 hours after they came back to school and do some extra activities like games. Students need to get more time, if they spend ten hours in school and just study and when they come back to home they get tired and they does not want to do anything and they also does not understand anything in school. If they could not understand anything they might be fail in the class and it could be a problem for them. Students have a lot of homework and test/quiz every day, they cannot study for test/quizzes on that much time. They also need more rest to fresh their mind. So, School should not allow ten hours extending because student does not left much time to prepare for their test/quizzes and do their homework and does not left time for rest.

School should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours because some students work after school. If school extend two hours, some students lost their jobs because some of them go to their job direct from school. Some student work to save money for their college/university fees. Some will work to help their parents. Immigrants people who will come from another country they do not have much money so there children who are in high school will also work to help their parents. If school extend two hours; Those students who have jobs, they lost their jobs and they will survive. There are some students who work whole week. If school extend two hours then student do not have rights to do anything and they left their jobs and it causes a lot of hardships in their life's. A student who have big dreams and work to save money for their college fees lost his/her job will hurt him/her a lot and they will give up. If school extend two hours , there are some students who change their job schedule just because of this: If they go late then they will come back home late and then they do not have time to do their school work and study for tests. School should not follow this model because some students work after school and this method does not help those students.

School should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours because students do not get much time to spend with their family. If school extend two hours some students will not spend time with their family because some student's parents work on weekend so they cannot meet with their children. When student will came back from school they will be tired and they only want to sleep.

If school extend two hours, student do not get a time to go somewhere; They have three day weekend but ,on those days they might be tired because of spending four constantly days of ten hours.

They might be get more homework from school because of three day weekends. They might be get sick of all this and they do not want to talk to anybody in their house. Extending two hours will far students from their families. Students need to spend a time with their family, it will fresh their mind. If student does not spend time with family, it will cause problems because in their mind there is only school stuff and they cannot think of anything else.

Adults think it's fun and educational, other people think is boring or noneducational.

First, they help me and I help them. I'm interested in Landscape Design, I would want to learn more about that work force. Many things about Business Management, improving a business is worth any companies while. In return for them helping me, we could talk about improving the managers company to draw more attention. It's a win-win for both me and them.

Second, I would convince others to participate. When I get the help I want, I could explain to different individuals that there is many work opportunities. For example, if they want to work in Construction or Welding the company can teach them about that work force. Gathering people for a job opportunity could be hard. For example: giving out fliers, business cards, or writing a book and selling it. Only what matters is to convince others to part-take in an opportunity.

Last, the company could help me become more and more successful. In the future when success comes my way, I would start my own company/opportunity work. On the behalf of the first company/opportunity-work, who has helped me be the best in the future. This is a little off hand, but it's for the one who has made me successful. Many other individuals, adults and young teens think its a waist of time or this won't help me in the future. In reality, opportunity work will help you to be successful or famous.

In conclusion,

I would help them back and help their business grow to be the best. I would return the favor of them letting help me. In the future, I would want to grow be or be famous. I feel that opportunity for future working is very important.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,7.0,7.525296211242676,8
BC4212B1546A,"British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" i am agree that the failure is important in the life social of the people. The peoples have more success in the job, have more better experience in the work or in the life of the person and in the education have a good success.

First the peoples have have bad experience in the life with family or amigos. For example the family take decision for yours son but the son do not like the decision that family talk hem and the son take in other bad decision and failure have problem with other person or have a accident, the son think in take a good decision for your future. The bad success and failure including a good education.

In the education almost all the student or peoples failure in the exam or ESL. Some student do not like to learning or studying in the class, for the motive failure but other student use the failure like a motivation and enthusiasm. Peoples in this moment existed good president, doctor engineer and lawyer all make bad decision and failure but all don't loss the enthusiasm of to be someone in the life.

Finally, peoples have more success in the job. In the job every time have or take a failure for the dangerous decision or situation, for example Barack Obama was a president of Unite States hem was take dangerous decision and action. When hem to stare to the election have problem and failure for the color or attack in the campaign hem to break and to beat for president and to help the peoples, for moment hem failure in the presidency but after hem make more good decision.

However, someone peoples have different opinion and disagree whit Prime Minister Winston Churchill said. because the peoples have failure in the life go to continuity with the failure and to take bad decision or action hover the peoples or country. But in my opinion i am agree that the failure is important in the life social of the people; you have success in the job, have experience in the work or in the life and in have success in the school or collage.

In conclusion the Winston Churchill talk about "" success consists of going from failure to failure without loos of enthusiasm"" it is really because the failure is something important in all the peoples, the failure help to make a good future and take more good decision. In for that point in this moment have excellent workers and peoples.

A9B3B0AEE38B,"I think that older and younger students being together is a really good idea cause that means that the older student can help the younger student and If an older students needs help with something one of the younger students can possibly help. I think that all schools should have programs like this because then the younger student can learn from the older one. Also the older student can possibly be an influence to the younger student like for example if the older student wants to be a doctor then maybe, just maybe, the younger student can be influenced and wants to be a doctor when the student is older. I think the effects of older and younger students working together is good because i think that the students can help each other in many things and if a younger student is getting picked on then maybe the older student can defend them and i just think that if older and younger students are paired up then they can work together and help each other on things outside of school. And maybe one of the older student can become really good friends with the younger one. I honestly think that schools that have programs like this are really good cause students can cooperate with each other and work together and maybe become friends.

3C05F5FC558A,"Is it a good idea to graduate a year early? I don't think it's a good idea to have high school for 3 years and graduate early. I believe that 4 years of high school would be a lot better because by then you'd have an idea of what you'd want your career to be. If you take 3 years of school you might have to take classes during summer, may not be able to take elective classes, or might even have more school hours. That is why I feel it'd be better to have 4 years of school and take things nice and easy.

I'd like to start by saying, if you have 3 years of high school you'll be able to graduate early but probably won't know what you want to become, you might not even have an Idea of what you want to be. I'm a junior this year and I still don't know what I'd want to be if it's either becoming a mechanic or becoming a doctor and those are only 2 careers out of the many there are. That is why it is better to have more time to be able to find out what we/you want to be or at least get an idea of what that is.

Also, if you have 3 years of school you'll have to think about the classes. Your going to have to take all your required classes first meaning you won't have many electives. If you did have electives your going to most likely have more school hours so that would mean less time at home, less time with family, and if you work you'd have to work late. So, you have to think about how a 3 year school would operate. You can graduate early but will have more hours of school.

So Finally, you might be thinking ""If I have 3 years of high school that means I'll be able to graduate early and be able to attend college early,"" but then again like I had said before what if you don't know what you want to be, it's better to take your time and think things through and know the classes you'll need in college. You might also say ""I get to work now"" well..... your right, but you can be working while attending school either way. I hope I made you think about your decision and making you agree with me, that it's better to have 4 years of high school instead of 3.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,8.0,7.599194049835205,8
4EE0B81B9133,"You are in trouble. As your teachers might tell you, behave when you are in school. That includes in the halls, cafeteria, and even on the school bus. By following simple rule that are established for your safety, you won't lose your school staff's trust.

Behave when you are in the halls. when the bell rings, and you are dismissed, go to your other class immediately. Don't take a walk around the school, go to the gym, or cause a traffic by standing in the halls and talking to your friends. It's not a safe nether is it responsible. Keep your hands to your self, unless if it's an activity that allowed you to touch the other students or even staff members with adult supervision.

Behave in the cafeteria. Once you are in line to get your food, you should respect others by waiting your turn. This isn't only respectful, but it's even a good habit. Walk back to your seat, don't run. Running could cause for you to spill your food, and someone could slip and that resulting in an injury. When you finish your food, cleanup after your self if necessary.

Behave when you are on the school bus. When you are on the bus it's nice of you to greet your bus drive, but you don't have to. Quietly walk to an open seat and sit down. Sit with your grade level. Once settled, you could quietly talk to the person sitting next to you, don't yell across the bus. On the bus it is important for the bus driver to be able to see from the back window or door to prevent car accidents, don't put your stuff in the middle of walkway. If you are going to be eating on the bus, which you are not aloud, unless the bus driver said so, clean up any mess that you may have caused.

Showing responsible and appropriate behaviors could make teachers more flexible with any other improper behavior that you may cause. For an example, you are a bad student, you were late to class, and you decided to run. The teacher catches you, and you get in trouble. Example two, you are a good student, you were late to class, the bell rings but you don't run, the teacher forgives you.

65975436BE5C,"True self-esteem dose come from praising someone to keep going and to follow their dream. Like a good friend once said ""never let anyone put you down always get right back up on your feet"". This is saying that people should believe in their self more than what other people say about them that will drag them down. People need to have thick skin to block all the negative haters and disbelievers because having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.

First, people need to be confident in their self in order to fallow what they want to achieve in life. For example, I was not confident on passing the SOL and my teacher was praising me to be positive and not to over think it. Then it came to the SOL, and when I finished it, the next day my teacher told me that I had passed. She later then told me that I should believe in my self more. This show that when someone praises another person that they will have confidants in their self.

Second, courage can be helpful in over coming fears that can drag one self down. For example, when running a relay race and you start to fall behind. People end up giving up and saying in their head I lost there is no way to catch up because Im all ready in last place. People will want a friend to cheer them up and encourage them not to quit and to keep fighting. From the courage that is given to them then they will keep running till the finish line. This shows that courage can praise someone to keep going.

Finally, many young teens should trust what adults say to them and not ignore them. However, some may say that teens can do what ever they want, they are wrong because teens need to be taught life lessons. For example, when I was younger I steal from stores with a couple of friends. My mother told me not to hang out with other teens that will cause trouble. Which I didnt listen to her and we got caught by the workers and they called our parents to come pay for the belongings we stole. This shows that by praise from adults, teens will make good choices that wont get them punished.

In conclusion, praises can be very helpful for a person to feel good about their self. When taking any kind of test people will want to be successful. To when having to play in a sport people will want to win and not quit. Also to listen to people that are there for others no matter what. This shows that having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.",4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,8.0,7.126724720001221,7

Forcing someone is not good because you cant tell someone do things that they couldnt do. Some people dont like playing sports, working the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

Not everyone have the same opinion, but many people have different opinion. Forcing an students to do something probably make them feel that they have no rights.

B5AE26EEE247,"Do you think that having a positive attitude is the key towards success in life? In my opinion I do think it is key towards success, and the reasons why I think this is one finding a good career, second is meeting new people in a good way.

In life you need money to pay bills and in order to get money for your bills is to get career, a good one at least, and everyone knows that you need a resume, a good skill that your going to work for, and a good/positive attitude to help you get the job. you people may wonder ""why need to have a positive attitude to get your job?"" well you want to impress and increase your rate of the person that is considering to hire you or not, also if start talking in a boring way the person might not hire you.

The second reason is meeting people in a good way and never in a negative way. meeting people in positive ways is very great thing to do meaning that if you treat someone like garbage they'll treat you the some or even doing something terrible that will ruin your life, and nobody like that at all, so thats why you should treat people positive to avoid the things that I mention or you just like treating people positive because thats your nature.

I know how this world works and to survive the world of negativity is to be negative as well to survive this world, however that isn't the way to live and nobody likes to do negative things as well as they can't hold it for long time and end up taking away their own life, so staying positive is a great way to live in life.

The conclusion I am trying to give at out is that being positive is the a great way live instead of living in a way of negativity since being negative is way to tough to live out and positively gives you joy and give more paths to walk through and thats what I think a key to success means.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,7.0,6.035422325134277,6

In addition to this statement the reason why the first impression is impossible is because the people did not met each other more than once they do not know their habits what they like about each other or what they do in their daily life or what they like to do like their expeirence.

I want to go to a university, but to achieve this goal, I have to put forth effort my going to school and studying all the time. I am always doing something while I am in school, and I am not allowed to be on my cell phone. This will not help me pass in school, even after school I sometimes stay in tutoring for Math and English, because I have trouble. This will be true in school, sports, and in life like my mother tells me all the time. I have to agree that always staying busy will allow you to accomplish more in life.

In my school, soccer also helps me stay busy, because I am on the team. We have to practice everyday to have a chance to win. I want to be the best player that I can be, and to do this I have to always practice. My coach tells me the more I practice, and the busier that I am the better condition I will be in for the game. Soccer takes a lot of energy and you are always active in the game and you need to be more active than the other team to win. Always doing something in sports allows you to be better.

My mom told me when she was growing up that she was poor, and she did not always have food to eat so she picked mangoes off of the tree. She did go to school, but when she was not in school she had to always stay busy. She would go to her grandmother's house to wash clothes or sell some of the mangoes that she picked in the street. She was fifteen years old, and she had no shoes so she worked for rich people in their house cleaning. She tells me this so that I will understand that I have to stay active and she has worked hard to give me a better life.

We achieve more when we stay active, and we always are doing something good. My goals in life are to go to school, and graduate from a college, play sports to stay in condition, and make a better life for my kids like my mother.

Is it really true that Imagination is more important than knowledge.

Thesis

I honestly disagree with this knowledge is important.

Claims

Knowledge is more important than Imagination.

Can Imagination be helpful to you.

Imagination can happen to some people.

Knowledge is more important that Imagination

Knowledge helps your future become successful so how will Imagination help you. It wouldnt really help you just by seeing things with your head. Lets say you played would you rather would you rather have good knowledge or have Imaginations. Is there a way for Imagination to help you?

Can Imagination be helpful to you

Seeing things with your head wont help anything ,but it might help you if you think of anything it will just appear ,although, its not really there. Lets say you want a snow day you just Imagine its snowing outside but you still have school and theres not really snow there. Some people do Imagine things but why?

Imagination can happen to someone

A person starts to imagine things when he or she feels alone ,so he or she starts to think of an imaginary friend and they think that helps them not feel alone. Say that you just played your new game and you start to imagine in your head how fun the game was ,and what things you did in the game. Lets see what we learned.

Conclusion

Sometimes if they don't get what they want they will just stop trying; in school work or even homework. But in the other hand some other students will try harder so they can play or do what they love. So a (C) sounds good but a (B) sounds even better; so students like me could try even harder and have a modification to so. So I say to the principal great gob and keep it up. When we are looking back and when we have a great job that we like; we look back to middle school and say thank u for pushing us to max when it came down to doing work THANK YOU.,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,6.0,5.974635601043701,6
F05D3802BC94,"Last year, a student in my classroom was caught using his cellphone during class. He pointed out that the reasoning behind it was that he was searching something that involved the class, but the teacher still took up his phone. By allowing the use of cellphones in class many students would get even more distracted than they already are. It would also be easier to cheat and get good grades, since all the information would be of easy access. On the other hand, this would make the technological integration in school even better and easier, something that many dream and believe will happen in the close future. I believe cellular devices should not be allowed during educational time.

Initially, cellphones would draw too much of student's attention. Teenagers spend enough time of their day staring at screens, and school should be a place where that doesn't happen. Many are addicted to social media, and have the ""need"" to check it every 10 minutes. Sometimes when I am in class and decide to take out my phone, not looking and paying to the teacher for more than a minute makes me loose focus of class and need to ask the ones around me for help. Class is a place where students should focus and pay attention, by allowing the use of phones many would get distracted and use it for non-educational purposes which would make learning harder, since this focus should be used on what the teacher is saying instead of what their friends are posting online.

Secondly, it would be an encouragement to cheating. With the integration of cellphones in class students would start getting better grades, since many of them would simply Google all of the answers for a worksheet instead of paying attention to the class and answering it based on what they've learned. This would make so that daily grades get better, but when test day arrives, the student who Googled every answer in the past week would get a bad grade because he didn't really learn anything, all his answers were based on someone or something helping him. This would then encourage cheating, because that student would most likely realize that with the use of his cellphone daily grades were getting better, but when it came down to not using the device his grades would drop.

However, it could be helpful and very easy to set up. With limitations in place, like blocking certain apps and websites that have nothing to do with school, cellphones could be useful during educational time. Technology integration in schools is already happening, many give chrome books to students so they can use it during class, but these are expensive and getting one for every student is not always viable. Everyone has a cellphone so there would be no need for extra devices ,since phones have 1000 different uses, including many that could be of help during educational time.

The student from my classroom which was caught using his cellphone still uses it during class, he is barely passing that class and complains that the teacher is not explaining something correctly and that is why he has such low grades. But everyone knows the reason he is almost failing is because he'd rather stare at his cellphone screen instead of paying attention to the teacher. Cellular devices draw too much of teenager's attention and can also encourage cheating. On the other hand they can be helpful in the right occasion. I strongly disagree with the use of cellphones during educational time and believe they would cause more harm than they would help.",5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,10.0,8.67287540435791,9
64A8183557F7,"Should students graduate in three years?

Some school offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years. Students should graduate in three years because, they have more time planing what they want to do, they have more time to work and save money for college and they have more time to spend time with their family. To have ideas who they can do during that year.

Students should graduate from High school in three years because, some students don't know what career they want or they don't know if work or continue studying. In that year they can think and choose what they want. One of my friends graduated the last year of school and she stay at home because she doesn't know what career choose, so she just stay at home because she doesn't know what to study and can't find a job yet.

Some students after four years in High School, they take one year more to think and relax at home. That is why i think is a good idea just three years of High School. They can take that year to work and save money for college, if they want to. They can just start work to adapt to their new life or new thing that are going to learn. In a fact, student can graduate in three years of High School because is better for them. I think is better because it help those student that are more than eighteen to graduate not too old.

Some people think that students should not graduate from High school in three years because, they have less time, but they are wrong because, students can take the most important classes or they can take classes in the evenings. Some students take courses during the summers. Some students want to graduate early because have some goals that they want to complete. In the future there can be online classes for those who need extra classes.

In conclusion, graduate from High school in three years is a good idea because, students can start college or the work force one year early. Students have more time to search a good college and to prepare their thing. This is good for parents too because, they can go to the college that their son or daughter wants to go.

In this life nothing comes easy, you have to work harder to build something or what you have in mind, once you build what you got in your mind you still probbably not going to stop trying to build more than what you already have, because you already tasted hows it feel having much, so you keep going and build more and more only because you don't feel that what you got is enougth or you liked how is feel having much.

80EA2FC62525,"Dear employer of ....

Local companies and organizations allow students to explore certain professions like being a chef. Because the students can learn things like how to prepare specific foods, how maintain their area clean, and discover if that is the job that they really want to do.

One reason of why local companies and organizations may allow to visit them is because students can learn things like prepare specific foods. There is some kind of foods that are hard to prepare, but the student can from young age start to the basic things. For example; when you want to cook something there are specific rules you have to follow specially if you are working like the amount of species you need to add to the food, how much time is need to prepare the food in the exact moment or simple details as the portions of food for each plate.

Other reason of why local companies and organizations may allow to visit them, is to help students how to keep their area clean. Sometimes when students think about being a chef they are just learning to cook food, and it is correct, but they forget to keep their area clean. Here is when the local companies can teach them things like which kind of liquids are needed to clean specific areas of the kitchen like the stove, the floor, and the sink. Also not just to keep clean the kitchen, they can explain us what kind of clothes we need to wear in work and what we do and we don't have to bring to the work.

Last reason of why local companies and organizations can allow students to visit them because the students can discover if the profession that they pick is the one that they want to do in the future. The students needs to know all about the profession and experiment the advantages and disadvantages of the certain profession. For example; If the profession that the student pick includes routines that to the student didn't like as clean, or any activity that are not the best ones according the person, the student may change his opinion and find his future in other profession.

In conclusion, I think the local companies have to allow students to visit them, because is good that the kids from young ages starts to think about their future and being a productive person. Also pursue others in the future and makes opportunities for everyone.                ",4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,8.0,6.459798812866211,6

Although some say that my school should not adopt a four-day of school week and should not extend two hours of school day to conserve resorces and energy because we dont use our resorces and energy in vain , actually my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two school hours to conserve resorces and energy because we will have a better environment and we will administrate energy.

Those who believe that my school should not adopt a four-day of school week and should not extend two hours of school day to conserve resorces and energy have their reasons. One of the most disputed reason is that, our school does not use it resorces and energy in vain, beause we use energy and resorces to facilitate our studies and to have better opportunities to learn. And they also say that if we have a four-day school week wont make any change.

However, my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two hours of school day because we will have a better environment. According to an article written in my county says that, ""The used of resorces in my school has increased by 70%. Even more, it says that because the over abuse of resorces in our school the amount of trees cutted has enhace around our county and its harming our enviroment."" That is giving a bad reputation to our school and county because our school does not recycle and reused our resorces .

Also, my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two hours because we will administrate energy. The using of computers, smart borads, and all kinds of technological devices in our school have increased, do to the extraordinary amount of students our school possess. Our school has the biggest amount of students in all the county. So, do to the amount of students in our school the use of computers has increased. According to an save energy a webside, ""80% of schools energy is used in computers and other technical divises."" By having a four-day school week and extending two hours of school day will limited the used of computers and it will make our school better.

many people have say that my school should not adopt a four-day of school week and should not extend two hours of school day to conserve resorces and energy because we dont use our resorces and energy in vain. But as you can see adopting a four-day school week and extend two school hours to conserve resorces and energy will be benefial to our school and to our society.

Four years later, I met him at a restaurant and he was a whole new person, he dressed different and his personality was different, Generic_Name's influences in public schools changed him.

People's character traits are formed by influnces beyond our control because the enviroment that we live in takes a huge part on how we are, who we are, and how we act, and because of people like our parents that have guided us and influenced us throughout our whole lives, and while some people say that a person is able to choos who they are or control their character traits, the majority of the people in society live by other people's influences.

The enviroment that a person lives in takes a huge part on someone's character because; their culture, their religion, and the people they surroud themelves with, always have an impact on someone's traits; for example, a private christian school student might not have the the character traits as a public school student because the enviroments are way different. In conclusion people's traits are controled by influces beyond our control because people is always getting influenced on the daily regardless of what envioment they're in.

People like our parents are responsable for most of the character traits we have since they have been with us our whole life. They guide us everyday, and they teach us what is right and what is wrong. Most of the kids in this world look up to their parents or use them as a role model, and that controls a huge part of our character traits. In conclusion our traits are formed by incluences out of our control because our parents, who have been with us our whole life impact us every day with thei lessons.

Some people say that a person is able to control their character traits or choose who they are, because they are alone and they probably don't like talking to people or learning from people so; therefore they don't get influenced by anyone , so they start forming their character and they start being who they are base on only what they do.

Most of the people in this world are influenced by the outside since most poeple go to work everyday, go to school everyday, and talk to people everyday, thay are always getting something out of someone, it could be an advice or a lesson. I don't think many people are able to control their character traits on these days with social media, and things like that going on.

In concluison our character traits are controled by influences we can't control because the enviroment with live in always has an impact on us, the people we surround ourselves with have an impact on us and society in general has an impact on us. Moving forward i think it would be good for people to keep being influnced by the outside because we will get to know how everything works, and no matter who we are influenced by there will always be someone that will tell is if it's right or wrong.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,7.0,7.669305324554443,8
2B5F1309FD2D,"To start off, schools are for kid that want to learn. People like me get bored easily, I like to do fun activities that states on what are we learning. Also,many people get so tired at school and really want to go home. When they hear that school hours are going to extend, they'll freak out, I would too to be honest. Now, there is a question that I ask to my self,

Do I want school hours to extend?

I would actually disagree, because first of all, I do my best to make my parent proud. It is tough, but do it for my parents because I love them, what I do for them is enough that I get tire, speaking of that, another reason that I disagree is that I get tire easily. I am not lying, but any way, it is so tough to stay awake for 7 hours and use all of you brain energy. I am not going to stand having another hour to stay in school. But, I know some people think that it's ok to have more school hour, because it can help them to learn more of the subjects. But they can go a sleep at any moment, that why we need the rest of the hours to rest.

The other reason why I don't like the idea of having more school hours, is because we need time to do our homework. It's necesary to have the rest of the hours to do homework, because what if someone has so much homework, and they need the whole day to do it. It is wrong to put more school hours to make that person suffer. We need to have the rest of the hours to have students do their homework to do for the whole day. Besides, it is always good to have a good night sleep. Many student come in late because of after school stuff. Without the extra school hour, students come in their house not that late.

Finally, the last reason why I disagree to have more school hours, is because there is no reason to have more hours. Why have more hours, if we have enough hours for the teachers to teach. If we add more hours, we are just wasting time, not only for the students, but also for the teachers. It's a waste of time having another hour for nothing and teacher are just running out of ideas to get us ready for the SOL. I know that is a faster way to finish all the units quick, but theres alway time for everything, we don't need to rush with all the units. It just that we as young childern, we need to rest to have the most energy. I get it that the adults also wake up so early, but also they can just not have more hours to waste more of their time. Some teachers also need to care about their childern. Teachers also need more family time with their loved ones. If we don't need to extend the school hour, then the teacher don't need to extend their school hours.

One importan thing in this life is the attitude. Why?

Because the attitude represents your self ,that's means the attitude shows the person who you are.

Well with a positive attitude you can get all succes you want. How?

Be friendly, help each other, help the people who really needs help, alweys you have to be lowly, accept your mistakes, think good things and the most important alweys you have to smile so that's make you a person with a positive attitudes ,then that's how you can get the success.

Why we talking a lot about a positive attitude, because apositive attitude can change your life another example i can give you about this is ""A positive acttitude is like a broken tire, you can't go any were, you can't move if you don't change the broken tire'' so is the same in the life, if you don't be a person with a positive attitudes you can't be successful.

when an enthusiastic person fails, he try to find the way to do it better next time, in the way the person achieve a goal a the time.

I agree because now days all kids do is stay home and be on there phones and do nothing. I know that because I used to do the same thing before and i didn't like to do anything at all but then I started playing a sport and it help a lot but i think that. Participating in a extracurricular activity may help you by staying healthy, get you out of trouble,and get you in a good college.

one example is staying healthy by playing a sport you can help prevent a lot of things like maintain a good weight, and keep you from getting sick. Keeping a good weight is good for your health because it keeps you from getting other diseases,more than 1/4 of the people in the U.S. are obese. Why not start at a young age and prevent from being sick and other things. Another thing that can help is eating healthy, we can prevent sickness to in order to do that you might want to think about trying out a new sport.

Another example is getting you out of trouble you can avoid a lot of drama. I learned that social media can get you into a lot of trouble, half of the time a lot of the drama comes from social media. Maybe if you join a club or a sports team you can think before doing something that can get you in trouble. One time my friend made the soccer team but she got in trouble so they kicked her off the team and she learned from her mistake and never got in trouble again. When in your in a cub or playing a sports half of the time you don't have time to be in drama get in trouble.

Last example is joining a club, working on the year book,serve in the student council and, playing a sport can get you into a good college now a days colleges are looking to see if you have participated in any sports or clubs. When i graduate high school i want to go to college and a study to be a general surgeon and participating in a sport or joining a club can help me get into a college. You meed new people when you join new clubs and make new friend ships. When you want to go into a club or in sports do something that you like not something your friends like or something that can help you in life with.

In conclusion staying healthy,getting out of trouble,and going into a new college can help you when you participate in a extracurricular activity. staying healthy by playing a sports and eating healthy can prevent you from getting sick. Staying out of trouble can avoid a lot of drama from school and social media think before you do something your going to regret .

Although some say school should not follow four-day school week because students will not be able to learn as much as attending to school five days, actually schools should follow a four-day school week so students can have more time to rest and do homework.

Some say schools should not follow four-day school week because students will not be able to learn as much as attending to school five days. Attending to school four days will not be enough time for teachers to go through each lesson as for students to catch them easily. For these reason, students might not be competent when having tests, homework or other assignments. I think that not following a four-day school week is a good decision because students will learn more attending five days to school.

Actually schools should follow a four-day school week so students can have more time to rest. some students join activities after school such as soccer, volleyball, basketball and others. So, some times they have practice after school where they have to be there for like two hours. Basically, they get at home late where they might have homework to do or help their parents to do anything. I strongly believe that schools should follow a four-day school week in order to consider students.

Schools should follow four-day school week because students need enough time to complete their homework. In order to get good grades on homework, students should have enough time to complete it. However, when students do not do their homework , most of the time they do not do well on their tests. Homework help students to prepare for tests, quizzes, and it also help teachers to know if students are learning.

Although some say schools should not follow four-day school week because students will not be able to learn as much as attending to school five days, actually schools should follow four-day school week so students can have more time to rest and do homework.

59245E1C5BF0,"Students should be required to take an art class or an elective class. Students that attend an art class are more easy to express themselves, they know what they want, and they are more passionate doing their duties, and some students show a positive attitude. Art was created to entertain and show what we can learn from it. For some students art class is very fun because they share the same feeling, which is be creative and to know the meaning of art. Art can teach you many things and it helps you to be different to be unique.

First of all, an art class let the students express their feelings and every single student has their own way to express emotions, some of them pick music, some of them pick painting, some of them pick drama, etc. Besides, many students like to share what they are felling by writing music, painting or acting. When students show or express their feelings, it helps them to take away some weight on them. However, when a student attends an art class they are not only learning how to express how they feel, they also will learn what is art all about and how many roots it has.

Second, art makes student increase their abilities to choose and know what they want to have in the future, and what they already have in that time. Currently, many students do not know what they want, they do not know what path is the right one, they are undecided. The art class can teach students how to know what they want. It is easy like choosing one of the roots from the same plant such as music, painting, drama, or others like producers, designers and the art of build a building. It develops the way how student can see the world in another point of view.

In the other hand, we have the most positive students in the school, who are they? The art students. Giving the thanks to the art teachers and their subject, students feel more comfortable with themselves and they are proud of who are they. Students in art class can communicate and share ideas and thoughts in order to know each other. It helps students to be confident and trust in themselves. In fact, a student that is positive and confident shows passion like when they are working, doing homework, spending time with family, and friends everything they do is perfect. Another fact is that most students are more active, why? because of the way they live make them to have too much energy,so they are constantly moving they keep their minds busy.

Based on the reasons and the example I showed, it is easy to answer, ""Should students be required to take a class in the arts, or should such classes be electives?"" well, The students should be taking an art class. Some people might think that arts do no help like others subject such as math in science or English in government, but they are wrong. Art helps the attitude of the students if a student is bitter,foolish, and lazy he/she is showing that she/he does not care and will not do anything.

in our world doing something or being inactive does have a big impact i think that when you are in high school you ask your self if you want to be someone in this world or you think that by being inactive all day thats going to get you into something but thats not true we all know that god put us in this world to be happy even tho sometimes we dont behave like he would want us to and that is behave i think we all are going to be good that we are so ignorants that we dont look for him we dont realized the we need him he put us here to be good persons but we failed, i think that heaven is so beatiful that we all want to go there,but we dont deserve it we got to figth for anything that we want the we got to be so thankful with him that he remembers to wake up us every day that somethings we said that no body love us but thats not true he will always love us no matter what we do he will always want the best for us because all we have do is to served him and our lives for him because hi gave his life for us, and all we have to do is to fight for our dreams and accomplish want we want so thats why is better to be very active.

well my first reason about if we accomplish more if we are doing something or is being inactivity also served a purpose, want i think about this topic is we will always accoplish more if we are active because being if we are always doing something we would always get something,we will always get the results of what we do and if do good things god will bless us even more, that if we propose our self in doing something really big in our life all we got that do is fight for it and never give, you always need to be thinking positive and big because nothing is free, eventhough how you look like that does not matter for god you always have to be doing something to live and survive, and to be happy and thats what it will you a boost to fight for what you want you gotta believed in your self and have to know what you really want.

my second reason about is being you are always doing something do we accoplish more or if we inactive also has an porpuse what i think about this is the you decided about your life you have the key to life you only have to know how to use it,some people think that life is hard,but yes in some way they are right in this case some people made their life harder when they think that they can't and but they dont realize that they really can if they want to all they have to do is to have faith in god you always got to be thinking that you really can,and you got to pray god, and never get tired of praying to him because he will never be tired of you, and get people can't really do something is because they really cant and is not because they are lazy, sometimes people are very lazy and thats the porpuse why they dont do anything and that will never be a good idea being at home all day, because if you are at home all the time you migth be thinking of doing something bad and thats not good.

my third reason about if being always doing something will help you accoplish more of what you really wanted i and if being inactive will get you to something, i think that all depends how you use you time when you are not doing anything i seen people now days that they work in their house and getting a good money for just playing videogames so thats very important, being inactive is not going to get you to anything beause thats not gonna get you what you want because in this life nothing is free you always got to do what you really like because what it really matters is the if you are happy with your life, i think you should never give up always put you head up it dont matter where you come from what it really matter is what you are made of, in my case i want be a profesional soccer player and i have realized that being at home all day does not help a lot so now i trying to go and practice all day and the really is making me a better player thats why in have to work really hard.

In my conclusion about this topic is the in life you really have chances you ither used them or let them go, and that some people let go the opportnities that they have does same oportinies that others will want to have, people in this world always want more and more and that they have a lot of money but they are not happy sometimes they kill themself and all that is because they need god, because if you have god you will always be happy dont matter if you are rich or poor, life is about figting is not about giving up is about trying and i think that you should always try your best of you even if think that you can't you gotta believed in your self first and if you are doing more and more it will give you more succes in your lifeb insted of not doing anything because you have to survive and live happy you always have to have a porpuse for life because we are all worthy alawys be with friends that will tell you to do the right thing because does friends are really worth it so never give up on life always be happy and work really hard for what you want to be and make sure that you are happy and have in your mine the money is not all in this world, and look for god before is to late and be sorry with him because we all need him, and the fact the his coming soon, but being inactive will never help you a lot beacuse is not getting you nowhere, so you really have to used your time correctly and not wasted because life is very short, and if you dont get what you want just be happy with what you have.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,6.0,4.849049091339111,5
B0CD65C0DE1D,"I believed students could be beneficial with online classes because, many people are used to travel a lot to take a class on campus, but since there is a way to do classes. I think it's better for many people that travels from a far place to the college to study their career. For Example if a students travel for 2 hours to get to the campus or college that student would be taking a lot of time to his class on campus, Many students that are on campus are paying for apartment and books etc, But online there is a better way to finish classes for graduation.

However, many students are willing to make online classes because there is a lot of stress when they travel from their house to campus and many students are stock in traffic or if there is a accident many students are not making it to their classes although many students are willing to take online classes than on campus. my reason is since their is technology in this world on this days to take many thing online for example their job, online classes, or talking to professors that are on different part of the world now with technology there is a better way to study or finish classes for our good purpose. also their is a way to communicate with teacher via video conferencing and that another easy way to take classes other way to take classes and just with your teacher not having more students. when you are with the teacher you are able to ask questions and the teacher will answer the questions that you are asking and have knowledge of what the teacher is talking about on his class, Not like on campus that there is a class full on students and its harder to ask a question to the teacher or ask for his opinion on what the subject is, as you would be online where its more easy and online can learn more since you are with just the teacher.

As students we have many responsibilities on college when we are paying our classes we have to go and finish them, As online there is more time to be with your teacher and talk about what the class is. also many classes online are just an 1 and a half and online there is a power point for the students to see what going on on the subject and could be easier to know the class or the teacher can show the studnt how to do certain jobs that would help when tey start to get a job and not having to be desing with other stuffs to get the job that we are been studying for.

In conclution to my response many students are willing to pay classes online and not going to campus to study, but for many people they prefer go to campus and study and have more time stuying on library or in classes. my opinion is that online classes could benefial students who are working and studiying at the same time since taking classes online or at home since we have thsi technology have to uset for our own good an not wasted on other stuffs and here are the best ways to study online you can wake up and just open your computer and take your classes and then do a different class or go to your job or go into the campus to get the books that are needed to take the class.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,6.0,5.561556339263916,6

41641B53F554,"I am writing to support the idea that students have to choose or identify a caree beafore they enter high school.

First of all, I support the idea on students choosing a career before they get to start high school.

That wey they will know, what they like to be when they graduate from high school.

For example some students will became profetional sport players, architects, doctors, etc.

Because thinking on becaming some one very important in the society at a young age will make them proud of them selfs, and that woul lead them in to a succesifull pat.

Secondly, for young students will be easier to get to where they want at a youn age.

Because they are young, they don't have to think a bout anyting ells but studying.

For example they don't have to think a bout payin bills, or taking care of the family.

The only thing they have to worry a bout is studying, and follow their dreams to be what they want to be.

BC1F1C37721E,"Is it possible to impress someone at first time? Based on my experience I am extremely agree with this statement. It's possible to impress someone based on what we are, what we are doing, and what we want from them to do, because now days which everyone is fully educated and knows what is wrong or right, believes on their own. We can impress people towards our religion, towards our government party, and towards out country to visit.

We can impress people towards our religion by giving them the ideas of what is it about. How it will change up your future, how it will impact on your kids, how to treat with others, and also the idea of understanding someone better. Take them with us to the place where we practice our own religion, tell them the truth and advantages of it, and also show the religious cultures.

We could impress people towards our government parties to support us by voting us. Promise them that we would not let them down, we will accept their wants and help them to advice it, we will make their education department strong that everyone can get education, and we will make sure that we provide them their dream jobs after they graduate college.

We might impress someone to visit our country by telling them about the situation of our country, and tell them how cheap the things are. Show them the beautiful places, historical temples, culture, different kinds of foods, clothing, also about the rights of people.

To conclude, impression is something that people do for others to get their attention for a specific thing, such as impressing people to convert to their religion, motivating people to vote for a specific government and choose a good leader for their country, and also impressing people towards their countries situation to persuade them to visit their country.

113436EC45E2,"The philosopher Albert Schweitzer thought the example is not important and is not the main thing to influencing others, it is the only thing. Now the society thing different around the world many persons like the parents thing they need to give a good example their sons. the teacher need to be good example from their students at the school. Famous people like their fans sometimes they are under 12 ages. if the persons did not given to the new generation good example they can not be influencing good things in them.

The parents they are the best example for their sons, and daughter at home. Because at home sometimes is the first school for our child that can has, there we learn speak, walk, and who clothing you. Example: if her father is a drunk, and smoker what is a example him given to his sons. That would by influencing in her sons and can destroy the future of them. This situation happen in many family and children start to have problem with the authority. And is the bad example that their parents given to them . And is no only the things the parents give to her sons nevertheless they need more then a example, more then things like expensive clothes. and shoe many of them they need a parents that care of them.

The teacher after the father they are so important to give a example of respect, how can be responsible with our homework they challenge us , with no matter the obstacle is front of us we can do it many of the teacher support you in the situation of the school but they teach us who can we do our work when be adults and they start to explain many thinks that you dont know example: if you do something wrong they help us to find a situation like i math and they do not say bad thinks when you do something wrong because they respect you but we like a students need to do it too. And with this attitude is like a teacher can influencing in a student with the respect.

Leader is person that is caretaker of a group of people it is in the school, in a church in many places we can find one. This one example of who can be influences of a movement like in the church that person need to be example of his people than the people follow him or she. Example: always a leader need to support the people no the people to him. Because the leader teach them how can be a good leader and him give example of that like a good person,good attitude, friendly. etc. And with his example this is the person can influence the other person without things and inspire more person that one day them teach another

In conclusion, to be a examples is the main thing to be a influence in the world and any areas. i desaggres because i think for influence to another persons. So your must be the best example you can because one they more then one person will fallow your steps.

4351657CEC2F,"Do I agree with churchill""s statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? In my opinion I do agree with his statement because everyone fails at something in life. There's so many people that fail in the world and I definetly agree with churchill's statement because i think it really says a lot about life in general its not easy.

One reason is because I believe that everyone goes through some type of failure in life and I feel like that's the only way you learn from anything. I also think that people that fail are people that succeed at what they failed at. That's the only way you learn from anything for example people can fail at taking a test or playing a sport. Not everything people do the first means there gonna succeed which isn't always the case. I feel like when people fail that's when they can take the time and realize why they failed they learn from that mistake and the next time a oppurtunity comes for them to try again they can try there best and succeed. Trying your hardest is the best way to deal with a lot of things that's the only way to succeed in your best way.

Another reason I agree with this statement is because life isnt easy there are a lot of challenges your gonna come upon and all you have to do is try and if you fail the first time then there's always gonna be another oppurtunity around the corner. What I think churchill is trying to get at people is never give up and he's trying to say that it's okay if you fail the first time you try something there's always gonna be another chance to prove yourself and you can succeed at that goal or test you have in school or something like that. Iv'e failed many times in my life and on the second try i succeeded so churchill has a point when he says that it's okay to fail in life because thta failure prepares you to be better than you were the last time.

That is why I agree with this statement because i believe tha everyone deserves a second chance to prove themselves and what they are campable of. Churchill's statement should really speak to people and people should take it into consideration because there's always a time in life when you are going to fail and you are going to get a second chance at it again. I do completly agree with this statement because it makes you look at life and everything differently and in a better way that is why i agree with Winston Churchill.

53607F113053,"Although they say it is better to not try to redo things you already mastered then you will never grow,Actually it is better to retry something you already mastered,one example is you will have more experienced on the task your suppose to accomplish with. Another example is they would take you in as a responsible person.

One of the following examples I mentioned was how you will have more experienced on the task your suppose to accomplish because having that experience their is so many things that can get done. With the experience you can multitask. In today's society people around the world have their own jobs and work and from now then have experienced the job. For me when I got my first job I didn't have no experience I did not know what I was doing so they trained me from then I started getting the hang of it I knew from then what my job was to do. I've been working at Party City for a year already and I already have experienced even have the chance to become a manager from the store. All I know is that with experience things can get accomplished and turn out fine to the best things that get done.

Another example that i mentioned was they can see you as a responsible person and they know what rights and wrongs you can show them. A responsible person can show so many ideas or reasons for someone to be that good person they expect themselves to be. In today's society that we live in their is so many people all around the world who are responsible for their actions they know what is best. For example when it comes to babysitting one of my siblings its a huge responsibility to take care just like how my parents left them for me thats how they want to come and find them. It's my job for them to make sure they don't get hurt and for me to have the time to feed them and to please them from the things they want. My mother calls me responsible since I know that I love kids and its my job to keep them safe. Responsibility matters in society good things can come your way if you honestly see yourself doing big things that are right in life.

However the opposite of trying something you already mastered is ""If you don't retry something you mastered then you will never grow"" meaning won't get to accomplish what you could have accomplished more and wont experience new choices or things. The things that people in society do which in life it can come to a time that you have to redo something it is best to retry and if you don't it then you wont accomplish things meaning it wont take you nowhere cause you would forget other then that you wont get to experienced anything new that you couldn't accomplish.

Through out society we know that it's best to retry things and to keep completing the accomplishments that wanted to get done either it's best to keep building up more experiences and to be come responsible person or to not even retry to do the things you were doing before which they would not get you nowhere. Through out life it's a big chance which you can see yourself happy and from then having a smile on your face. People even complementing you about how well done things you accomplished. What I believe in is to never give up to retry things that were done before and that it can still be redone no matter what day it is in life, it's always better to accomplish then to not even try.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,7.0,6.232189178466797,6

Although some schools offer says that distance of learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because there are 50% of students that prefer take classes online and they don't come to the school. I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because if they stay at home, they will have more time to spend with their family or make things that they would like to do. And students who stay at home they will have more time to studied another signature like math or they can learn another language. They can practice a sport or they can do whatever they want. If you take a video conferencing this will help you to understand your teacher because a video conferencing explain you what you need to do. And also you will see what is your teacher teaching you.

Reason 1, why students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because if they take classes online they will finish school more early. for example some classes online are more shorter than a school year. School year require have 315 days of classes and you have to be in the school for about 6 to 8 hours per day. And also they need to complete some credits to graduated. If you want to finish school you have to complete this credits. To have complete this credits you have to take some classes that are require to complete those credits.

Reason 2, why students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because if they studied at home they can go to doctor's appointment. There are 70% of students that doesn't come to the school because they have doctor appointment and they mostly are absent. Attendants is very important in the school because if you want to have good greats you have to come every day. If you take classes online you will have the capacity of learn more faster and whatever test that they give you online you'll available to past them.

Although some schools offer think that distance of learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would benefit at some students that choose studied online or by a video conferencing.

F54386A8122B,"Today i will be discuss if it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? most may disagree with this statement, but i will hopefully grab your attention and hope you could agree with me.

I think it is a good for students to decide on there career this early because number one in today's society everything is depended on technology. What are students into nowadays there phones, video game, IPads , computers, etc. So pretty high advanced technology is everywhere, My point that i'm trying to make here is that the majority of students get either there phones or computers at a young age. So in my opinion i think that there future is set way before high school. But again my point here is that yes i do agree that careers should be set when they enter high school.

With entering high school students are introduced to a lot of programs at the start of there new journey to life. theres programs in high school that take students to colleges and take them on tours or they either tell the what to major on in that specific college, With planning early for your future you save time for stressing out last minute. I feel like this shouldn't just be small societies making students plan really early this should be the whole nation because as students we are the future of the united states so why not start 4 or 5 years ahead. Although some people may say that this is a huge distraction only because students would want to just focus on the future instead of focusing on whats happening right now.

So the main argument is that I 100% agree with students choosing there careers at a young age. My main reason is that the early the better with chances of programs and guidelines to help you on your way to a better education theres no way that you can stress for a career. in addition to my statement I also think that schools should have a bunch of programs helping students out with there future that way they won't stress there last year of high school, and they won't have to apply to colleges not knowing what to do.

65DBDD75CA50,"Jonh once said, Technology had positive and negative effects on people's life, people complete many tasks without having contact with others. Some people said that technology is good because they can do many thinks, like find books, information and do works more easy. Other people thinks differents, they said that technology is bad because had negative effects on people life, if people do not know how to use it, they can will have problems because sometimes people send archivements or informations to the wrong person or publish it. I think that technology is bad because with technology we can do many thinks, but some people use technology for hacks, steal acounts and cheat persons.

First, some people said that the technology is important in this era, because is more easy to do many thinks,

for example, search specific information more fast.

To do homeworks or company works with more information and explanations make projects, glide planes or to find books and work without think a lot.

Second,the technology is very important to some people, because many times they used it to do they works and make some project, the technology in this era provoked many wrong thinks, it created many electronic thinks that are advanced.

However, the technology caused many problems, the people are using the electronic thinks a lot, the cellphone, video games etc. It are creating a obsession in the people, many kids and adolocents have problems with they vision, because pass a lot of time in the cell phone, computer or playing videos games causing cancer, tumor or lose their vision.

Finally, the obsession that technology are creating is very worrying, many kids don't do the homeworks, the students text in class and do not put attention, other persons driving texting causing accidents. Some parents permit that they kids use technology, but they do not have the contol of them the adolecents use technology for have fun sometimes causing problems. Today in this era the technology are advancing and provoking that people do not learn and sometimes it cause the death, persons use technology sometimes to hacks acounts and steal informations, photos or they publish inappropriate photos in they acounts causing bullyng or making the person feels bad. Also, the technology is very advance that the people are creating robot to make more easy the works, but is is a ploblem because the robot will be remove the people jobs, causing that the people leaving whithout job.

In conclusion, the technology had negative effects on people's life, creating obsession on people and doing more easy the ability to do works,but for people tha use technology a lot need to have a limit, and if they have acounts with important information they need to protect it with a strong password, if they have kids and permit that use technology they need to control them what they do and put a limit how much can use the computer, cell phone or videos games. people have to put their own limit to control technology when it cause problems.",2.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.419003009796143,5
1DDC2D1DB4EE,"Dear principal, I'm writting this letter to let you know my opinion on the idea of change the school lunch menu into a new healthier menu. I think that it would be a good idea change the lunch menu to be more healthy because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, can help students to stay healthy and could encourage the students to begin eat healthier.

Students consume unhealthy food on school alsmost every day, change the menu into a healthier will help students to consume less unhealthy food. Eating unhealthy food daily could damage students in many differents ways. One this ways is that could bring students diseases such as heart problems or could cause obesity in a young age. Additionally change the menu could not just be benefical for students it could also help teachers and personal staff as well to consume less unhealthy food daily.

By having a healthier menu could help the students to stay healthier because they will be eating the proteins that they needed to develped better. Also this could help students to do better in things such as sports, and their respectives classes on school. Another advantage of this menu is that will give students the opportunity to try something new instead of having the same food that they're had been having year over year. In addition by doing this could migth make students realize that having this menu is not just to force them to eat food that they don't like, instead is to keep and them stay healthy.

Even thougth that some of the students will migth think that this would be a bad idea because will eliminate some of their favorite food, I think it will be helpful for them because by doing this will encourage them to begin to eat healthier, because that could help them now and on the future. Also this could encourage them to covince their friends and family to begin to eat healty because this could prevent them from having a disease just for eating unhealthy food.

In conclusion I think that change the school menu into a new healthier lunch menu is a good idea, because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, could help them to stay healthy and could encourage them begin to eat healthier. Those are the reasons that make me think this way, I hope this letter could help you decide that implement this plan is a good idea to change the school for better. Thank you for you time, dear principal.",3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,7.0,6.818739891052246,7
FB73ABAB1D14,"Students should have the right to elect their classes that they want to take in school, because it's all about in how capable the students are or how much the students can learn if they have the chance to elect their classes. It's hard for some students to learn a class that it have been given to him/her. Some students are born with special skills, they can handle many things at the time but not all the teenagers and the kids have the same ability. People should think more about just giving students classes without consulting with them about what their class are going to be. Some student might not have the skills that are needed to take the class that it has been given or the student might struggle with the class that it has received, because they didn't had the chance to tell their teachers or parents what they were capable of.

However, students should be allow to elect a class they feel more comfortable of in their school, and all the schools should be aware of letting students pick the classes or activities that they want to do or they want to learn more about, because It has been proved by scientists and experts, that the ninety-five percent of the majority of the students who elect their classes have become successful in their education path because, students have developed different types of skills that are based in a careers that they want to do in their future, that it became easy for them to manage after all the experience they have gotten, after choosing something they liked while being in school.

The majority of students do not consider music or drama classes important for their education, it's something that you are inspired by to do. Music, art, and drama these classes can be a distraction for students not to focus in their school work and it might affect their education status. Most of the students from the age of ten years and up are still developing their brains and they can get easily distracted. Most of the parents in the

U.S they won't let their kids watch TV for more than thirty minutes, because they can create a habit and they will spend more of their time watching TV, playing video games and more.

In addition, for those students who are forced to take art or drama classes etc, this choices can lead teenagers or kids to fall into a level of depression, for not having the chance pick something they like to do in school. Parents and school teachers should let students know that they can also practice any sport in school, this method would keep students exercise and healthy. Overall, students should have the last word of what they want to learn in school and parents should be aware of that.

In my life experience, I have become successful in the things that I have done while being in school, because my parents always told to pick something that I would like from school, and I choose to practice sports and after choosing something that I considered good for me and my future, I received an scholarship for soccer. All this happened after my parents gave me the opportunity to decided what it was good for me and my future. I completely disagree with the people believing that students should be require to take music, drama, and art classes, because all of this might take all the good opportunities away from your child and it will become a distraction for them.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,7.770733833312988,8
4A5FFF41E5E7,"Theirs are many enjoyable educational activity to do in a play. The best one and enjoyable activity is Singing. Singing can give you more energy and happiness. Sometimes singing gives you less stress. And singing can gives you more ideas or advices

First, singing can give you more energy and happiness because its reminds your favorite moments with someone. Singing have very strong powers and can do everything for example people cry when someone is singing a sad song because its remind them someone they lost or loved. Singing can make you more happy and makes your day better.

Second, reason is that singing gives you less stress because its relax you and calm you. You can even express yourself how you are feeling or what do you think just singing. And even makes you to think clearly when you are working hard.

2D3E794C5206,"Our world if full of a lot different people from around the world. And we all have different goals and diffrent ways to see our life. Thoma Jefferson wrote ""Determinenever to be idle..it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" as

I read this quotes

I strongly believe that we acomplished more if we are always doing something. if everyone would think the same way we all can reach beyond more. Students now days they don't have a lot of goals or motivation in life .And if we determine ourself to keep going; we will succeed in life. Attending collegue or always being involve in daily activity such a yoga clases, painting or being involve in afterschool programs. It will determine us not to be worthless.

First of all,as we finish HIgh school we all should attend college . And keep our education going beacuse the more knowledge we get the smater we are. I personaly feel that i acomplished more when I focused on reaching my goals.

As a prepare myself to graduate this year from High School. Im looking forward to go to colllege to study Early childhood. Attending college is going to be one of my biggest dream. And looking foward to become a professor. The key to sucess is to work hard.

Sencondly, being involve in daily activities give people joy and feel motivate. Some people loves helping in after programs or during school. As we get involve in this activies; we acomplish a lot by helping people that they need and also it helps us humas to be better for our community. My sister helps an afterschool program that helps the little kids to do their homework and some crafting project . She shares with me that working on this gives her gratitude and is helping her on the career that she is studying. Persuing this goals brings us pleasure because we are helping others.

At the end, the sociey we live in today, we all think and act differently but, if we all implement the quote the Thomas jefferson wrote; we will be living a a complety different planet. It is admirable how much it will be done if we are always doing something. We don't see how much this changes impact our daily life until we impliment them. I feel that attending to college while working is a great choice because it can help persue peoples dream and accomplish more in life. ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,6.0,5.574451446533203,6
8C54215E9E81,"In this society many people have many dreams and goals that they want to accomplish. There is a lot of people that wants to reach their goals, also their dreams, but they don't want do anything about it. People just stay there thinking what they want, and how their goals can impact their life. They think things will come along the way just by hoping, but the truth is that you have to work hard for what you want and always do something about it, that is how people accomplish their goals and dreams:therefore,people to reach their goals they always has to be able to have a strong and positive aptitude and believe in their self. Even when it gets hard not giving up in what they want.

First, to accomplish goals and dreams people always have to be doing something. For example, if someone wants to become a doctor they have to study, go to a University get their degree, and they have to at least a part-time job that provided their daily basic. It might be hard because people may not have enough hours of sleep since they have to study and do their homework overnight and work overnight too, but they don't give up because they know what they really want, they don't leave dreaming in a future, they are living building(doing something) a strong future.

Secondly, People has to have a strong and positive aptitude to reach their goals. For example, even when things gets hard in their way, They won't stop because they have a positive aptitude knowing that soon or later things will get better and at the end they will see their hard work, and how worth it was to work hard for what they wanted. That is the aptitude people needs to have to be able to accomplish their dreams.

Finally, Believing in yourself is very important. Imagine people working hard, and doing what they have to do to reach their goals, but having issues in believing what they can be capable of. That is an issue because to be able to reach there goals and dreams they have to believe that they can do anything they want in life, while the people that, believe and have a positive aptitude they have the ability to reach more opportunities in their life because, while believing and working hard there is more chance to accomplish more in life. This two combination of positive and believe is a power weapon in life, that will help you keep going and not stop, and every time you want to accomplish more and more.

In conclusion, when people work hard and always do something and while believing in what they want they have more chance to reach their goals comparing, to those who don't believe and don't do anything about it and they leave by hoping that one they will reach their goals. In the world they are a lot of dreams to make come true. People needs to work hard to accomplish them;however, people decide to stay calm and the way things are, just because they think is okay to take things easy and calm. When people really want something they work for it, they try and give their best in order to have what they want, and that it is the way how they accomplish their goals in life. The more people do, the more they accomplish.                          ",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,6.0,7.348254680633545,7

A7627F0E8E33,"When a problem occurs, do you try your best or do you simply not care? Problems are a common thing and happens to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. An example to a problem is that you have a scholarship to a great university that is far away, but your family needs you to stay close and help them. Some things may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, you'll try hard to fix it. There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you , it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best.""

Problems happen to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. Many people take their time when they deal with something troubling, they all have their different strategies too. They all have one thing in common they do what they think is best for them. They try to see if it will help them and what they could use to an advantage to be better. you would never do something to hurt yourself on purpose, you will need to think things through to see the outcome. Sometimes things do not turn out how you want to be, and you learn more about the things you will do to make things easier.

There are times that problems involve more than one person, and won't effect you only but others as well. It can be friends, or family, it could even involve people you don't know.

An example is that you got a great scholarship to the university of your dreams, but your family doesn't want you going far away and need your help. your education is at risk, but your family needs your help. You'll have to see what outcome there is to both of the situations and what is better for your future. Not all problems have an easy choice but they bring out the best in you and help will help you in some way, they build your character.

Some problems may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, and you'll try to fix it. There are problems that make it seem that you can't handle it alone. There are people that can help you, you're never alone. Even if you try your best it may not be how you want it to be, there are others who will help guide you, to have a good outcome. All you need to do is stay focus and look forward, so that you can keep your head up. You never have to do anything alone, you might need the help of others and it's okay to do so.

There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. It happens to the best people and there is no way to stop problems from coming. It doesn't matter the size of a problem, you should never underestimate them. You have to try your best when a problem presents, sometimes what seems right can turn out very wrong. You need to think if others will be effected, you can't just ignore a problem sometimes it could become bigger. It is also a chance that you could show others that you know what you are doing, after analyzing a problem you do what is best.

You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you, it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best.""

No matter what you should always try your best, not only when a problem comes up. We should show our best when problems come up due to the fact that sometimes there are problems that can put you in danger or hurt you. You can't prevent problems from happening but you can have less you you do things correct the first time around.

Some classes help the students to give the credits that they need for can graduate, and the electives classes help to give the credits that they needed for can pass. For example the electives clases that can give the credits are:

Art Fundations.

Dance.

Intermediate Band.

Chorus.

And another classes, if the students can study this classes this classes is the very help for can pass our school year.

In the school we have many classes that can help for it, but some times the students don't like the elective classes, and when the students have this classes they skip the class, is for this reazon that they fail the class, and they can't take the graduation because they don't have the necesary credits on they school record.

Also Army is a greate elective class, but no everybody like that, for the shoes, anothers is for the jacket, another for the pant, but anyways the school have many classes or things that they can do for can help every students to can pass they school year.

For example:

I have art class and I really don't like art but this class can help me to pass my school year and the teacher is very nice he always has a very patient with the students and never he was angry.

So, the elective classes not always is bad is just that the students don't like study and they don't want to be succesful for can pass, they want everything easy.

If the students want to graduate we need to be respectful, be ontime in the classroom, do the homeworks, snapshot, and every thing that the teachers say, fallow the rules of the school, be sossiable with others students and go to every classes not skip, and if we do every of this things we can be a very good students on the school.

7FED050A6D55,"Did you know that Robotics is the most funnest job than any other jobs out there? what I like to pursue is doing Robotics because it's all about coding and building.

Another reason why Robotics is a job for me to pursue, because it's all about coding. Furthermore, coding is basically you have to type in the words specifically. For example, Forward = (1). That means it tells the robot to move forward only one time. Also, coding is like math, you have to calculate what distance is the Robot is going to do and where it want to stop.

Another reason why Robotics is the one thing that I'd like to pursue is Building. Building the Robot is where you have to work with a team to make it happen, if you were to build it by yourself, it would take a long time to make, since it's only you and not 3 or 4 people helping you. Building is like Lego, but you have to screw in nuts, and not connecting them together like plastic bricks. Also, building the robot is most important, because if you screw something up, you have to remove every part of the robot to fix that one mistake you did.

B9F6B348FC3A,"In my experience I don't disagree, that Emerson thing that mastered will never get him grow.

First reason, all people get mastered and that stop them to grow in something that they tried to do,For example if you are doing like your own job, and you are the manager you will see all the product that you are selling is going down, and you job it's not going well, of curse, you will be in unless to try sell other product and your stored that will happened to you and you stored that you will fell terrible and you will you not valuable to continue in you job because you are so tager to see that you job is going down not going up.

Second reason, Mastered is like you are in favor of something and your friend fight to tell you that you are round with what are you trying to do, After your friend try to tell you that you was so round you undated that you was round, them you tried to do the thing right but, you are you get in mastered and that make you to not have other change to tried again, everyone are unless to try something that they already mastered and, something for example you are teenager and you are is school and you did a test and you get bad scored of curse you feel so bad and you will no tried to retake your test again that having mastered .

Third reason, being scared to try again something that you love and that you thing if you try again that will be a same way that you did the first time, but went you try again, you will have more experience because you will try to not get the same mistake that you got first time, and will have to look so careful to not get the same mistake because you have more experiences. we all can do the thing many time the thing is that you have to believe in you,

and you will look that you will grow not matter how hart and, how many time you get upset, you have to be positive and to be screed if already have mastered.

Conclusion,It's that you never give up at what are tried, not matter how many time or change you take you feel that you get in mastered you always will have other change to start and trust that you can believe that you can do it because that's all that you need to start again.

Scientist Albert Einstein is trying to compareing about which is more important imagination or knowledge but he said to himself that Imagination is more important than knowledge so i disagree because it not right imagination is not gonna help these kids being smart.

3. Scientist Albert Einstein is trying to help these kids to be smart,but i don't think i agree that imagination is right because i just think that imagination can show you some images about like your just making a car right now, so im just gonna said maybe imagination is more important than knowledge maybe i said..

4. Imagination probably is more important because it might sometimes show you images about something that your being smart something like that but i can't figure it out, being knowledge is more important but i guess not.

5.

I should be select as one of the students that can go to the company because it will show me more about the job that I am interesting on, I will know more about what steps I need in order to get the job, and it will show me where am I be working on.

The first reason why should I get select as one the students that can visit the company is because it will show me more about the job that I am interesting on. Knowing more about the job that I am interesting on could help me decide if I am going to get ready for it. Working and not knowing about the job could get the employee in some issues. I read recently about an employee who was working in a company, he didnt know that much about his job and what causing a lot of issues in the company, as a result, he got fired because he took the job without knowing about it. Nevertheless, If I get select as one of the students that can visit and explore the company will show more about the job that I want and while I'm working, I will know what am I doing.

Another reason why should I be select as one the students is because it will show me what steps I need to get the job. knowing more about what steps I need could help me choosing what classes in order to get the job. One day, my mom told me that when she was in High School, she went to visit a small company because she was interested in a job, she started applying but she didn't know that the company was requiring at least 3 math classes. My mom, who took only 2 math classes in High School, didn't get the job because she didn't know that she needed at least 3 math classes. If I get select as one of the students that can go and visit and explore the company will show me what steps I need in order to apply for the job, and I will know how many classes I need in order to get the job.

The final reason why should I be select as one the students that can visit and explore the company is because it will show where am I going to be working on. Knowing where are you be working on is an important thing because depending on where, you will apply for it. One day, my friend Generic_Name told me that he applied for a job at the Zoo, Generic_Name, without knowing where he was going to be working on, got the job, but after a couple weeks later, he quit the job because he did not know that he was going to fit the shark. If I get select as one of the students that can visit and explore the company will show me where am I going to be working on. working in a bad place can make the employee unhappy.

Some people may think that visiting and exploring companies is a wasting of time or they just apply for any job that gives money, but working in job that people dont like wont make you stay that long. However, If I get select as one of the students that can visit and explore the company can show me if am I going to like the job, it will show me more about the job that i want, the place where am I going to be working on, and whether should I try to apply for the job or not.

In conclusion, I should be select as one the students that can visit and explore the company because it will show me more about the job that I am interests on, What kind of steps I need in order to get the job, and where am I going to be working on.",2.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,5.0,6.427956581115723,6

there for is a bit concerning about how kids change there characters just because they dont fell good about them selves and have a lot of thinking inside of them the traits that you carry will have a dominance over them but i dont think that its best answering the question there for do actually they take control beyond our control.

There for it will be not always the case between how other view your things and traits makes you in insecure how other people see you and you change to make your self better than our parents gave us something we just got it from society like there is a lot of influences in the internet and more things that can go far behind the imaginable and they are not controlled by anyone they are just more likely to have more influences beyond there control but there is a lot of influences in this world you just got to find the right one for you and stick with it general likely there is more change in society for different perspectives.

Secondly there is a possible out come that you everyone can get out of this, just like other people that change there perspective at looking at things there for i should say that i have changed a lot since i got here in Virginia and am adapting to being normal well the normal way of being normal for other people there are influences beyond our control because what you see on the internet you will want to mimic it one day like there is a lot of rapers talking about 'girls, god there is a it of are influences in our daily lives always hearing what a rapper did or what type of things he is going to do there for its a bit concerning about all that because for a person that just moved here is a lot of change there is a lot of people that influence almost all the world in California there is where i lived all the artist and musical players and all of them have a purpose of having more people being influenced by them and making a lot of money if they get a lot of attention from a lot of people.

There is kids just like adults that get influence by others there is a possibility that we choose our own ideas of being influenced that are out of our control we choose to be this way we choose our path always they follow what we want there for i am proud of the world we live in.

There is a posibility that new things come out every year new things that 'kill' us or maybe other things like war and most of the things happening to our world and more polution and more virus that want to kill us and it is being more influenced by others to be scared of it becasuse you could die from that there is a lot of thinnking behind every smart influences.

Most people agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, and others don't. The people who agree say that learning new techniques helps you achieve your goals in life; however, it takes time to achives thoes goals. Most say that learnig new things can help you understand thing better.

I do agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson,because learning new things helps you expand you mind, so you can teach others.

learning new techniques is good for us,beacause it helps us understand things better. If you understand thing it make it easier to work on anything. Everything we do we had to learn and understand how do it or use it. Just like playing a sport you have to learn new techniques and practice thoes techniques to get better. Me personally I play a sport and i had to learn new things and practice so I can get better on playing that sport. Learning new ways to do things is healthy for the brain, so its easier to do any task. We all learn things so we can teach people new things and ideas on how to do things.

Teaching others can help us learn too. Teaching others new techniques helps them work better and see things differently. We all learn new things everyday, and we teach people new things too. Most people likes to teach others, but don't like to learn new things. Teaching other can help you have more confidents and more energy to learn new things form others. Teachers at every school teach students new ways to solve things. Some of the students teach other students or maybe sometimes other teachers. Learnig something that is beyond on you have already masterd is good, because others can look up to you and ask for advice. We can all help each other learn new things and make the world abtter place.

Ralph Waldo Emerson, believe that learnig helps us grow emotionaly and mentaly. Most of us agree with him, and others dont. Learning is very important and by learning we can teach orthers. New techniques help us understand things better and teach. Some sports are easy play and learn while others are hard to learn and play. Every sport we play we al have to learn and practice new things. Just what Ralph Waldo Emerson said if we dont learn we won't grow. Thats why I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Other people think, that influence to the children with bad thing not is good because they can learn thing bad in yours life. However, this can cause problems in the children because they learn bad influence of the person older and have bad record for yours future.

Children learn bad influence of the person older. for example, when a children see to parents smoking or drunk they learn the that parents make. have bad influence is when a person have bad behavior and bad behave.

Many person learn bad influence since children because the parent not the educate good and not the learn good thing.

Two years ago,in 2017,me and my best friend,Generic_Name,are ready for our first day of middle school. We were excited to see each other,we were excited because Generic_Name moved 3 years ago, in third grade. I was sad at first but until my mom say that they move not that far,my mom takes me to his house every weekends. Now when we start school i gonna see him every day. It because we have the same class and i was happy we have the same classes together. When i got to school i see Generic_Name in a far distance and start running to each other like we never seen each other before for a very long time. Now we start learning classes together every day

We where in English class to do a act of kindness to your best friend or closes friend. I say i was gonna do with Generic_Name,but then Generic_Name mom called him from the front office to pick him up. i said to Generic_Name what going on,he said ""i dont know"". soon after he didnt came to school for four days i was getting worried if his family are okay. i called to him many time,but he did not answer. until Monday he came to school looking sad, i said,""what happen"",he said that his grandma was very ill and might not make it .I felt sad too because his grandma was like my grandma. She been treating me like i was her grandson. Soon my mom took me to see the grandma to see if she okay.

Once i got home from visiting the grandma of Generic_Name,i was thinking what should i do to cheer up Generic_Name and his family. I was thinking for a full one hour,and then i was thinking why not buy them presents for the family. So on Sunday i went to the Nike shoe store,Walmart,target,and shoppers when i got there at Walmart i was thinking,"" what should i get for the mom and dad"",While i was thinking i went to the Nike store next to Walmart to buy his older brother air force one,that cost about $299 dollars. I said why am i spending money on expensive stuff. Then i went to target to get a $50 dollars gift card for Generic_Name and his little brother. So in total it cost me $100 dollars. Then i went to buy balloons for the grandma, it say,""god is here to protect you"". Right after, i went back to Walmart to buy a vase that cost me $42. Then i went to shoppers to buy flowers that cost $40 dollars because i got a lot of flowers to put in the vase.

On Monday we went to Generic_Name house to give the family gifts. First i give the shoes to the older brother,he seems really happy about the shoes. then i give Generic_Name a gift card as well as his little brother. Then i gave the mom a vase with flowers in them. then they ask me how much was it. i say almost about 432 dollars. They felt bad at first but i told them i had more money. Then i went to the hospital to visit the grandma to give her the balloons. She said thank you and bless your happy life.

i was crying when she said that. So after that we went to church to pray and pray. When me and Generic_Name got pick up it was good news that the grandma live.

0546517E6BAA,"When we make our own decision , we are creating our own world. People should make their own decision than be guidance from experst and authorities because they can't grow like a person by it-self. If they are guidance from experts or authorities they can't develop their own knowledge. That not help then because they are depending by other people and they can't never try something different by it-self. I agree with people who make their own decision because they build a self-confidence, learn be independent, and develop own skills.

When people make own decision they build a self confidence. One example of build self confidence is that we can believe in our self in what we can do. another reason is that we can feel confident by making our own plans. last reason to build our self confidence is that we have the ability to create our own future by making good decisions. Taking our own decisions always help us to feel confidence because we feel like a responable person in each decision maked.

Taking our own decisions helps us learning to be independent. One reason is that we learn to work by our self by making the decision to create our own businees without be guidance from a experts. Another example is that we learn to get up by it self, when we fall down by a bad decision. Last reason is that we have the right to do better if we get something wrong in our lives by a bad decision. When we make a good decisions by our self we feel independent because we are learning to live by ourself.

The people who make their own desicion, they are developing own skill. When we take own decision we are improving our knowledge becuase we are understending about what are the good decision and bad decision.

Last reason is that to make decisions also help us growing like a person because when we take decisions they make feel us with confidence that we are people with great capacity to do anything.

C0665B1D1449,"Self-esteem comes from learning. We as students should be self-confident in order for us to learn. Teachers and staff are giving all their help to help students achieve in life. Although many people argue both ways, self-esteem is a learning achievement because students are putting their best effort to achieve, students need to keep trying even if it is a struggle to learn, it is better to try instead of not trying.

Admittedly, ""It has been said"", that self-esteem comes from achievement and not from our praise. For example, during my freshmen year of high school I struggled a lot. The reason why I struggled so much was because I was not putting my best effort. I was a good student, the only problem I had, was that I did not like to learn, did not enjoy paying attention in class, or listening to the teachers. However, during the second semester of my freshmen year I started to pull it together and started paying attention in class. At the end of the school year I was able to have my grades how I wanted to have them and ended up passing all my classes with all B and one C. Yes I believe I build self-esteem and achieve because this was a learning process for me.

In addition, many students in America are struggling in school right now. ""Many people around the world say that the only reason why students are so harmful to their education"", is because students are not trying to learn. However, I agree because I went through the same problem, but not trying is another word that people don't enjoy hearing because is describing failure in life. otherwise, if we don't try is also impacting many people lives and also the student education.

However, many people believe that self-esteem comes from praise and not from achievement. I believe self-esteem comes from achievement because it is better to try instead of not trying. But many people disagree with my reason. Many people say that if students keep trying something they are not good at it just causes frustration. In many ways I disagree, because if students try to just listen there is a better chance to get better at it. Instead of wasting time and not learning. I witness my cousin going through the same problem because he did not try and was to lazy to just listing. This is why I agree that self-esteem is an achievement because people learn from their past.

In conclusion, I learn that self-esteem is a learning process because it made me become a better person in life. Also I achieve many goals like, not giving up, to keep trying, and push my self to do better. Therefore, self-esteem is not about having praise is about achieving and the mistakes students made during their schools year.         ",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0,8.0,7.716670513153076,8
A5A1A5D8D2B6,"Should schools control student involvement in extracurricular activities to enrich students' educational experiences, or should the decision regarding it to students and their families? This prompt is asking whether it is beneficial for students to enrich their educational skills when schools or their families control their involvement in the activities. Schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities because they can motivate students to work harder to improve their abilities. Also, students can learn many new things when involved in fun activities. Schools are beneficial, which they help improve students' skills.

Actually, schools prompt students to work harder to enrich their knowledge and skills because they can go to college and become successful. For example, the student who is bad at every subject at school is having hard time finding an opportunity to pursue and succeed. Her school profoundly thinks of her lack academic skills and chooses her to play a sport she wants. Later, the student finally become skillful or master at the sport, and she succeed due to her hard work. Schools can encourage students to keep working toward their goals and achieve them.

In addition, students can learn many new things when they are involved in extracurricular activities. Schools help them to expand their knowledge and improve their educational abilities. For example, the students are involved in activities such as computer programming camp, volunteering at community places, sport, or planting trees. The activities may help students to learn new things and find their interests easily, and it will be easy for students to decide what to study in college. Some people believe that students have a little time doing their homework and possibly getting bad grades at school. However, that is not the case because schools enrich students' educational skills, and students now learn how to manage their time finishing their homework efficiently.

In conclusion, schools should control student involvement in activities outside school because they help students to be motivated to work harder to improve their skills in school and other activities. Additionally, they can learn new things to expand their knowledge, and they know what they can do in the future. Schools that are controlling student involvement help students to enrich their educational skills, which they can go to a good college and succeed.

744C96D9BE0B,"Active or Inactive?

As a person or as a community we should always be doing something or just be inactive. If a person is being active and doing something all the time you are most likely to accomplish a activity or job. Some people believe that being inactive sometimes doesn't hurt and can cause less stress or you don't have to rush everything. I believe if you set a goal you have to do something to accomplish your goal.

First reason you accomplish more being active is, when you want a goal in life you will try to reach it and find ways to accomplish your goal. Once the goal is set you just need to know how will you accomplish that goal. Nothing is impossible in this world. For example, if you wanted to became president of the United States you will try hard to get into college, study, and be productive in life. Or if someone propose their self a goal to lose weight, that person will do some type of activity to lose some pounds and reach their goal. In general everyone has a goal or purpose in life and by doing the smallest things you are able to accomplish soo much tasks.

Another reason why being productive can help us accomplish something is because, the fact that you are being active can help us mentally and physically. For example, if a person is not mentally stable or emotionally stable, by someone else helping this person go out and help them take their mind set off negative thoughts means, you are helping someone but at the same time doing something productive. If someone is productive, it can also help improve your physical appearance. What I mean by this is, a person may feel terrible about their physical appearance and just by walking can create a difference. It does not have to be a huge task but, when you accomplish the task it feels wonderful how much may be done.

Lastly, as a person living in this country I know nothing is free and you work hard to reach goals. Everyone in this world has to work hard and put effort to get our tasks done. If we have to go to school, work, or pay bills we have to do something to get these stuff done because, no one else will do it for us. People who are inactive most likely don't get that far in life and all they are doing is running away from responsibilites and build up tasks that will never go away. I believe everyone should be active even if it's a tiny task.

Furthermore, a person will most likely accomplish something by being active even if the task is small. Life is all about diffcult task we run into but, we just have to defeat these tasks. We can take breaks when were not feeling well or stressed but, majority of the time we should try to be active. Life is all about doing something at all times and not just sit around doing nothing and expect everything to be done for you. We all face though times but that's just another problem we have to face. Everything about life is to be active so one day all that work pays of and you are able to accomplish your goals. Not everyone gets the same opportunities as others, some people can not walk, talk, or move small things like these should make us work hard and accomplish our goals. I believe if you active you are able to accomplish more then one goal and this makes you feel proud about yourself.",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,8.0,6.889553070068359,7
4130C1E55000,"The only to achieve our goals is by actually doing something. although some people may think that inactivity is part of life, that chances will show later in their lives. I think that by being active opportunities will show with more frequency in our lives. It will improve our skills, keep ourselves healthier just by being active, and it will open a we world full of new opportunities and success.

Being active will bring perseverance to our lives. One example is the improvement of our skills. Just by being active we will make a progress on our skill, or even develop new ones. This will take us to always have advantage over inactive people. It will also help us live out of something that we like. This is why I think that improving and developing skills is very important in human life.

Activeness is super important for all of us. Another example of the importance of being active is our health status. Being active when speaking on a fitness way is very important. This is so important that has one big impact of our health. being inactive can lead people to some diseases, some of they can be terminal such as cancer. This is another reason that takes me to believe that doing something is a big deal in our lives.

Putting ourselves to work on something will give us a life of success. The last example is the opportunities that an active life can bring to us. By having an active life, just like I mention before will improve and develop new skill. This skills will lead us to a life with several opportunities that will make our lives a lot easier to succeed. This is possibly the main reason of why we should always put ourselves to work on something.

To conclude with this information. I think that challenging, or putting ourselves to work on something may be hard, but the results of this are worth enough to motivate ourselves. Health, new opportunities, and self-improvement are so part of our lives. It is our choice to be an active or an inactive person the the result of each are clear.

E0E060143B79,"Do you think failure lead you to do better? In this paper i will argue about never losing enthusiasm by falling and falling. Failure should be just another way to do better, because you try until you get it right, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. Also, enthusiasm and try is the key to success.

First of all, when you try until you get it right, sometimes you get really frustrated. For example; in freshman year i remember that i couldn't actually get good grades in my algebra class, i remember that i try and try my harder to get good grades. I even stayed after school, I was doing my homework, i was watching videos from my teacher. However, i was still getting bad grades in my class but i keep trying and i finally become a success in the class.

Secondly, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. When you are working on a project or you are working on a personal goal sometimes thing doesn't actually goes the way you had planted. For example; if you are trying to solve a mathematics problem but you never get the solution you're supposed to get. Although, you keep trying and you always fail, you actually learning from it. However, by keep trying your best you actually getting experience from your failure and that helps you to success later in life.

Finally, enthusiasm and trying is the key to success. For example; when you want to achieve something but you fail, each time you're losing enthusiasm because you think that you can not do it, but if you keep trying and trying their will be a time that you will going to success and you would said that you try your best and never lost enthusiasm for your goal.

In conclusion, some people said that failure doesn't lead you to success, but they wrong because the more you fail, the more you try, and when you get it right, it will be a completely success for you. Going failure to failure led you to a good way to do better in life because the harder you try the better you do to success. In the future never stop trying without losing enthusiasm because enthusiasm is the key of your success.",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,8.0,7.004001140594482,7
492FF7D7E726,"Have you ever thought if we were always doing something that just maybe we would accomplish everything we need to do? Thomas jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something"". I strongly believe that if students would by always doing something will help them into getting more accomplishment or will get you somewhere. By students accomplishing more and more by always doing something ,in other terms students will have less responiblites, and having more free time.

For my first example, on why it is a great idea on always doing something to accomplish more so students, will have less responibilites. For one is that students will have less worring in there heads. Having that said if students had more worries then they usally then most likely they won't be paying attention during class. This also includes not having any stress. Why? Because students won't be stressing out on not doing them. If so, students would be stressing over about it on when they would accomplish them either before, after school, or during there weekend. But therefor, by having them done students won't be worried about getting them done because they would already have them accomplished. Lastly, on not having resopnibilites students will have some time on doing there school work. Student won't be worried on having their work turned in late or not turing it in at all. This comes to my next example on why it is really important to accomplish everything, so you would have more free time!

Another example, on why it is a great idea on always doing something to accomplish more, so students will have more free time. Who doesn't like free time? Honestly, by having free time in your hand can get more things accomplish. If you honestly don't have anthing else do do in your free time. Then maybe student could find something else to accomplish, like having extra work done for extra credit. Yet if you do have some free time and would love to have a good time then you should go off for an aventure. Like for instanties going out to the beach for the weekend with a group of friends. Have a realxing trip in a sunny day with your feet into the sand and seeing childeren running around the beach and could go out during the beatiful night . Also speading some quality time with famly is also really great having a cook out ,or just watching a movie. Lastly, going to a after school event or activity with other students for instances going to a volleyball game, soccer game. soccer game, or even a lacross game to support the team during your free time is also a great idea. Not having to be worried or stressed out on having anything done cause you would already have accomplished is perfect.

Overall, I believe when Thomas Jefferson wrote this great quote he knew exactly what he was saying because all of it is true. Many people may think it's something bad or negative to always be ahead of the game. Why? because everything students do comes with a good outcome or to just make the better out of students. Less responabilites and having more free time are just some of many good ideas of why it's alwasy good on doing something. Students will get somewhere in life with they truely believe in them selfs.

777B896CB2A7,"Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Me personally I think that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I will tell you reasons why I think this way. Plus have you ever thought that you achieved something in your life before?

My first reason is that you like doing something that you already achieved but you think it's boring and you want to change it up, to make it more challenging for you and you want to see if you can achieve it. Like me I play soccer and when I shoot the ball I have a curving technique and then one day I wanted to change it up I saw a video of people playing soccer and shooting the ball in a different style and I decided that I wanted to try it out. A few hours have passed I tried doing it myself the way they kicked the ball is that the ball was moving side to side so the goalkeeper would have less time to see the ball and also have a less chance to save it. So after a few practices I started getting the run up right, where to hit the ball, and a little bit of movement on the ball started to show. Finally, one day the ball was moving so fast in the air and I have done it. I felt proud of myself and I know have to shoot two ways.

My second reason is doing something you've tried but never finished it. You wanted to do something else and leave that behind. I was in soccer practice and my coach told us to do planks for a minute. I got so nervous that I knew that I couldn't hold it for a minute. When the time came I cheated, I didn't do it I always skipped planks every practice. Then one day I was thinking that I shouldn't keep skipping planks but I do the rest of the practice. I said to myself ""How am I suppose to get stronger when I am not doing the planks at practice."" So the next practice I had the courage to do the planks at first I wasn't very good at it, after a few practices I could do planks for a minute and I've done something good for myself.

My third reason is doing something that made you give up but then you came back stronger than ever. My soccer coach made my whole team and I run 16 laps around the track. All of us complained because that is too much for us, then our coach said ""if you guys do good on these laps then I will reduce the laps next practice."" All of us still said that it was too much, so we gave it a shot, all of us got 10 laps done but we were all tired we all said to each other that we should give up this is a lot of laps then we all agreed. The coach was furious with us that we didn't finish our laps he made us do push ups, sit ups, lunges, and more exercises he knew that we didn't like. The day after that we have a group chat of my whole team we were talking about having our own private practice without our coach and that we should work out on our endurance to become faster and complete the 16 laps that we still have to do and make our coach proud of us we all agreed having a private practice. That same day and a few hours later have passed we got to work, a few hours have passed and then finally we all did it all of us were proud of each other. The next day we had practice our coach made us do the 16 laps again because we didn't finish it the last practice. So we did our 16 laps under 45 minutes our coach was amazed that we all did our 16 laps without stopping, he was proud of us and told us that he would be nicer to us the next practice because he knew we worked hard doing these laps, our coach was proud of us.

My last reason is doing something that you've never done before. This time it won't be about soccer I wanted to change my style I wanted to be more confident about myself, I wanted to look good everywhere I go, I wanted to be out of my comfort zone. I decided I wanted to change my appearance, I went clothes shopping at the mall to buy clothes that will look good on me. I went to many different stores, I bought many shirts, flannels, sweaters, button up shirts, jeans, sneakers, boots, and jewelry like necklaces and bracelets. I was done with my shopping so I went home, I wrote in my notebooks on how many outfits I can make with the shopping I did. I made many outfits and I couldn't wait to try them out, I made casual outfits, dressy casual outfits, and also dressy outfits. Tomorrow I had school it was the perfect chance to try out one of my outfits. I put my first outfit on I felt out of my comfort zone but still fell good throughout the school day I got many compliments and head turnings I was amazed on how I changed my appearance. I tried the rest of my outfits on different days and occasions.

All in all everybody should have at least accomplished something throughout their life, it feels good doing something that you've accomplished it doesn't matter if you only have accomplished something once or many it still feels nice doing that. Just like me doing all this stuff makes me feel good about myself and I hope you all feel the same about yourself.  ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,8.0,7.671559810638428,8
49E375E8CA7B,"Studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start an after school homework club. Do you think its a good idea to start an after school homework club? I think its a great idea let me tell you why its a good idea.

First you can get help with your work. the teacher can help you if you dont understand your work. If your having trouble with your work the teachers or students can help you and they will show you how to do it. The teachers will explain how your making mistakes. some students may not have a good home and the may not be able to complete there assignments because of the fact that they dont have supplies to complete there work so the teachers and students can help the student who needs help.

Second many students get low grades due to incomplete homework. In the club the students complete homework then turn it in the next day. students will turn homework in on time everyday. Students can work on classwork, projects, and homework. students can complet homework early so they will not do it on the last day.

Finaly other students can volunteer to help students. Students can get rewards for helping others. students can particpate for class grades. Both students learn from working together. They learn there mistakes and correct each others papers.

In concluson i think starting an after school homework club is a good idea heres why. You can get help with your work and many students will not have low grades due to incomplete homework. Other students can help students who need help with there work. as you can see thats why i think its a good idea to start a homework club.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,7.0,6.716362476348877,7
0484BCFC725D,"Do you think fail is good? in this paper i will argue failure and success in life. Some people get sad when they fail something, they try to not loss the enthusiasm, sometimes people get mad by them self.

First, people get sad when they fail something, because they try the best so they can get everything right as they doe, and maybe they never image that they gonna fail, and sometimes some persons cry because they fail.

Second, some people try to not loss the enthusiasm when they fail at the first time, because maybe they have a good positive and they said that the next time they do not going to fail, so its mean that they not loss the enthusiasm at the first time they fail.

Last one, person get mad by his or her self, cause they think they don't do well, and they get really mad when they fail for a little error they have, but that get that they are learning because the errors that person have made them learn.

Some people said that failure is a bad idea for success. but some people don't loss the enthusiasm as they been falling and that made the person won for those who said that failure is a bad a idea because the person that don't loss the enthusiasm is keep going until they make sure to not fail anymore, and as they been falling they been learning.

In conclusion, for some people failure is a bad idea.

B7AABB24BDB8,"Yes,we accomplish more if we are always doing something rather that doing inactivity. If we keep on doing something to accomplish it then victory is always near to us. Our continious work to accomplish any task will be paid later by our better results. Hard work and dedication always lead us towards the success so does if we are always doing something to accomplish the task. Doesn't it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. It somehow can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng.

There is a famous saying that ""Rome was not built in a day"". Here the people were always working for many years to built Rome into a beautiful city. We can see their hard work and dedication really worth it as it is one of the most beautiful city among the world. Would it have been possible if they were doing inactivity? Obvioulsy no nah? Doesn't it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. It somehow can can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng. As ""Where there is will there is the way"" in the same way if we really want something then we can achieve it if we keep on working and always do something for that. I can support it by saying that failure will never ever take you if your determination towards success is strong enough and keep workng for it.

Let's take an example of two students. if two students are assigned a long project in the summer vacation and one student started working from the mean day so that it will be easier from him to complete before the due date whereas the other one kept on realxing thinking that he will start working on it at the last of vacation. Now all of us what the result gonna come. One student happily submitted the project accomplishing it before the due date and the other one had to suffer a lot. So which one would you prefer accomplishing by always doing something in the right time or rushing to complete task in due time.

So,in my opinion always doing something to accompish more is better idea than thinking that inactivity also serve a purpose. No one want to rush to complete any task at the due time so we should be always doing somehing to accomplish more. Slow and steady always wins the race but it doen't mean to say that doing work slowly will worth it everytime. I mean that you should be always doing something in oder to accomplish in time. We can learn lesson from tortoise and rabbit story. From tortoise side,like topic says we should be always doing something to accomplish more or in time in the same way tortoise kept on walking for the race although he can't run having faith in himself that he can do it. From rabbit side we shouldn't do mistake to think our competetors not strong enough than you. We should always respect your competetors thinking that they are as stronger as you and keep doing our assesments to be the most deserving one of that victory. We should have strong believe in ourselves that I can do it then nothing seems impossible.

In conclusion,last but the least I would like to end up saying that if we are always doing something then we can accomplish more compare to the one who works inactively. Time is the most important key factor in our life. Once it is gone it is gone for forever..So,the key point is we should understand the importance of time and utilize it properly and make it effective by always doing something which leads us to the accomplishment of our task.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,8.0,6.235402584075928,6

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because he will know which advice to choose. Also he will have better opinions of advice, then bad ones. If he chooses older person and not younger person, it's because older people have more experience.

First, reason is he will know which advice to choose. He will go with his gut feeling and make the right choice. For example, if he asks advice from his best friend and his friend he would go with his best friend's advice because that is his gut feeling. He also knows if it's smart, or not. He knows he has to listen to his heart not his head.

Second, reason is he will have better opinions of advice, than bad ones. If he chooses older person and not younger person, it's because older people have more experience.

5AC1AB0965F6,"Ever since I was little I would dreamed of going to Hawaii. I would always think of seeing the beautiful crystal clear blue seas. I would want to go scuba diving and get a view of the animals in the ocean.

reasons why I would want to go to Hawaii because it has a huge water park. I always have fun at water parks because it has big slides and big pools and other fun stuff. But Hawaii water park is like three times the size of the water parks I've been in. During the summer I like to go to my pool and spend my time there. I always wished I had a slide in my pool. But my pool is still fun. I invite my friends to make the pool more fun. We play sharks and Minos and other games.

Another reason why I would go to Hawaii is because I want to try out their sea food. I heard their sea food is really good and it come fresh out the ocean. Personally my favorite sea food is crab. But i like crab better when its a crab soup.

One more important reason why I would want to go to Hawaii is because I want to spend time with my family. I rarely get to spend anytime with my family. The reason that is because I have to go to school and my work and stuff. Then my when i comeback home my dad has to go to work. He comes back around midnight. So basically I never get to see him. I probably see him like for 10 minutes but then I cant. At least I get to see him during holidays.

The first thing I would want to do when I get to Hawaii is go to the huge water park. I want to go there to have fun. I also want to ride all the slides in the park. I want to play around with my family and have fun with them. Me and my dad always go on big slides when we're in a water park.

Another activity I would want to do when I get there is ride a bike around the city i'm gonna be staying at. I want to get to know the city and all of its locations. I also would love to ride on the mountains so i can get a nice view and take some photos.

Something else I would do is swim in the crystal clear oceans with my family. I have never seen my feet when i'm in the ocean and i want to experience that. I also want to have fun throwing a ball around with my family.

The first things I would want to see in Hawaii is go scuba diving and get to see the beautiful sea creatures swim around the ocean. Also for reason I want to get to touch them, and I want to see my families reaction. I always wanted to sea wild sea creatures. I never get to sea them because the closest ocean to me is dirty so you cant see nothing under the water. I want to see them swimming around and see other animals in the water. Every time I see a sea creature. The only way I would see one is if I caught it with a fishing rod or its dead on the sand or In the aquarium.

I would really want to go on a helicopter and see all of Hawaii. I just want to explore and get a beautiful view of Hawaii. At least see two dolphins hop from the ocean. That would be a perfect moment. But I just want to see Hawaii. I would probably go see one of does fire performance too.

One more thing I would want to go see in Hawaii is my family having fun. I want to see them having fun because I rarely get to see them having fun. We usually don't have fun because were not always together. One of my family membesr has to work and the other has to do something else. I really wished we could spend time longer together.

I would go to Hawaii because I get to increase the relationship with my family and have fun. If I got to Hawaii i'm not be stressed out during that time.",4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,8.0,7.817043304443359,8
E18675E47293,"Dear,

School Board of Education

I personally disagree with the idea of adding one and a half hours of school. This is a terrible Idea and here are some reasons why I disagree so please grab a seat, relax, and take your time to read this. The first reason why there shouldn't be extra school hours is students will have to walk in the dark. The second reason is students will have less time for sports and other after school activities and also less time for family and friends. And finally students will be sick of having school for a such a long period of time and possibly stop going to school.

First of all not everyone is fortunate enough to have a ride to school but that doesen't mean that they can't go to school so they walk, but if the school board adds more school time students who walk will have to walk in the dark. Walking in the dark could be very dangerous because you don't know whats in front nor what's behind you and that could cause students not to go to school anymore because they will be scared of walking in the dark and feel unsafe. Another example of why it could be dangerous to walk in the dark is if someone is trying to cross the street and a car doesen't see them they'll probably get ran over and the school won't be responsible for the accident. Something that also is good to keep in mind is that if the school hours get changed and even if you try to avoid students from walking in the dark There's a cost. You'll have to put street lights and that could be very expensive, and the money could be used for educational purposes.

The second reason why extra school hours shouldn't be added is students won't have much time for sports or other after school activities. Sports and school are both important and they both should be equally balanced. So if school gets longer than maybe we'll have less time to see our family and friends. I remember when I did football practice was getting shorter and shorter because winter came, and during that time it was also raining a lot and snowing a lot so we missed a lot of games and practices, imagine if school was an hour and a half long, there wouldn't even be a football season at all.

The last reason why an extra hour and a half of school is a bad idea is because, a lot of students would get really sick of school and stay home or try to get suspended so that they don't have to got to school. We've all been in that situation where we don't want to go to school so we pretend we're sick, even I get tired of having to go to school every day, in fact I don't really want to be here right now but I have to. We've all tried to make our parents believe that we're sick, but that's a really old trick and parents already know it, and make us go to school. If students get more school time they just won't stand it and they'll start skipping school. But don't worry I won't do that.

In conclusion I think adding an extra hour and a half of school is a horrific idea, it will just cause more problems for the education system, students, parents, and even for our hard working teachers because they will have a more work and less time for themselves. But I also understand why you would want to add an extra hour of school.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,8.0,8.112214088439941,8

413E0A5AE69C,"What is something I want to do ? There are lots of things i want to do,and one of them is to learn how to play soccer. Is really fun to play but not so much when I lose because there are other people that know how to play really well. Knowing how to play makes it more fun then when you dont know ,and also if you are playing in teams its not fun if your team lost because you dont know how to play. Soccer is a sport, Im not really good at sports but soccer seems easy and fun,but is just not the same when you don't know how to play. It sounds and looks really easy to just follow and kick the ball,but you also need to know how to control the ball and not let others take it from you and you need to know how to score , if you dont know how to do that then dont try to play on a team it can be really embarrassing sometimes. However when youre playing with your friends you get to have a good time even if you have no idea how to play. All in trying to say with this is that learning how to play soccer is worth your time and effort. Soccer is not just for professional players is also for people like me that are trying to learn how to be good at it. If Think of a known soccer player,that person youre thinking of is good at what he or she does (soccer) that is why youre thinking of him/her in the future i want people to think of me as an excellent player,maybe not professional but a good soccer player is enough. people all over the world plays soccer not just kids or teens but even adults play it, because it is a fun and healthy game. Most of the time you will see man playing it but it dosn't mean that women cant play,in fact i know plenty of women that know how to play soccer really well and not only there good at it but they know what there doing, I hope that one day i will be as good as i wish i was. Its not easy to learn something new mostly if its a sport but if you put your mind on learning how to play soccer you can learn and be the best player you can be, but if you dont put your mind into it the that means youre no trying hard enough and that way youre never going to be as good as you may want, and believe when i say once you know how to play youre gonna be nonstop able and youre gonna become really good at playing soccer, yo can even become one of the best soccer player there is but you wont know that unless you try. When it comes to soccer the are a lot of people that knows really knows how to play really well and there also a lot of people that dont have any idea of how to play soccer but i am sure that if they play together no matter how bad at playing some of them are i am sure that they would have a lot of fun. The main idea of playing soccer is to have a good time with your friends or family but some people take it really serious,soccer is even a career and if the ones that have that as a career are not good at it then their career is over because no one will want that person on their team ,so they have to be good at playing soccer in order to succeed as a soccer player. Unlike a normal career this one is actually fun, I would love to have this career but im not really good at playing soccer so i cant but if you or someone you know have this type of skills then you have to play or you have ho encourage this person to play. And what skills im i talking about ? well if youre good at kicking things (whos not ?) or running really fast and other skills that are essentials to play this game,those are some well two skills that you need to play soccer. Playing soccer is not just fun but it keeps you moving so that makes you exercise and also it keeps your body warm so if you want to play but dont want to play because you are cold just remember that at the beginning you will be cold but in a couple of minutes you will be warm and it wont be a problem anymore. And dont forget to bring water or and energy drink for when youre playing youre gonna need it because you will be running and moving a lot so youre gonna need something to drink,and you dont want to be too tired and make your team lose you do not want to be that person. Team work is important most when youre playing soccer, one person cant win a game but the entire group together can because they pass the ball to each other when the one that has the ball dont know or dont have what to do next they can easily pass it to the other person thats on their team and that other person can score or they can pass it to some other person on their group and that person can score or it can just go like that until one person gets the ball and score unless the other team takes the ball from that team and score first the other team wouldnt make it but this other team would make it, and they would win,Im just trying to explain here how can a game go most of the games are like that well most of the games i have play go like that. In other country like the Salvador kids playing soccer outside their houses is very common in there they call it football but they write it futball its almost the same you just take one o out in there kids learn to play since they can remember because its a really known game, if you dont know how to play it is a shame because other kids maybe your friend will be playing while you can only see them play just because you dont know how to play that is why it is really important to learn how to play soccer. Just think how exited and fun can be to play an sport or game that you like its gonna be just like that if you play soccer because once you learn how to play it you are gonna like it and you will want to play every day.

All you need to play soccer is to know the rules of the game and want to play it and a ball that is all you need to play soccer that is the only equipment you would need a team is important too you cant play by yourself or you can play against someone else too so only is needed two people to play soccer but is better in a team of at least five people per team is needed two teams to play and in each team. I want to learn soccer. ",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,8.0,6.383661270141602,6

EE6ECB910EB2,"In my opinion, the idea to take off one day of school can have some benefits and some disadvantages, so is bad because in my opinion is a totaly change of schedules and students who work after school can have problems with that, other thing is, for me is not a big chage if they want to save some resources and enegy, but also can be good because the students and teachers rest more and they can save a bit of energy.

The students who have a job can have problems with their bosses and it can make a more hard schedule for the student because they don't gonna have any time to rest and they can have troubles at school if they don't rest the necesari for their health and their consentration at school; other negative thing is because it's unnecessary because it's not a big chage, if the school want to save energy one day don't gonna make a big change and also, maybe it's okay as it's and I think the original schedule with five days of school is good for all and it don't make any problem, and the last negative thing I see is the hours of work of the teachers, the teachers maybe don't do enough hours of work and don't get the same payment and maybe can affect them in that way.

These idea also have positive things like the chance for students and teachers to rest more or just for students, they have more time to do homework or work, other positive thing is to save a bit of energy and some resources, in some way the school can get benefit of these.

The problem with the schedules and the save of energy and resources, are some of the benefits and disadvantages I thought for these theme and in my opinion it's not a good idea to change something what is already working with something who maybe not work very well and something who is don't give big changes.",3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,6.0,5.342544078826904,5
CA11FD3CAC43,"Many people have been told about the fact that the students should know the career they want in high school and learn about it. Therefore, many societies around the world, are expect to provide help to the students to find the career they want to study by the time they enter high school. In fact, many schools select the courses for the students based on the career the students choose. In addition, many schools think that the students should be young when they think about the career they want, just to make sure that they will not change their minds in the future. So, it is a good idea to commit to a career at a young age.

Based on that, students will have time to prepare themselves to be ready for the career they choose. Students will be able to make sure that the career they choose is good for them. If students are prepare at a young age for the career they want, then they will be able to enjoy it. For example, I want to study interior design, therefore, I have to take art classes to learn about colors and how to combine them. If students choose their career at a young age, they will be more prepare and have better results while complete their life goals, because life goals are very importat to have a good life's quality.

Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose. It should be a good idea for students to know themselves and what they like, because it is unpleasant when a person have to study what the parents want him or her to study just because they could not have done what they wanted to do. So if the schools support students to find the perfect career for them, then this disagreeable situation will stop. In many cases, people that had to choose a wrong career have to deal with a unhappy life, because they do not feel well in their jobs. Once again, if students have the school's support, they will be able to find the perfect career for them.

In addition, students will learn about the career and how it works. It might not be noticeable for people the fact that nothing is how it seems, some careers might seem to be easy and be hard, or the opposit, the career might seem to be hard and be really easy. For example, it is easy to judge a lawyer when he do not win a case, but we have no idea how hard the work he did can be. In my 19 years in this world, I learned that nothing is as easy as we want it to be, but if we search information about what we want to do for life, we will be happier, that is a fact. Schools should require an essay in which students can write about what they like and what skills they have.

So, students should know what they want and what they are good in. If students learn about the career they want they will have the opportunity to be great professionals. If the students start learning about the career they want at a young age, then they will have plenty of time to prepare themselves mental and phisically for their future career. Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose so they do not regret it in the future. And last but not least, students will have time to learn how the careers work, so they will have many ideas of how to complete them. In conclusion, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age by the time they enter high school.",4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,8.0,7.587752342224121,8
B392D119C41A,"The one place I would like to visit is South Korea. What place would you like to go to during your break time?

The frist thing I would do frist is visit my aunt's house because I want to know what it looks like in real life not the ones in the photo or on internet. The place where my aunt's and uncle lives is very beautiful and very nice looking house. i want to move in one of those houses that my aunt's and uncle lives.

The second thing that I would do next is go to Generic_City a city but I actually want to visit all of them. The first I would go to is Generic_City because it's one of the largest city in korea. that's the second thing that I would do when I'm in korea. Some cities are very lively here, but in korea these cities are very lively and very loud. But at night time the cities look very beautiful, full of light and life.

The third thing I would do next is go to cafes and shoppes. The only reason that I choosed cafes and shoppes is because they a Dog Cafe. This Dog cafe is full of dogs and it's a place where they also serve food and take care of your dogs. For shoppes they litterally have the same stuff in the U.S. but in their own style.

The fourth thing I want to do when I arrive to South Korea is propably go to a modelling station. Korean people that are model is very stylish with there outfit choise like BTS a boy group people fangirl over them people because of their outfit choise and makeup by makeup artist.

Last but the least thing that I want to do is going concert that the fangirling people that goes like ""wow look how deep their voice is?"" or ""Wow how do they reach those high notes?"". I am not going to those places. I would like to go to old Home from the 1900's becuse they look cool becuse I see alot of people that dresses up for the moives of histroy times like how they excute people, sword fights, and more.

This is what I would like to do when I go to South Korea and do those things that I want to do when I go there.

Have you thought about where you want to go with your family or friends? Well, if you have do the thing that you want to when you go there and if you don't well, that was a waste of time. That's all I have to say. Hope you have a nice trip.

5BE99F2E4030,"Have you ever been thinking about doing something fun and active outdoors with your friends and family? Well, I'm going to share with you some ideas of having a great time outside. I like to invite my friends over and play with my dog outside. Or if you and your family are going on a trip or vacation, you might go to the beach. But what is it that makes these activities fun? Sometimes you may not feel like going outside and just want to stay inside and play video games, which is fine sometimes but you can't just play video games all the time. You should go outside and be active more often.

Like I said, if you have a dog you should always play with them because it's fun for both of you! Dogs tend to make everyone feel happier inside and they help reduce stress. Another great outdoor activity would include playing sports. Playing sports is one of the most fun activities you can do outside with other people. Sports like basketball, soccer, football, baseball, volleyball are all great fun activities for outside! One amazing enjoyable activity would include going a near by park because theres so much to do there! You can do a variety of fun activities such as playing with your dog, playing a sport, you can go on the swings, you can go on the slide, run, jump, you can have so much fun at parks!

Sometimes when I get stressed or upset, I like to go outside with my dog and just observe the great outdoors. It makes me feel a little bit better and my dog helps me reduce my stress. I love my dog so much and so do a lot of other people. They are really fun to play with and spend time with. Going on walks is fun for me and my dog. Walking your dog in the neighborhood is a great way to get out and be active.

Doing outdoor activities is great for everyone because you can have fun with all your friends and family and feel strong and energetic. Even if you don't like the activity, you should give it a try. Or, if you're feeling down, maybe an outdoor activity will make you fell better.

I talked to you about the benefits and the different ways you can have an enjoyable time outside. I recommend that you try doing one of these activities and spend time with your friends and family. Maybe going outside will be your new favorite thing!                ",4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.5,9.0,8.427924156188965,8
7D4E376FFB20,"On a sunny Monday as I was walking to unknown, my hands were shaking and my heart was pounding twice as fast. Although it was a hot sunny day I was shivering. As I get close to the place I was heading my stress goes higher and higher. Finally, I reached my destination. School. My counselor showed me all my classes and I was trying to remember the class number and the way to get there. It was lunch break and everyone was going to the cafeteria. I was lost. I went to ask one of my classmates to show me the way,I asked her and she didn't answer she started using her phone. I didn't like what she did. I thought she is a mean girl and I went to find it myself. The other day she came to me and showed me her phone. I read what was written there. She said that she can't speak English also that last day she used her phone to translate for me but I left before she could even tell me.

First impressions are more likely to change after you get to know the person. If you meet someone the first time and you didn't like that person for some reason, as you get to really know her/him and talk to the person your perspective will change toward that individual. Sometimes the person will proof you right and they are as you thought. But I personally, believe that first impressions will change after you get to know someone.

Unfortunately, we live in a society that we are always judged by our race, religion,gender and or physical appearance. We are not suppose to judge people by their physical reactions or by their appearance. I remember my first day of school in America three years ago. I was the only Hijabi in my class and everyone was staring at me. Some would come to me and ask me random questions and some would just give me a weird look and pass by.

There are people who have no self-confident and it's hard for them communicate with people around them. Being anti-social is one of the reasons for not making a good first impression. Some people don't make a first good impression because of the lack of confidence. They are shy, and don't know how to start a conversation or to project their voice while talking to someone for the first time.

All human being have the habit of making pictures of the person they meet for the first time in their mind before knowing a single thing about the person. The first picture could be a good or a bad one. Overall the picture will be based on the person's physical traits. Judging people is never a nice thing to do. As someone said "" Don't judge a book by its cover"". People should not judge people or make a bad impression about someone they know nothing about. Everyone is different and have their own kind of difficulties.             ",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,6.0,7.866220951080322,8
B6B85CE5C8F5,"When it comes to trying to be someone, is it better to improvise or follow the script all the time?

Everyone needs to have their own individuality and be original instead of trying to be something else because that way you learn more about yourself. Also, you are acknowledging different methods about how to be better than yourself. And one of the most important things, you could make a good influence in someone else's life and teach him/her how to find their path in their own way. No matter what happens, you always have to follow yourself.

When you learn more about yourself it means that you do not just learn things that you already know about yourself, you also learn new things that you did not know about yourself. For example, one day you are going to the basement of your house which is really big and put some good music. While you are listening to your favorite songs from your playlist, you are dancing according to the tempo and doing the dancing moves that you usually do. After dancing for a long while, suddenly you let the music take control over you and you make a back flip without practicing it before. You are very surprised because you did something that you did not know you could do and after that, you keep practicing that move and perfectioning it and it comes out natural. That is how you learn more about yourself.

You are acknowledging different methods to be better than yourself. This means you will do whatever is right in order to become a better person. For example, Robert Downey Jr used to have a terrible life by consuming drugs and other things that got him in trouble with the law. He even went to court for all the messy things he did. After a long time taking bad decisions, he finally decided to make things better for the people who cares about him and specially for him. It took him over 5 years for him to get back on his feet; with his own effort and the support from his family and friends, he started to make a good difference for the world. Right now, Robert is one the best actors in Hollywood, he has an excellent life with his wife and kids on his side, and is a great influence for millions of people. That is how you acknowledge different methods to be better that yourself.

Some people say that you are copying someone else when you try to be yourself. However, they are wrong because you actually are listening to those tips that you have heard and following them under your own perspective. That way you are definitely writing your own script but at the same time, giving the deserved credit to the person who gave you those tips. For instance, when you are trying to get a girl that you met in a party but you have no idea of what to do in order to get her attention. You ask your friend for some advice to accomplish your goal so you do not go through a bad experience. He tells you what to do exactly and shows you with some women at the party and now you have some ideas of what you can do. So before you reach out to that girl, your friend tells you ""be yourself all the time"" and you get the courage to talk to her. After following those examples in your own way, the girl started to have deep feelings for you and everything worked out a lot well and make some influence to some of your friends who need that kind of help. That is how you follow your own script with your own terms.

In conclusion, it is very important that you have be yourself all the time because it shows that you do not need somebody in order to be somebody. You learn about yourself so you can get to know your own person more than you can know about an anime character. You acknowledge new ways to become better than yourself like if you were in a videogame, you are going to the next level slowly. You make a good influence by doing things as right as possible and you give people some benefits out of it. To be yourself you have to do what your gut tells you to do if you think it is going to give some benefits in some way.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,7.0,8.508138656616211,9
BFEA2E7F1486,"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment because at the day of today there's a lot people that doesn't want to accept the way that you are or you want to be. They will never be satisfied, they will judge you, they will talk bad things about you, but at the end it's just a obstacle that the life put in your way, so you can surpass it and finally find yourself and be how you are.

To be yourself in this actual world it's difficult for some people because sometimes they don't support the judges from other people and most of this people just decide to end with their life. For example the LGBT community get a lot of hate, judge and bad things from other people that is not part of it. People in this world just talk about others without thinking the pain that they can cause by saying just a few simple words. Other example is the people from other country that travel to another, there are people that are racist and make people feel that they are from another world, when they are actually they same, the only thing that change is the culture and language.

To be yourself in a world that is contantly trying to make you something else is one of the most important things that people have to achieve, to live the life better because you will never progress in your emotional life if you don't make people accept the way that you are.

For teenagers to be theirselves is most difficult because they are in a young age and sometimes they don't really know how they are or how they want to be, and when they finally find it, the hard part is coming. Then for older people, most of them don't care what people say about them, I have seen a lot of older people that dress and make to their selves what they want and I really like to see them because it makes me to be less insecure about myself, they just make me think a lot.

Live the life by showing how you are, the opinion of other people doesn't have to make you more insecure or make you think that if you do this or other things you will get judged or hated. You have to fight to achieve this because life is better if you do it, is better if you don't care about others comments, you will be more stronger than before if you fight with all this situations.

You will be more happy and will have a great life if you are yourself, you will be more certain about your opinions, decisions and actions. You can help other people to achieve this goal that is ""To be yourself"" because sometimes there is people that need from others to make a change in their life.

If you help them and they accept your help, they will be thankful to you because you help them a lot and you was with them, when nobody wasn't.

At the end of your days you will be really thankful to you because you live life the way that you are, not the way that others wanted you to be. You will think in all the things that you have to supported and achieved just to get your goal, to be who you are and at end you will knew that it wasn't hard. It was just obstacles that maked your life more stressful and harder but you did it. You got all the things that you wanted and the most important was, to be yourself.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,8.0,7.531719207763672,8

Maybe its their same teacher who teaches the same class it will be great for students. Teachers will know the weakness of student of what they need help more with during class. This is why during school homework club would be great for teacher or students. Students who work after school could come to this club too they would be able to get their homework done and still be able to work at their job.

Some homework club cost money which might be hard to pay for some families. If my school would have homework club it should be free.

If there are any bad educators who does not know anything about subject that would messed up the teacher and student both of their time. That would messed up students education who spend their time coming to thomework club. Speaking of that school should have great volunteers who can help their student with any subject.

Many students in the high school are already mature enough to be on their own. Also, getting into college a year earlier it is a good advance on the career of the student and built a financial life easier. A student who choose to take courses in the summer or in the evenings is investing on his future and showing interest of being always better.

First of all, many students in high school are mature enough to be on their own. For example, juniors in high school are already driving, most of the times working, and giving their best at school. Being able to control and take responsibilities like that just increase their chance of succeed in life. It is almost an adult life, that shows that some high school student who choose to graduate a year earlier are ready for the adult world.

Secondly, getting into college a year later helps the student in many different ways. As an example, students who get into college a year earlier has an advance of time to built their career in the way they want to. Also, a year it's a long time for students, that means that being able to graduate a year earlier and get a job right away, they have a diploma and their ready to work. Being able to get a job younger means that their going to built their financial life easier.

Thirdly, if a student is showing interest on taking courses in the summer or in the evenings, that just shows that they are taking responsibilities and are more than ready for the adult world. If a student take that kind of responsibility and is focused on his life, shows an level of maturity that is essential to succeed in life.

In conclusion, being able to get into college a year earlier, show responsability, and prove to everyone their level of maturity is a good punch line into life. Therefore, programns that allow high school students to graduate in three years is not just a good idea but a great chance to trust the young, because they're taking control of the world in the future.

CC971FB7A9FF,"Everything have competition whatever people or products, it is always keep the better and kick out the worse. Most of people lost their job because they havn't a creative method, developing thinking and good education. Also, some of them lost their job because people dislike them. These people may have high education level, but more important things are they didn't learning how to be a good person when they are young. Students in high school are too young to think about their careers, because high school life is a time for students to developing their ability, there are infinite things they have to learn which important than career, and students should know what are parents' hope.

Students in a high school should develop their own ability that include physically, thinking and others. If a student interest sport, he may simulate a athlete to exercise; it doesn't mean he have to work hard and became a athlete. Everyone have their own interesting article, it's not a standard to think about what job he will have in the future. Also, a art students need to exercise, and a sport students need to learn some singing. It's not for the careers in the future, it's only for them have a healthier life.

Students in a high school need to learning other things which are much important than the career. Students have to learn about how to community to others. Besides, students should learning how to became a friendly person that make anyone feel nicely. For example, a person who has enough money that can spend a whole life, but there are not anyone wants to talk with him. It does matter how huge is his house or how many house he has, his life will be boring and solitary. Students learn how to live and be a nice person are more important than learn how to find a job.

Students should not consider how to find a job in their high school life. Parents provide money and food to their children to learn, because they hope their children have good education and a wonderful life. Parents never hope their children became a machine that do anything for the money.

For example, most parents will never order their children to earn money and give back to them. They will tell their children be happy and learning whatever their want at school. Students in high school are too young to consider about earn money and repay to their parents.

Students in high school are too young to think about what job they will take in the future. They should learn and know what can they do and what can't, and they should consider about how to become a good-nature person that can live in this society, and they should understand what their family and teacher really hope him to do.

F1620489BEB3,"I agree that changing the school lunch menu to a healthier option would be a better solution. This could help resolve some problem we have today. The top problem in the world for this topic is that many people in America are obese and numbers are growing. This also helps show a new generation the many healthier option to choose from. What i think the best thing is the amazing new foods and cultures it can be introduce to you. How many people do you know that their or your kids don't eat the school lunch cause of the food almost everyday?

In America we have gone through many tough time's but a big issue that started happening in the late 90's and early 2000's was the growth in obesed. The line for what was good and bad for you was smudged and the only thing that was okay was that it tasted good. That's why schools started noticing a change in peoples decisions for healthy or unhealthy choices. And change if not only a small bit to try and help, but that didn't mean they couldn't bring in their own food. Having a more healthier option would be good for students bodies and a better state of mind cause you know your giving your body energy and what it needs.

We go through life living the way we were raise. That also comes with the food that was given to us as teenagers and kids. All of us have at least one trait that your care giver did that now you inherited, some people drink coffee more then other cause that how they saw life as. Which is why showing kids and teenagers a better more healthier life style early show them better eating options and that all starts with what to eat for lunch at school cause your there for almost half the day.

The best part about eating a healthier life style is that you can try new and better options instead of the same lazy food. Almost every country use natural fresh produce in everything they eat cause of their culture. And showing people that might not like that idea, a food they wouldn't eat but end up loving it is the best feeling. This is also educational cause it introduces students to new culture are the world. This show's how they eat and prepare food in their country and the difference in our own lives. It's really eye opening for some people and it show kids not everything that doesn't look good is bad food.

Having a healthier option for school lunch is good but it take a lot of meal prep and it's more expensive them getting can or frozen goods. Employees that work in the lunch room are gonna have to come in more early to wash and cut fresh fruits and vegetables which means the school is gonna have to pay them more money cause their doing more. And to get the best quality produce, schools are gonna have to pay more money which some schools can't do. But the only thing that should matter is the students not this or that. The problem with schools is that their lowering down their standards with food to get things that aren't necessary. They could be using that money for better food and better silver wear items then what we have now.

Having school lunches be healthier is better for everyone even if it needs time to get use to. A better lunch can show people different and more unique foods around the globe also helps show's that not everyone's different. This also help's show people that there are better options in fresh and natural items rather then foods that have yellow dye-7. This would also help America be the country it wants to be and how Americans want other countries to see us as a stronger, mature, and all around amazing country. And show that this school is ready for change no matter what happens.",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,8.0,6.862118721008301,7

94ACF6006DB9,"My first opinion,

would be that to be a good person,

is you have to be your self no matter what is going to happen . For example a good behavior star at home because your parents have the responsibility to educate. Also some people said the students are very bad for other students, like they are bad influence .

My second, reason would be the your own problems can affect, your career. For example your grades at school if you are a good person with other people to be a good citizen just be you because people the just talk never do something good. But sometime teen don't deserve what they have for example school, job, people the they love them.

After that well, if you work that is a good idea because you can focus, and two things but if you are weak that will be a terrible decision . So a good behavior is excellent, because you always can find friends, and maybe a girlfriend but den pent of you.

In conclusion, if you are a good behavior you will be a good person, and the future, and a good guide for you children. Also if you are a good students,you will be have credit for college but you have to be a good behavior. So the mean, that you responsibility is work very hard to complete your goals.

The next text is about ""The firts impresions can change with the pass of time"". The object is give information to the reader about different things that make that the first impresions change, and how can affect. The text is made with examples and support ideas, that help to understand more the theme. Then tell that the impressions can change anytime.

The first impresions is when you current know at someone or something. It is the first opinion that you mind create, but this impresions or idea can change when you start to know better. When we current know a person, our mind create a idea that can be false or true, but is something that only can know with the time.

The change can affect or can benefit, that means that sometimes we thinks that is good and bad, thinks that is bad and is good. A example of affect is when we buy a car, and these is look like beautiful for autside, but when a mechanical check inside descover that have many damage. A example of benefit is when somebody told you something bad of other person, and when you talk with that person you descover that is false.

The first impresions can change for many reasons that our mind create; for example, false opinion, dissapointment, angry, or autocorrection. All these can have influence when you change your impresions of someone or something. For example, when we are angry all is look like bad or annoying. Other example, when we make a autocorrection of something that we believed that was bad or incorrect.

In my conclusion the firt impresions it's very important, no always going to be good or bad, your opinion going to change. I think when you don't know at someone or something is better wait a litte before make a bad or good idea about it.

ADCF328F2A47,"Security or Freedom

Sometimes to reach something, you have give something else. Security is big trouble that is discuted in all parts of the world, where people live their life with fear, without hope to reach a great future for their next generation. A lot of times, this troubles happen in places where people live under the control of the gangs or another dangerous group. I believe that adopt a curfew to try to protect the life of people on general is a great idea, due the big meaning that this represent in the life.

One of the reasons why this is a great idea is because means more security for people. If the city council adopt this curfew, people could not go around places too late because if they do it, they would be breaking the law. For example: If you are walking alone to home in the night at 9 P.M. you feel scared, now imagine that there is a man on the corner; you do not know if he is a criminal or a normal person, but you are scared , you feel insecure due the presence of that man in that place. Then this adoption look for that reason and prevent a tragedy.

Also, this adoption says that if the curfey is adopted, teenagers on the streets after 10 P.M. on weekdays and midnight on weekends, they would be braking the law. This is another big reason for this adoption, because this means less troubles for teenagers. As we know, a lot of teenagers are influenced by groups of teens to commit wrong actions to integrate in their group. This make that teenagers are involucred in big troubels, that could end in the jail or inclusive dead. This adoption may feels like a big restriction for teenagers, but it is not; the only thing that this look for teenagers is less troubles and more oportunities to be safe.

Additionally, this adoption could mean less crimes in the citiy. Currently, crimes are incresing through the years, making that the people feels without hope to come back home. When we talk about crimes, we are not talking only about deaths; we refers to crimes in general like: vandalism, theft, kidnapping, gangs, etc. If the council approve this adoption, all this troubles will be less trough the time due the strong law that this will mean. Making the place more safe and secure for he habitants.

On the other hand, this adoption could be unfair because although they are not doing anything bad, they are breaking the law. For example: My aunt works in a restaurant, and sometimes she works too late. She does not have car, then she walk to home; she arrives at home at 1 A.M or even 2 A.M. Then if the counsil approves this adoption, she will be affected because although she does not do something bad, she is breaking the law due the job. Futhermore, if you have an emergency and you are alone, you need help; then you go out to look for help. I think this are great arguments against the adoption, but in my opinion its best keep the security for the people.

In conclusion, make this adoption possible is a good way to keep the calm in the habitants of the city. Although to keep teeanagers out of trouble, making a better city for they and the new habitants",3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,7.0,6.076444625854492,6
6907AC535720,"""Stop doing that, your cousin cut his hand because he was doing the same thing"". A lot of times people say an example to make you know what would happen if you continue doing it. But, is the example the best way to influence people? Yes, an example will make you know that you are doing something bad, it will let you know what are the consequences of it, and you know that the example influence others, because you can see that your parents are the most important example in your life; they are going to make you as a person.

When you are doing something bad and the people see it, they will probably tell you an example of something that you are doing something bad or innapropiate; for example, when you are climbing a tree, your mom would tell you stop doing that, your sister broke her arm because she was climbing that tree, that is going to make you think if you are doing something good or bad. It is going to make you know that people are telling this to you, because they don't want you to have bad consequences. Another example would be that when you are drinking, somebody would tell you don't think to drive, because my uncle died because he was drunk and he had a car accident,so you will know that people are advising you, because they know that you are doing something bad. When people tell you a good example to stop doing something, it will make you know that you are doing something bad.

A lot of times you are doing something, and you don't know the consequences of your action, maybe, it can break your arm, or it can send you to the hospital; but when people tell you an example it will let you know the actions; for example, if you are listening to music very loud, you couldn't know that it can make your ears very bad, but when people tell you turn the music down, my sister's ears are very bad because she was listening to music very loud; after that you know that you better stop doing that, because it will bring you very bad consequences, and you do not want that, so you would stop. Another thing, is that knowing the consequences of your actions, could help another people; for example, if you are drinking you should know that you can not drive, if you do not drive another person will not die, because you know that you can have a car accident, and that is because people told you an example of what is going to happen if you drive while you are drunk. An example can help you to know the consequences of your actions.

A lot of people say that you are who you are because of your parents, and that is right, your parents are the most important example for you. They are going to tell you what is good and what is wrong; your parents influence you because they are your most important example, and that is what an example does, influence you, tells you what is good and what is wrong; for example, if your parents are good people, you should be a good person, but if your parents do not care about you, they do not listen to you or they treat people bad, you are going to be somebody who doesn;t listen to people, you will not care about anyone, so your parents are your most important example, because they have taught you what is good and what is wrong; and you can see again that the example influences you. The parents are your most important example and influence.

We saw that an example can make us think what is good and what is wrong, it is going to tell us the consequences of our actions, it will make you think that you are doing something bad, and we can see that the example influences you because we have our parents, we are going to be the same as them, because they are the people that is going to teach us how to act. So yea, the example is the best way to influence people.",3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,7.0,6.624160289764404,7

AAFE35314AEA,"some student to get they self-steem, believe that praising is the best way for they get the best work they ever seen but i desagree with that, because praising is not the only way you have to get the best work or the best option.

first the student must be know that he have to learn by they self how to be more confident in they life, because praising is not the only way that is gonna help then to be grates in they life they must be think how they can do they own work not just for praising to make they self-steem.

second they have to look inside of they life and think how they gonna to the best work the best studen without praising.

theer must student believe is the only way to get god happy and make good works, but that is not true, the true is that and i believe in the way you was dicipline when you was a kid in you make you own self is in how you want to make it .

another example i will like to put is that in what wey you pray, you no must praised just for the simple way you have a huge work for the school the way you must be praising is in the wey that your families is in there that is when you must be praising for your family and that can help you for your future, no for a work if you want to make a really good work you must be work hard the whole night or the whole day to make that better and the best of the class.

the most important thing of this not in how you make your decition or your self- confident is the way you train to make your self praising don't came from achievement they come for are self in what way we must want to make it,

I think that the more important thing in your life is not if you prasing ir not for any work or any kind of that i think if you gona pray is when you want to talk to god and tell him that you really need help in any ocaccion that is dificult for us.

on my conclucion i believe the dicipline get you in a way that is gonna help you in your life and in your future because with dicipline you learn how to be more confident , how to have more self-steem, and how to do the best work, is not only because few student believe that praising is gonna make your self-steem, you make you own way in how you want to make it, your self is not supposted to be the way that another person want to make you i think you must be make you own self importan for you, You can make your self confident,steem, and powerful, with dicipline and keep doing it in the best way you can,

i think the true self-steem came for how hard you work in your self is not came from what you think, i think the must important thing is in how you think you can make you own self, and some student said that, the self-steem just came from achivement i think is true in some way's, i thing they come from are inside of what we want to be in our life, and the another thing is that is true that we have to work in are self but not in a bad way, so that is what i think and believe about praising.

51109FD6CDA7,"As the students, writing is the most important skill you need during your learning. When writing, writer need to checking that their essay have enough paragraph, correct punctuation, and good word to influence reader. Your essay need the introduction, which captures the reader's attention; a few reason, which supported with specific information and example that will persuade your reader; a counterclaim, which address the different idea mistakes; a good conclusion, which bring your idea together. You also need to careful for you organize, sentences, tone, word choice. There a hundred thing you need to know for influence essay and some people believe that setting a good example by you own behavior is the best way to do it. I did believe that even with a draft, your example good or not will decide your reader's attention to the writing.

Your teacher always remind you to giving some example for you reason while you writing, but have you ever wonder why? There is the reason for it, first, giving example is the way to gain people believe, you need to give reader some fact they can base on. Your example will help people understand more about your writing, image it inside they brain. It build a good base to support you reason and make your essay easy to read. Also yourself know every detail what happen with your thinking, your feeling and your action; reader can also feel it and your essay become more real. When they feel real, they will more believe you story, understand your opinion an learn from it.

The second reason why you should use a good example by your own behavior is it help you gain reader interested. Giving example light up your essay,make people getting more interested while reading your story. Reader feel attractive to read since they want to know what will happen and how you solve those problem. You can use a fit tone to tell your story make it more lively. After reading those example, people might having a good look about you, knowing you more through those example. They can look at you behavior and decide to trust you, that is when you success influence your reader.

But some people don't believe so, they think there was more better way such as using a nice introduce or a good conclusion to influencing others. A philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer said: ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" As you using good example, you can give as much as you want to make others believe at you. It the strongest weapon you have to attack reader defense, believe. To have a good essay you need to complete every part of it so example is not the main thing of the essay but it the only thing you can use persuade people. If you want them read, write a capture introduction; if you want them stay, give then a good reason; but if you want them believe, give them real example.

As long as you live, you will go through different thing, different people, and different thinking. Each of your experiment can become a good example as you persuade others. Using a good example also help you writing got a better score. So when you write, you should setting a good example by your behavior to help you influence people better. Good example will gain reader believe and interest on you writing, give students a better score, and influence essay.",2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.775020122528076,6

56F53F2EC7EE,"""Some schools have a program that pairs older students with younger students."" Some people believe that there are good side effects for both sides because; the older students will help out the younger, there will be less bullying, and finally both sides will start to understand each other.

People believe that this program to pair older and younger students together is good for us,

because the older can help out the younger. The older students already went through that grade so they can help understand the subject or the topic better, they can break it down to you in a way that teacher does not know how to. The younger student can help the older by telling them how to relax and try to be a kid again, how to not stress.

The other reason why people say this program is good for students is that studies have shown that there is less bullying in schools after the school tried the program. Sense sometimes in schools the older students bully the younger the principle decided to pair them up to help them understand each other and it worked, there was way less bullying in that school after that.

The final reason why people think that the program has good side effects is because both sides will start to understand each other. Now the younger students will understand why the older ones are always grumpy and tired, on the other side the older students will understand why younger ones are always so energetic, annoying and are not stressed about anything thing yet .

There are good side effects to this program of pairing older and younger students, I believe that that if we had this program in every school there will be less negativity between people. People believe that this program is really good for us because the older will help out the younger, there will be less bullying, and finally both sides will start to understand each other. So yes there are lots of good side effects to this program. ",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.914671421051025,7
C2F7A800FCB1,"How would you feel if you only have to go to school for a four-day school? I support the four-day week school within the two hours expanded. Because it will conserve energy and its going to improve many things. Students will take an extra academic and they will learn more thing each day because they will have more time at school, and people like be in school for education. It will improve are environment and it going to make a change in are lives, are environment must be taking care of it because we live in it.

First, Conserving energy it will help as to maintain a clean environment and there would be less pollution. It would be nice for a country to conserve energy, so they can keep animals safe. Pollution can get people sick, and pollution is caused by consuming a lot of energy. Energy can harm many thinks around as like nature, animal, people. Even conserving resources like food could reduce the use of energy. Reducing the energy the government world reduce the tax on others re courses. If energy is not used for just one day it would be amazing people would spent time as a family.

Second, If students only go to school for four-day of school and within the two hours extended they can take a extra class or academic. It will improve there learning faster, because they will be at school for ten hours. Students will have more free time to work on something in school or they can as for help if they need too. They like to stay longer in school so they wont go to their homes, and other student love being at school, because they feel like school is like there second home. If a student takes an extra class he or she might able to graduate with a high degree for school. Student could spent more time with there councilor to talk about something or if they have issues.

Finally, By not using a lot of energy it keeps are environment clean and fresh. Are environment is important to as because with bad air we could die. It is important to many people to conserve resources, so they can keep a beautiful environment. The more clean we keep are environment the healthier are earth is going to be. If everyone started to conserve resources people could be much cleaner. The less people use energy and supplies the better is is going to be fro the community. people would like to have fabulous environment.

People should consider the four-day week school because it will help them conserve many things and it will make a batter improvement on the society. Society is important for the humans, because the more people conserving energy and supplies the batter it's going to be for are well being. If schools are a four-day week it would be reliable for many people and plus it going to save a lot of energy and supplies.          ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,6.0,5.720763206481934,6
176EC75DBB38,"The program that allows high school students to graduate in three years instead of four years is a good idea. It is a good idea because it can be easy for the students to safe an year and start the college early. why do they graduate early?

The fact most of the student do this is to safe a year and they can take a break for an year or they can do some work or start college early. There are many advantages and disadvantages of graduating high school in three years. The advantages of finishing high school early are you do not have to go to school the fourth year, students can do either take a break for an year or they can do some work or you can start filling applications for the college. The disadvantage or finishing high schools early is that you would not have enough time to work on something else, you will not be able to take any electives which are important and helpful for the student which can help in help college life, students will have to take classes in the evening sometimes after school or online. ,students will not have enough time to hangout with friends, they have to work extra hard in three years and they can not play any sport because they will have enough classes to graduate and etc. For example if i have to finish high school in three years, then i won't have enough time to give my friends and family because i have to work hard to pass the classes. After finishing high school then either i can do some work or take a break from high school or I can start college. Graduating in four years is not bad but gradutaing in three years will save some time. Mostly students choose to graduate in four years because they do not have to study a lot and they can gave enough time to do other stuff like play sports or hang out with friends.

Mostly students who have completed high school in three years instead of four years they suggest that it can safe a lot of time. In my opinion people should graduate in three years instead of four, because it can save a lot of time. Students who graduate in three years are lucky because they got an extra year to think that what they have to do in future or they can do some work. Mostly students who graduate in three years they start applying to colleges and they then take a rest. A student can also complete the college in three years too. More then half of the students graduate in three years because it is worthwhile. If the student start college one year early, so the student have so many advantage to graduate from the college one year early and he can do some work or he can start applying for the jobs a year early or he can apply to several jobs. Graduating in three years will be hard but it is hard because you will have to take classes after school or in the evening, so it will be hard for the student to manage the time but it will be then easier for him in the future. Gradutaing in three years, students can not take any electives and thats kind of not good because elective help student in the college .I personally recommend everyone to graduate in three years so they can save one year, so they can take a break or go to college one year early.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,7.0,6.868893623352051,7
699259F14D89,"Schools that offer distance learning is a open option for student's. Can it be beneficial for student's to attend school classes at home as well as video chatting for conferences? My opinion on this statement is distance learning is not beneficial, Certain kids take advantage of online schooling to not attend school and to stay at home. Most few kids can't learn their material through computer and prefer being in a classroom and being taught verbally. Everyone's learning skills are different.

Online classes are like books on a computer and having to learn all your materials on your own. Attending school will help you learn more things about all your subjects. When having trouble with any subject you will have teachers and other students to go to when needed help.

Distance learning may effect your social life. Socializing with other student's at school is a great way to make friends. Going to school and having a routine every morning will help you to be independent and having you'r own responsibilities, it will prepare you as you get older. Although waking up in the morning can be harsh and very tiring, you must think about the future you want to have.

School is where you have opportunity's for many things. Doing online classes won't be like going to school where they give you opportunity's to go on field trips and have fun at the dances or participating in sports and clubs. If attending school you can make childhood memories to tell and the long run.

Distance learning is not beneficial you lose a lot of opportunity's and enjoyments. I have to strongly disagree with doing online classes at home.

D8D90E042134,"In my personal opinion, I think that students should decide on their own. I mean if they're eight-graders, they should be smart enough and decide on their own on what they want, or don't want to do. For me, I would choose helping the community, 'cause if you think about it, your actually doing it for your own goods, maybe in some points your not, but most of them from peoples personal experiment's basically, your doing it for your community and your country, the world and people that are around you. What i would do, I would make a list from easiest, to hardest on helping the community, and start from the easiest because at first, your not used to it, and you need to learn how to be responsible for your things, and for what you do. For example, I'll pick, helping students in your classrooms. Then, I might start tutoring my cousins or neighbors, something to start of with, like a practice. If I'll see or think that I'm good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. Later on, I'll be a famous tutor! If I'll be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then they'll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now I'll have a job! So basically, I made my own personal carrier just for helping the community! What I'm trying to say, helping you community isn't as bad. If your one of the lucky ones, you'll make your self a carrier, if not, keep on trying!

DE921CECE21A,"Do we accomplish more by constantly doing something? Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" He believed that more would be accomplished if there was something being done most of the time, I agree with this. Accomplishing a task motivates some people to do more, accomplishing more, It also helps us learn more about ourselves. Although, people believe that being in-active is better because it provides less stress and more free time, It also keeps us from succeeding our daily tasks and influences us to be lazy.

Being busy would require us to be awake and alert of what we are doing. In some cases, after finishing up a task, all people want to do is move on and rest. In other cases, people choose to knock out more work that they have in mind. Having this kind of mindset it good, because it allows a person to have more energy and to keep themselves busy. A personal experience would be when I was so tired one afternoon, but I had to keep myself from napping because I had homework due. After I completed that one homework, I was too awake to even sleep; So I decided to knock out other work I had in the meantime. In the end I received a better grade from that class and I had chores finished from that week so I didn't have to do anything in the weekend. To conclude this paragraph, when I accomplished one thing I ended up accomplishing more than I expected.

We all have our different ways of living and learning. One way to help you learn more about yourself is by keeping busy. You learn how to manage your own time, you learn about how you react to a hectic environment which can help for future references, and You learn how your own mind works. For example, When I was in my sister's sixteenth birthday party, I also had school to focus on, homework to get done, and Sol's to focus on. For me it was a pretty hectic schedule, but I learned how to respond and manage my time. Learning how to manage my time came in handy when my sixteenth birthday came along. Everyone has a different way of living and learning, and keeping myself busy taught me a lot about how I live and learn.

Although being in active provides us with less stress and more free time, which is not always a bad thing, It influences us to not only be more lazy, but to procrastinate. To procrastinate put off something that should be done, To leave it for that moment and do it later, as you repeatedly tell yourself, but you occasionally never end up doing it. Procrastination can lead you to become more and more unprepared. Being unprepared isn't the best way to live. Having more free time can have it's positive outcomes, but also its negatives. For example, who wants to accomplish nothing now, only to do the same in the future? People may believe being in-active is a better way to live because it relieves you from stress and work, but doing nothing can follow with other bad habits that can lead to worse in your future.

In conclusion, we accomplish more by keeping busy. Keeping ourselves busy can help us prepare for our future, and help us learn more about ourselves and how to respond to a hectic lifestyle. Although some people would like to live a lifestyle doing absolutely nothing, that wouldn't be the case for all. Others would prefer to accomplish more by staying active and helping themselves prepare for whatever comes next.                     ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,8.333222389221191,8
7921F1381801,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attand classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Yes, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Less take me as an example; I had personal problems before, and It was auwefull. What If It was so bad that I couldn't go to school?! Some students are just not good at school, and just prefer learning from home online or by video conferencing. Other students that gets in trouble all the time are just better off learning from home. There, at home, there is no one to to fit with. You get your work done and you move on. their will be no more trouble.

Most of the times our parents say that going to school and socialism is good for us. Is that true?! Is that the case?! Well I am not sure about that, but what I do know is that I think we students should have the options to decide what we really are confortable with, and our parents should help us with that. Anyways, It's not like people at home are doing less work than people at school. We all are doing the same work, depanding on our grades. We all need to turn in our work on time or it will be counted late, same test, same quiez everything. The only differance between people that are taking online or video conferencing from people at school is that they are not going to school. They aren't in a classroom.

C5E45F477A84,"Have you ever met someone, or an interviewer, and show a good or bad impression to them? People think that first impression can be changed because everybody has a second chance. While others think that first impression can not be changed because it shows who you are. I agree to the motion that first impression are impossible to change because it shows your personality, your attitude and who you are.

Firstly, first impressions are impossible to change because it shows your personality. I had a friend, who dressed inappopriartely to an interview for her job. But to her surprise she did not get the job because of how she dressed. Also after a while, she couldn't get any job elsewhere. This means that whenever you go somewhere, you should dress appropriately, check how you use your tone with others, so people will know that you are a good person, respectful, can take responsibiliy for your actions and shows how mature you are. Not only does first impressions show your personality, however, it shows your attitude.

Additionally, showing your attitude is most likely impossible to change. I remember I used to disrespect, fight and insult others when they did something to me I didn't like or even if they needed help from me. I met this old lady and she asked for my help then I told her that I didn't want to and insulted her, then she said to me I am going to have a hard time in life but i didn't take what sh said seriouly and left. As a result of what happened, as I grew up, I tried to change but couldn't because when something goes bad and I knew it was not me, they will all mention my name. And I wish there was someone there to offend me. And thats when I remembered what the old lady told me, I wanted to go ask for forgiveness but unlucky for me she went to heaven and now am left with her curse. Which gives me this conclusion that always respect everyone you see even if you don't know them.

First impressions also shows the kind of person you really are.

Furthermore, your impressions shows who you are. Not long ago, this was this lady on the news. When i heard the news it shocked me because she went to a store, picked an ice cream from the fridge, licked it, and put it back in the fridge without paying for it. This obviously shows that, she ruined her reputation in public and everywhere. Now everyone knows who she really is. Not only did it ruined reputation but she brought a shame to herself, her family, and also her native country. First impressions are impossible to change.

Lastly, it is valid that first impressions can be changed because everyone has a second chance. But not really because sometimes your impressions towards someone stays the same even if you change. Others will think you are not your self today and also others will think it's a good thing but not everyone depending on what impression you made on your first time meeting. So I say that first impressions likely impossible to change.

In a Nutshell, showing your character, who you are, and your behaviour are impossible to change on your first impression. Mostly first impressions are not easy to change. Would you on your first impression be respectful or disrespectful, appopriate or inoppopriate, and be willing to take responsiblity of the concequences of you on seeing someone older than you, are you?",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,8.0,7.617362976074219,8
AADAFDCD9944,"Disagree about extending the school days two hour long and be a four day school week, the reason I disagree with this event is beacause if the school extend the day 2 hours can mess up the student schedule after school ends. The students may have to reschdule some of the things that may have to do after schools end and some student can't changed there schdule at all also more stress can happen to the students.

Some student have things to do after school like they have a jobs go to after school ends, I have a friend that has a job he go to after school end and to go right away or he will be late for work that can lead to him fired. I have art school after schools ends and I need to be there on time to finish part of my art work that help me get in to college. Some of the student may have go to an importent event that has a time on it like a funeral in a diffrent state and that can lead to get behind in class work.

More work may over stress the student mind and they might fall behind in things that might be inmported, the student may have less time to sleep to get work done on time beacuse there schdule maybe get more cramp with work to do, then they were before the school have added one more hour of school day. And the classes may have more work to do in class that can lead to more stress to the students and more homework to finish off at home.

9271B11A158B,"Distance learning school does not offer many personal benefits than you think, because there's some difficulties that people can have taking classes from their home. It can be stressful and one reason is: if someone does not understand something, there's nobody to help them answering their questions, another reason is when they have to treat with more people the doesn't know how to treat them, and the last reason is that they have to be responsible with their schedule, starting class time and finish it at time, but sometimes people has more things to do and the schedule can be hard to respect.

People take classes as we take attending the school, some classes are more harder than other classes, if they are strugguling with some topic or lesson they have to look for options that help them to understand as seraching on the internet, watch videos on yotube because they doesn't have more people around them as a teacher or classmates to help them. Having more people around us is always good because sometimes they explain in another way we understand better but people attending classes from home does not have that adventage.

Treating people is another fact that can affected to them, because there's many type of cultures and if they does not have classmates to treat, when they have to be outside, they are going to feel rare, shy or even disrespectful. Sometimes can be in another way, some students prefer to attend school because they like to share with more people but parents prefer that they take everyting from school at home so studens can be really affected, causing that they loose the share feeling and started to be an alone person.

School Online has its own shedule, students has to be responsible with that. Starting class on time is important so they can cover everything for that day and they can finish the class on time. But they does not have just the school responsability, they have more things to do, and if they doesn't have enough time to do everything, they can suffer stress, and stress carries many things with it, like acne, headache, insomnia, etc.

An important fact for life is to have good relation with different kind of people, this is one of the problem for students who attend school online.

I would agree because some acts of honesty can really mean a lot to someone. An old proverb says honesty is the best policy because it is the key of telling the truth and it can also create new friend ships in life.

I would agree that honesty is the best policy, but if you miss treat honesty it can be very lethal to your trust with people. To lose someone's honesty is very hard I have seen car crash which someone got severely hurt and the person who crash into him won the court battle because he was not showing honesty. My father has told me honesty is a great part in peoples life. My father has told me stories were his friends have seen people get robed and their honesty has helped find who did it and convict the criminal. Even just a little bit of honesty can help anyone. But when you use honesty you should never use it in a way that might hurt someone's feelings. I once was playing a game and the opposing team was not being very honest which hurt some of the kids feeling's on my team. But a persons honesty can always change at all times. I once had a friend who was never honest but changed through out his life and started to realize why honest is so important. I even have made new friend ships in life just from being honest. As we can see you might be able to get something from being honest.

If you are always honest people respect you. I have been in instances ware honesty has created respect for me. When you show some form of honesty it creates a good environment around you which can make good relationship you. But when people use honesty to hurt your feelings by not being honest it makes you feel like you just have been hit by a train or it feels like you have been betrayed. Once I was walking down my street and saw that there was lots of police cars out side one my neighbors houses. I heard that she got robed a couple months ago and found a witness that saw who the thief was because the witness was honest with the police it helped find who did the crime. As I can see honesty is the best policy.

In conclusion, no matter the incident that happened you always should be honest. Even in the future your actions can be justified from your honesty.

584A4BB1E954,"Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed ? I think students should designed. students can do this well.

One reason why summer projects from students. Because if the student designed their project they can choose their projects. For example, some students need an essay project but teachers give harder projects for students and they can't do this projects. And some students not have idea about the projects from teachers but when students choose their projects they have good ideas about their projects. However, some teachers did not like to students choose their projects .This is not the only reason summer projects from students is good.

Some may argue summer projects from teachers is good. This is because the teachers have more information about summer projects and they know what kind of projects is better for students. However, some students not have information about summer projects and they did not like to complete the summer projects from teachers in the summer.

In conclusion, I think the students need to choose their projects because if they choose their projects they like the summer projects and they really want to complete their projects in the summer vacation and they have good ideas about the projects.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,6.0,5.688146114349365,6
2DC55C3EFD7D,"To conserve energy and sources, some businesses have adopted four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? No, i am no agree with that because that is to much work and that can be a lot of work for your brain. Also that can affect you in the feature with any disease.

Some people think that is the same thing the only difference is that you have one day off. But that is not mean that they can conserve energy and sources. They do the same thing and that is a bad idea, because they have to think about the students also that can frustrate the students doing work every four days per ten hours. The benefit of that is that you have a day free for do other thing like homework.

In facts, there is so many ways to conserve energy and sources, because that is a benefit for the companies. They would earn more money, but the thing is that the personal who is working with any of those businesses they are working very hard;however, in the school are cases of the students who works after school and that idea of expend two hours can affect their jobs, because many times they work like four or five hours and they leave early because they know that they have to do the homework. In case that they leave more late of school they may feel tired of know that they have to work and do more stuff, their brain can got tired too. Because not always have an opportunity that their parents can buy all the things that their child needs.

To conserve energy: is something that we use in the school and that is necessary for homework not always we need energy for a homework but we used most of the times, because today the technology is advanced. We know that the things are not easy but we always try our best, but not for that we are gonna study or work ten hours each day.

Resources: is important because we need, money, energy, and products like food. Study two more hours each day then the normally that can affect like a students and teachers.

In conclusion, two hours difference can be a benefit, because you have a one extra day off, but it is more hard study more hours than normal, but all your work always has a positive thing. Also are other ways to conserve energy and resources because just for that you have to work or study more than you normally do. In the future that can affect you with any disease or any other thing. There is some benefits and disadvantages, but we can do all that we need to do or all that we have to do.

7F3519884176,"The pursuit of success has been discussed by many knowledgeable people for a long time. Nobody is perfect but there always be someone who is more successful than others. Although some people believe that being failure is not important role in the pursuit of success, nevertheless, the important role is failure that plays in the pursuit of success because people always learn something new when they make a mistake, and they tell that lesson for others which leads them into more success.

To begin, when people make a mistake, they always try to fix it by learning something important from it. For instance, there is a girl who wants to make a tryout in basketball team. She is afraid of cannot making the team. Her scare leads her not to try. When the tryout comes, she tried but did not show her strength and could not make the team because of her scare. She is sure now that she will make the team next year without any problem. She makes the team. This shows that, the girl learns her lesson that she cannot be afraid or unsure about what she wants to do. Clearly, if some people never make a mistake and never fail, that people do not try anything new which means they never meet their success.

Furthermore, when people learn something important from their mistake, they start to tell the lesson for others which lead them into more success. For example, teachers teach and tell students what is right and what is wrong by their experience and stupendous knowledge. Students learn it and find the pursuit of success while teachers are going successful. Teachers make many intelligent, talented, successful young people which is very important work for the future. When people tell things over and over again to others, they start to remembering them more which support them not to make same mistake. This proves that, helping people and leading them into right direction help everyone. But the most important thing is to tell them not to quit, stop, and lose their enthusiasm because of their fail. Clearly, success comes by itself when people doing right thing for one and another and not being quitter.

The important role is failure that plays in the pursuit of success because people learn something amazing from their mistake when they do something wrong and they tell that lesson for others which leads them into more success. Failure teaches people what do to next, and how to do it right, and by remembering the mistake people start to tell the others and never do same mistake again and again. In conclusion, people never should lose their hope, dream, and their enthusiasm because of failure. They should learn from it and help others to not do it.

students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Although students aren't expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school they maybe don't like the career but his/her father/Mather work there. But students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school they like career, they have the inforech about the career.

The first examples is they like career. Same people see them sale they can do one. but in this thing the can make big different. for examples

Generic_Name is one of the bast scorer player in the word, but before he came to what he know,his doctor tale him you can play score any wooer because he is sack.

D594B486E6B5,"People that have their faces in front of a screen with there back slouching with the help of technology. Technology is advancing year by year and month by month. When teens or adults get there hands on the new technology they will spend weeks or even months in their rooms, trying to figure out what the device can and cannot do. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives, because it can lead to bad communication skills, health problems and being inactive.

However, not everyone agrees with this statement. Some people claim that technology has a positive effect on peoples lives. Neverless, this position overlooks an important point, mainly that technology cannot change how much human contact you have or do not have. For example, my friend she cannot drive, but she can have items get delivered to her; books, food, and clothes. Furthermore, when the delivery person came she did not know the proper way to greet him. Do to technology, people can have bad communication skills and they don't know how to communicate with people when they are in contact with someone.

Moreover, by being isolated, technology can lead to bad communication skills. When someone gets the newest device or game, they want to know how it works. By learning what the device or video game can and cannot do, they usually spend a month learning how the device works or how to unlock the next level in the game. For instance, my brother got a new video game, he has isolated himself in his room, so he can beat the level and go on to the next. When he was finish with the level, he had a hard time communicating properly. Before he played his video game, his grammar was good; now it wasn't. For example he would use the wrong past and present tense. Thus, by staring at the screen for so long, he has got very inactive.

Additionally, sitting on the couch or in a chair with a screen in front of you, every day for a whole month can make a person inactive. People that are inactive can become very lazy, and they intend on making a lot of mistakes when they are talking. They can also gain weight or have health problems. To illustrate, sitting in front of a screen while eating junk food can cause you to gain weight and can lead to health issues. During spring break, my friend had nothing to do, he was on his laptop everyday eating junk food.

Now he has to be careful on what he can and cannot eat, because he will get heart burn.

If he does not stop eating unhealthy foods in front of a screen he will gain more weight and have more health issues.

He does not know how to ask for help; he needs someone to push him to go outside and enjoy the weather, instead of being in front of a screen all day long.

Based on this argument, one must conclude that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives. Technology can effect us in many different ways; bad communication skills, health problems and being inactive. In conclusion, technology can change human contact in a negative way.",3.5,4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.968990802764893,8

One reason why high school shouldn't offer programs that allow high school students to graduate with in three years is because having another year of high can help the students out a lot. It gives them more time to improve their GPA. The GPA are points to let you know how good or bad they are doing in school and students should really be looking out for there GPA. Also, if the student GPA is good enough it can get them into a really good college.

In addition, the second reason why high school shouldn't offer programs that allow high students to graduate with in three years is because there are students that still don't know know kind of career they want to have for their future. Students nowadays have really trouble on deciding on what they want to work as and knowing that they have another year, gives them more time to think.

Finally, the third reason why high school shouldn't offer programs that allow high students to graduate with in three years is because some students struggle and have a really difficult time to stay focus in school. Students start to lacks off, getting lazy, and not giving effort. Also, students get to follow behind in their classes. When students are following behind in there classes, it takes them a little more time to catch up with their classmates. Some students fail and they have to retake the class all over again when they should of passed it the first time. This is the reason why students need a traditional four years of high school.

In conclusion, it is not a good idea for students to finish high in three years. Students need a traditional four years of high school. Students want to improve there GPA.

642E44E8DD25,"I would like to visit a engineering work place, or company. I would like to learn all about planning how do build something, and to they come up with good building ideas. What is the most hard part that a engineer has to take very series?.

If i was able do visit one of these companies i would get very happy. My mom told me that this is a good job, but it's a risk that people that want to have this job have to take in order do get pay very well. One of my teacher in Generic_School his dad was a engineer he told me that his dad didn't like math because it was to hard, but he got a job in the engineering company and he good checks. This teacher that i'm talking about didn't like science, or math and at the end he ended up teaching math, and science he is very good at it, and a very nice teacher too. I think all of this that i talked about is teaching me that i need to have good grades in my prealgebra class.

Engineering for me is easy do say, but i wanna experience does hard problems. On Saturdays and Sundays i work with my dad. My dads lets me cut the grass and it not easy, he keeps telling me to get good grades, so i don't have be like him all day in those hot days. I guess that working all day in a very hot summer is not food. My dad taught me that working under the sun is very hard a it makes your back hurt he told me that i need to be better them him. When i'm older i would get a good job, and i would help my dad, and my mom even dough they told me that when get older they are going to go back to El Salvador , but i'm still going to help them.

I think that i would give engineering a chance if not i'm going to find another job. thats ones of my job, or company i would like to visit if it was close to my school. Another company, or job would be frying airplanes i is good job i o ways wanted to fly one, but its do hard plus i don't think i'm going to go to college i think that this jobs are just to hard for me to learn especially me it take a long time for me to remember something. I think i can make it if only i put mu effort on it. My teachers tell me that i'm smart only when i want to, they o ways tell me to give it a try and i o ways ended up learning it sometimes i think that teachers sometimes understand students and hoe they feel. I get mad when don't understand something. i haven't done good in 7, and 8th grade. I think that all of these happen because i made new friends. I think that flying airplanes is much harder then learning engineering, but the only thing i need to do if put my effort in everything

I think that is not a bad idea do have some company around schools they should make field trips, kids could ask question that they would like to ask. This essay made me think more about what job would i like to do in the future. I think that i would stay with the engineering job i would like to put all my thoughts in to it and get a good college degrees, and get the job that i dream off. I think that my dream wold come true, and if it does or doesn't well i guess i would learn another thing i pay to go to college and get that job. i will try to make all my family happy and help all of them.

F1DF4F89F70D,"Do you think that too much oil in your food affect your health, or it improve the ability of how you work at school? I think food that contains too much oil makes you get sick and that's what we have right now, but others think different and they have their reasons too. Although some say that the school's cafeteria should not change their food because the food that they are offering right now is especially made to make students work better actually, the school's cafeteria should change their food because it gives students more variation to eat and by having a healthier food less students will get sick.

Those who think that the school's cafeteria should not change their food have their reasons. One reason is that the food that they are offering makes students work better; this is because it has a lot of oil. Scientific studies say that oil awake people, and make people do their usually activies better. Also, students who have their test after lunch, and they have eat something that contains a lot of oil; they tend to get better scores than those who didn't eat at lunch; this might be because some of them can't think with the stomach empty, or it can be because oil really helps them concentrate, who knows right. The oil food doesn't sound that bad, isn't? but I will tell you next what is what I think that is bad about it.

There are many people who think that the school's cafeteria should change their food. This is because they have their reasons, one reason is to make students eat healthier; this will help prevent students get sick. There are many sicknesses caused by oil, and one of them is cholesterol; cholesterol can kill people if you don't know how to take care of it. Also, by preventing students get sick they will not lose any day of school, and that will help them have good attendance and they will not get lost in their important classes. For example: Science, Math and History.

Another reason to change the cafeteria's food is that it will give more variation for students to eat. This might sound simple, but by giving them more variation to eat; students will feel more free to explore food that they don't know. Also, students will feel more comfortable as if they were at home because you know that when you are at home food variate and that makes it fun. moreover, Variation of food will attract those who are more likely to stay out of the cafeteria; maybe they don't like the food that we have right now, and they are hoping that the cafeteria change the food. I think that by changing the food in the cafeteria will make a good impact in the school.

In conclusion, I think that the principal of my school should change the cafeteria's food because the variation of food will make a good impact in students who don't like to eat at lucn right now, and it will also prevent the majority of students to get sick. Eventhough those who don't want to change the food had a good reasons; ""The food that we have right now is made to make students be more active"". I think that the reasons to change the food are more productive for the improvement of our school.             ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,6.0,7.627328395843506,8

First of all, Big tasks can be finish perfectly, while working as a qroup. If every individual person in a qroup has their own skill they show their best in a important task. People who were work as a qroup claimed that their work could not be perfect if they worked alone. Because tasks and duties con be done perfectly by working as a qroup.

It allow us to communicate, shop online, play games, learn and many more extravagant stuff. The one million dollar question is has this limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives?

Technology has had a positive effect on people's lives. The use of technology does limit us to human contact but, it also allow us to discover new innovations and learning new things. If we would've never had a little bit of limitation to create these amazing things with technology we would still be living in the era of Ice Age . I understand that technology may have a negative effect on are limitation to others but, if we use it right we could meet insanity of humans with use of technology.

Communication is something very vital around the whole world. A phone, computer, Smart - watch , or social media are major things we use to contact with others. Because cell phones we can be in Virginia and text or talk to someone in South America or anywhere in the world. Not everyone has the money or time travel to see a person or family member. Innovations like this make families or people come closer when they most need them. For example, a holiday is coming up and you wanna see your family . But, you don't have any money to go see your love one's . So your best bet is to call, face - time, Skype, or other social media.

Learning is the base of are life. The more information we get taught the more we learn. Technology plays a big role on us learning to are highest potential. Because of technology you don't have attend a school ; you can take online classes if you don't have the time to attend a school. From the comfort of your home you could even graduate to become a great scientist. Inventions like this allow us to learn and communicate with each other without having human contact.

Technology is something that everyone uses on a daily bases. Kids nowadays as young as 3 are able to use a cell phone or tablet with no problem.

Having a four- day week of school, work will most likely make a deference in the world and everyone.

I as a teen wouldn't mind staying at school for 2 extra hours we get to learn more on stuff we probably don't understand in any class we would even have the chance to turn in stuff that we our missing, it benefits anyone you just have to learn how to take advantage of it.

Some teens have two jobs like I do

I would be the happiest person if there was only four- days of work,school. a lot of us don't have the energy to work or go to school for five days in a row and need a day to just not do nothing but sleep and wait for the next day to go back to work but you'll wake with much more energy without waking up in a bad mood and be in a good mood because you got a day off and extra sleep.

A lot of teens have chores around the house as of cleaning, wash clothes have errands to run for their parents and take care of their siblings plus feed or taking them to practice or their games if their parents can't there are many stuff we do some kids, teens were force to grow up at such a youg age and have responsibilites to do out of work, school and not many people understand or know that.

On the other hand not a lot of people would like the idea of working or going to school for four- days and staying a two extra hours everyone has a different perspective and they would prefer going five days in a row on their normal schedule, not a lot of people would love the change as much as I would.

In my opinion I think it would be great for the health of the school and student to have a healthy food during school hours, one main reason is bacause it keep our body,healthy strong in which we can reflex our education, It will benefit all the students mainly the ones that are in PE class,eating healthy can improves more day of life and better human body, eathing halthy can prevent you from disease and probably some virus.

by eathing healthy you will not only will be able to be on a good fit you can also feel good and with feeling good about your self means more thant anything in this world, my opinion about this i agree with this change and i would like to see more plans for the upcoming futre years.

every plas have good and bad opinions many student at school have said and have their own opinion, Many of them dont like to eat halthy they just wnat to eat and enjoy their life at the fullest, which is reasenable and i undestand they point, we all know that the food that make our body get fat and get worse is the bad type food but we all love that kind of food, is delicius and it taste great for example pizza, hamburgers and all those kidn of food.

This is the opinion of some educators that think the students dont need a long vacations ,because they cannot retain the learned in the past year, some students think the same .The system to the long long vacation for students in high school can be a very problematic because they are start the adultlife and need time off for live.

The idea that the students's vacations need are more short is bad because the students in high school needs long period of vacation for find their firts job, some students need travel to other country for visit their family and need a long vacations; if the students not have a good long vacations they can stressed and have other nervous problems.

For this situation to improve that the vacation are very short is impossible because not all students have a same system to live and some need time to find independitzation, some enjoy with their family and other can study in their homes, in other words the students need explore the world and this only can possible when have time in vacations the rest of the year they can study.

Educators and other people that think the system of short vacations need understand that before they was a students and they also was need vacation for forget all thing and enjoy the life.

The other side for take postion in this issue is that the short bacations are goof for not forget the learned in old classes.

Some people think that the student need a long periods of vacation specifically in summer , but this is bad because the student only need study and the student cannot retain the information for long time and they need more time in the school for learn more thing and repeat the learned in past years.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,5.457401275634766,5
A1CA186114A1,"I disagree for the school to have to make you take an art, music, or drama class by a large amount it wouldn't be good. I remember when I was young at Generic_School, in the 9th grade, the students were forced to take a class of either of these. Back when I was young, me being a junior now, I thought it was really fun but to come and think of it now, it didn't help me at all and I learned nothing from taking a music class. It is basically useless to have one of these classes to be in your schedule. Having art, drama, or music every day in one school semester seems dreadful. Taking these classes instead of having a real class takes away chances you have in high school and would take away from exploring different lifestyles.

Students shouldn't have to take an art, music, or drama class, it wouldn't be in any way helpful for them to take up a slot in their schedule and put a barrier for creating new chances you can have with other classes. Art, drama and music should be treated like electives, just like they always have been they are meant to be an elective for a reason because you shouldn't have to take them by force. Many students would go crazy, for the fact that they are not being able to take a class that will actually help them get to a big college just cause the schools makes them take a class that should be treated as an elective. Many students in school would be basically forced to even take a class that they don't like and wish they wouldn't have to take.

Having the students in school take a class that isn't needed would decrease the exposure in careers that should be explored, just by not taking a class that could expose them to more careers and choices because one of those classes are in the way, High school is for taking chances and making yourself take classes of what you want to be and get yourself to the next level in life. Taking those chances away from students is very unfair and just plain horrible for students that want to strive and be a good person in life. Generally, I personally do not think that schools should have the need to put you in a class that you don't need and still put it in your schedule by force.

You could might say what if the student does not know what they want to be in life. By having these classes it could open up their view on many different things of what they want to be in life and explore new careers. In my opinion it would decrease the point of views students have in school to explore and find new careers that they could maybe find as their dream job. The point of having music, art, or drama isn't ideal to many students, many of them in fact, would hate having it. The reasoning to this is that most students are very wanting to only focus on actual school based classes to help them with their future, they don't want classes that'll just waste their time taking it.

In conclusion, having to take art, drama or music classes such as what they would be referred to as electives, is not anywhere near to useful for anyone interested in striving for the best. Remembering to back to when I was young, may seem to as it would be great to have but in all honesty it wasn't great at all. Although, there might be some good points in having any of these three classes, the big points are not giving great career exposure in these classes no one is going to find their passion in music, art, or drama. Taking away opportunities from students by having them take classes that aren't important not even a little to them is inhumane, by stopping them to get great success in what they want to do in their daily life. Music, art, and drama aren't helpful in any way and should always be counted as an elective they should not move it to where you have to take it in your semester class.",4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,8.0,7.986405849456787,8
83FD2977A14D,"An Author by the name of Ralph Waldo Emerson said ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Some people might agree with Ralph Emerson while other don't. In my opinion I agree with Emerson's statement.

Many people tend to have a job. When someone first gets hire they are mostly likely to stay in that same position for years. After working there for so long you have master your job. Emerson is try to say that if you don't get some that is above your position you will not grow and learning how to do a other job or a task.

For example,when I first start my job at Pizza Hut I had no clue on what I was doing. As my coworker were teaching me I learned super fast and I got a hang of it. Months past by I was able to teach my self on how to use the cash draw all by my self just by seeing how my coworker were doing it.

FA63EE28501A,"Does true self-esteem come from praises or does it come from achievement? It's come from earning achievement, There's only so much praises can do if they aren't earning anything. Therefore the harder they work,the more they achieve. their self-esteem will keep rising and then they start believing in themselves more.

Also other believe that praises for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. I agree with there opinion,I believe that there should be goals to reach and you must try your hardest to achieve. Their's always the chance the chance of failing but that just means to keep pushing, to fix the mistakes. And when you finally achieve your goal it makes you feel so much better about yourself. Also that builds you up for harder task.

Therefore some believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. which I believe in too,feeling better about yourself works more when you have earned something. Also it can be anything but as long you give it your all,and achieve what is meant to be achieve. Your self-esteem is going to be built up knowing that you achieve something.

Next I don't believe in just praising someone no matter how good the job was works like that. Because you keep praising that they could do so much better on,it's just going to make the feel like they already got the job done,when they can do so much better. Praise their work when they tired there hardest,so then they can keep trying there hardest to achieve goals no matter what. That's how i believe that praising should be done and how to build self-esteem to make whoever try to best on anything, to not give just half but to give there all.

Finally does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement? It's come from earning achievement,so they know they give it everything they had to earn that achievement. praises work when you praise there best work so they can keep on trying there best on everything. It's takes them believing in themselves so they can earn achievement to build their self-esteem.      ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,7.0,5.778318881988525,6
3F00345B8BA6,"Afterschool homework club is the best idea possible! The reason why I think afterschool homework club is the best idea is because it can help students finish their homework earlier, and it can also be good for students who need extra help in some classes they aren't doing very well in.

First of all,

I think afterschool homework club is an amazing idea because some students are never able to do homework at home because they have siblings that constantly bother them and never give them time to do their homework, or they're just not motivated to do homework at home. Also, I think students aren't motivated to do work at home because they don't have anyone to push them to do their work.

Another reason, why I think afterschool homework club can be a splendid idea is because students can be doing very bad in some classes and just not understand what's going on, so they can get extra help afterschool from teachers or even students. In my opinion students usually understand more when teachers or students are guiding them on what to do. It's also a good idea because students can be surrounded by people who want to do well in school, and I think that can really push students to try their hardest!

Finally, I think it can be a fun idea because students will have a chance to socialize with others once they're done with their work. Students can also discuss what they've learned and maybe teach each other something new!

In conclusion, afterschool homework club would be an outstanding idea because it can help students finish their homework earlier at school, and help students with classes they aren't doing very well in. Afterschool homework club can also motivate kids to try their hardest in school!",4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,8.0,7.648763656616211,8
80F8E7B1ABBA,"Dear principal,

I think you should make students perform community service for their own good. Community service will help the student for their education also to help them get in to college. For example my sister took community service for high school and that helped her to get good grades for high school and now she's attending SCHOOL_NAME.

Therefore, community service is not a waste of time, it might be for other but for my opinion its not a waste of time, its actually a very important time for our goal and education. Cleaning up litter is very important to keep our state very clean and neat to show others we can keep everything nice and in order.

Litter is very bad for our state like we need to keep away trash from our oceans to not provide the ocean animals to get killed or sick for some trash we had to cause. Another important thing is that its good that tutors help us get good education.

In conclusion, I think students should take community service for their own good and their future in life. People may think its a waste of time but it isn't at all. I learned this from my older sister doing her community in service during school and now she is getting her currier and doing good job at her University.

So that's why I think you should require all students to perform community service.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,7.0,7.186746597290039,7
53CF6D801CAF,"I'm agree with what has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in the life. ""Generic_Name, my son, remember, you always have to have a positive mindset."" This is a quote that my grandmother kept telling me over and over again before I came to the United States. She used to tell me that negativity attracts failure. throughout my life I have always looked at the positive side. For this reason I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to success as it assists in keeping resiliency, and courage, which are essential in accomplishing goals.

We must have a positive attitude to be successful because it helps humans to be resilient. I have gone through numerous of challenges in my life including being homeless, but I always look at the good things I have, and think about those who do not have any support. A positive attitude helps people be resilient and confront everything that comes their way.

Another reason why we must be positive is because being positive brings courage. Courage allows us to not give up when we want to accomplish goals. For instance, crossing the border is dangerous, however, with courage and being positive, I have been able to cross it. Now I am about to graduate high school. I have also been successful and will be an electrician, I could not accomplish this without a positive attitude.

There are many people out there that think that being positive bring people's hope down if things don't go their way. But I do not agree. being negative brings bad wives, and bad wives brings bad things this is why I also surround myself with positive people.

To conclude , being positive is the key to success. I strongly believe this because positively brings resilient and courage. Resilient and courage are two characteristics that are important to succeed. In my life, I have been able to succeed because I have remain positive. So, I say, to everyone, think positive!",5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,10.0,8.453697204589844,8
D54821935AA6,"One topic that is frequently debated is if summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Some people think is better if it is teacher-designed. They feel that students will follow the same path. I believe that it should be student-designed because the projects will be created differently, there may be different information in each project and students will prove their capacity to do their own project.

The projects will be created differently. Students have different ideas on how to do a project. There is variety of ideas on how to do a project. Students can choose any way on how to do it, depending on what the project is about. Some students are more creative than other students. They may have different types of creativity. By doing this project students will show if they are still learning. They will show that they are learning even if they do not go to school.

Every project may have different information. Students have different ideas on projects. The projects are always different from other students. Students do not have the same brain which means they will not have the same information. Some students like to write what comes to their mind instead of getting information by searching it. Some students will have quality of information and other will have simple words.

Students will prove their capacity to do their own project. More then showing capacity to do their own project, is more to know who is responsible,organized and where they are on a specific topic. Teachers will know on who to trust for example, I would trust more on a responsible student. Students will demonstrate to the teacher how much effort they out into a project. By doing the project students may improve and have a good grade to begin with.

In conclusion,some people will still think it is better if it is teacher-designed. They feel that students will follow the same path.

7F3B3A0D56CF,"Hi elementary schools students today im going to show my lesson is that how to be a better person are in your in a bad state right now and your treating others so badly well today im going to tell you 3 ways you can be a better person but before we start i just wanna let you know that these tricks,ways. tips whenever you want to call them will not work instantly in order to work you gonna keep trying i will tell you these five words plan,rethink,try result,restart i will explain how they work and what they mean later ok now that over already lets start!

My first thing of what comes to my mind for being a better person is showing respect for others i know this is the obvious one but showing respect to others will result other people showing respect to you if your like a mean person and there that one person in your class that you dont like or get along with saying at least one nice,respectful thing could and will big difference between you and that person look i get it you dont have to be friends i know i heard about it from people and they say that you still gonna show some respect even your not friends with them and also saying nice things about that person can they feel good because you made feel good and great so that is the first that comes into my mind when it comes to be a better person and thats how step one is completed.

so for my second step is to what comes in your mind to be a better person like think about what you just say did it worked out for those who did not get it about what im talking about im talking about the result did it worked out or it did not what was coming through your mind when your saying good things so if you still dont get it this were is the four letters come in so lets start with plan.

So what comes to plan you asked well it comes to thinking in your mind in your mind your are like will this worked or will not work,also you can image the result or whats gonna happen if do that certain thing and thats pretty it for planning my next step dosent need that much explaing but i will try my best to explain alot for this next this step is called rethink by rethinking always think before you do something because you will never know it will work or not thats way always the step before do actually do the try step we will be talking about the next right here right now so for this step the same thing as rethink but this time i dont need it to explain it alot this is as know as the try step so you got your plan and you already confirm everything and now ready to try it and now you did this needs to the next step it also dosent need that much explaining the result how did it go? did it went well? did things go fresh? if did go fresh this is where the last step comes and joins the server

So for the final step dosent need that much explaining is called the try step is the final step because everyone dose not get on their first try every makes mistakes you just gonna keep trying trying trying until you finally did it and thats really it for all the four steps! B

efore we go on the last step for how to be a better person if you are feeling down or need to talk to someone about something tell someone about it or call any depression-hotline to get the help you need because you dont know what other people are going through thank you for reading this far so my final step is to just be yourself being yourself is really important because it helps you express your emotions and it helps you feel better if your that type of person is who shy and dosent wanna look people in the eyes atleast look at them in the nose it will look like your looking into their eyes and also dont try to change yourself and accept who you are because people would prefer someone who is just themselves then someone who is trying to change themselves just to fit in with other people now your thinking hows being yourself is gonna help you with coming a better person well you are just you and again people will rather go for people who are just you(themselves) than again people changing themselves just to fit in with other people trust me being yourself can you proud it dosent matter what gender,race,condition you have people will still accept you even you look different this will always one of the most important steps in becoming a better prond person!

AE0341CCEBDB,I think brining cell phone to school is great. Also using your cell phone during lunch is not a good idea because after lunch the student are not going to want to put there cell phone away. I think it better if student turn off there cell phone and keep them in there locker. One reason is because if your in class using your cell phone and your taken a test you could be cheated with the a other person in your class. Second reason is because with your cell phone you can be taken picture of other people during class. Cell phone is not bad to take to school is good to because you never know what can happen. A other thing about bringing cell phone to school is that during class while the teacher is teaching the student don't like to listen and that when the teacher get mad. I think that the policy should be you can bring your cell phone to school but if you keep it in your locker. If i was a teacher and a student is playing with there cell phone i wouldn't get mad. I will just take the cell phone away. Some student keep there cell phone in there jacket and they don't turn the volume down and during class there cell phone start ringing in class.

4B8DA6C2D322,"Should the principle force people to do extracurricular activities like sport, work on the yearbook or serve in the student council?

I do not agree with this because the student shouldn't be force to do stuff is fine if the students wants to do then but they shouldn be force to do then.

For example the principle is forcing people to do sport but there is a kid that can do sport because they have problem of walking he shouldn be force to do sport because he can do the sport because he's leg are in some condition.

The activity are helpful for students, that by doing this activities they can learn more stuff that can be helpful for the future but shouldn't be force to do then.

What if the student is force to work on the yearbook but he mes up on a yearbook of someone and that someone complains to the office, the fault of messing up the yearbook is that person who created the yearbook. and that person that mes up the yearbook is getting in trouble for messing the yearbook.

Firstly not all the peolpe have the same decisions to agree in the same thing, because some people just think in their future not in the future of the others peolpe, because in the world exist bad people and good people something the bad peolpe try to make something to the good people. The good people something get problems because they don't want to say the things that the bad people did as a ""crime"" something like that.

Secondly the person who said that statement have to gave some reasons clearly to the peolpe because like a principal person need to give good expresions and give the example to the poblation of their city, county, or state. When a principal give a good example to the people the people live in perfect union, becuase their principal gave a good reasons like our have to help each to another person, becuse the village in union never can be beaten.

Most of the students want to change school menu for a new one and better one, because many students think that the school menu is pretty bad. So should school change the menu lunch with a healthy one?

Although some say, school lunch menu is good like it already is, Actually is not bad as an idea to change it for a healthier one, most likely because, a healthier menu helps to keep our mind and body in a good and healthy state it also makes it easier for the mind to learn things better. Keepping up with good and healthy body state is always good idea specially because as young age we all are developing differently and we need to be sure of our way of eating inside and out side of home and school. Eating unhealthy school menu is something that mostly like to do a lot just many of the students usually like to eat chips instead of actual food is not good idea, but students prefer to eat that instead of the awful school lunch.

Another reason is, for students to eat healthy and have more energy to learn. It also helps out with different vitamins that help the body to have a more energy, and for the mind to be more focus on class work. Some students play sport and they need the energy to keep up with the day, so eating healty is a good option for all of those students involved in sports. Usually students that like to do a lot of sport need a lot of protain that some food that the school has don't have it and is kinda difficult for them to be strong.

After a while of taking his class, I realized that he is a very good teacher and a very nice person because every time I asked him for help, he would always tried his best to make me understand the topic and do good on my quizzes/ test. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people say that you can know someone's character by just the first impression. First impression are possible to change because they might had a bad day, and you always have to know the character before in order to judge it.

People all over the world are always going to have bad days, and that's normal because life consists on having good days and bad days; if you're having a bad day, of course you won't have a good attitude towards people. For example, some people can have problem at their house, work, school, etc... and obviously that's going to affect on their behavior and they might treat you good or bad, it depends on the situation. When you first see someone and they seems like a bad person, that doesn't mean he is a mean person; he can just be having a bad day or something bad happened. In order to judge someone you have to know the character first.

In life you can't be walking judging people just because they did something or just by their looks. For example,The majority of the population in the whole world knows the saying ""

Don't judge a book by its cover

"" this meas that just by looking at person from his outside, doesn't mean they are going to be like that on the inside. People might look either a mean person or a good person, there is some people that look like they are a good person and that they have a nice behavior, but at the end of the story they might do you wrong and you are going to be the one losing by trusting the person by just thinking they had "" a good personality""; However, there is also the people that looks like a ""bad person"" but some of those people can be nice from the inside, and you might need help from them at one point.

In conclusion, first impression are possible to change because people might be just having a bad day, and also because after you get to know the character as they originally are, then you are going to start thinking differently about that person. It's important for you to know the character first before you start judging that person, because you never know if that one person that you rejected/judge at the beginning, can be the person that you need the most in the future.

901DD3AC6032,"Here's a question to you all, do you think that working in a group is better then working alone, if you wonder which I prefer it's simple, I say that working alone in modern age is better than a group.

Now I'm going to put out three claims I have working alone; with friends, modern students, and a big distraction.

The first is friends. If you have friends (which I believe everyone does.) then you will always notice that you want to be with your friends and not with random students you don't know about and have a weird relationship (as close friend not a different level.) and hate each other, but of course friends talk about whatever they talk about also having more than one friend means it's going a big loud party getting distracted and that's how students don't get their work done.

Second modern students, this is for teachers mostly, teacher's know how students today are like; there noisy, not mature, always fighting both yelling and physically, as well as boys pants or jeans are sagging, and girls having tight clothes to show skin. Now the two I mention are noisy and fighting, modern students get offended easily which results in fighting physically, before they start fighting they always talk a lot and its nothing to do with work and make a lot of noises distract others from working.

And third but no least a big distraction. Yet again students working so hard but are distracted by so many noises to be dragged along in it, friends are and will always be similar to siblings, ""how?"" you many ask all great teacher, well siblings do one that I mentioned in this paragraph ""a big whopping distraction"" if your female teacher and have kids than you what i'm talking about however males don't have all problems females have but think one thing that you so hard and fail or forgot whatever you were doing all because of your kids or siblings took that away from you and thats how students are like and I really don't have explain anything about students since their modern and child like.

I will say in a group seems like good idea, you know the more brains the more solutions to have, although it's a good idea at less in the past or better minds but this is the modern ages were people always on their cell phones, always fighting, and barely talking about their future, but being alone is better since you won't a distraction around, confident in your work with out people judging, and you won't be crowded.

And now for my conclusion. If you know what I have been talking about this entire time then you know being alone for is better since they can just improve on their own and not always rely on others, you get it know, it's your choice to choose which one, alone or a group I just hope you know your doing teach.",3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,7.0,5.778648376464844,6
C9CBCB6050B2,"I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure, because from every failure we can learn to improve ours failures. For example when you are playing soccer with your team and maybe do you have many times without win but, you do not stop to play good or better that the last time and can win.

I believe that the human need to believe on himself and know that this life can be rude sometimes, but we can learn and learn of every fall that's why we are not perfect.

6.00E+11,"Should your school follow this model by extending the school day hours?

There are some people would love to have a two hour extended school day and theres some that don't want two hour extended school day. Therefore, schools shouldn't extend two more hours. There some students that have jobs or have to take care of there siblings. The schools can add an two more hours for the people that need it for extra help or for the ones that want to graduate early.

Schools should not be extending it by two hours. The students will make an issue if they have two hour extended and they make end up being late for school. What the schools should do is to get the people that wants to have a two hour extended time for school for any type of reason and give it to them or give it to the students that are struggling in a class and extra help. It will make a big change if the schools do it like that even for the students that want to graduate early. The students will not really stressed about it but the idea is to make it easy for the students. however, the schools can go different ways with this extents.

The disadvantage is how the school schedule is changing maybe less sleep for the students or more sleep for the students. Since the school are extending two more hours they can leave the schedule how it or change it.

The problem with that the students will get more confused on there school schedule and the time that they have to leave to there next class. The four day week for school might work for studnets but they will miss a lot of learning and all that important stuff also they can relax and not be over stress about school. The four day week of school sounds about right but adding two more hours into school is going to be a little issue however, the studnets have too do a lot of work in school.

C68590C2792E,"Policy 2 is my favorite because of the following .

I have to agree with policy 2 in some ways. students will be tempted to go over time and miss a class, they might be using the phone for something that is not right and they could get in big trouble, the kids will also be tempted to use in class after using in free time if they had a good talking to their friends and playing games and stuff.

A reason why i don't agree with policy 2 is because if something happens during school and its an emergency and they need to contact a family member they would not have anything to contact them with and even if the school had a phone i would disagree because what if one of the students got caught inside building and no one noticed that someone was missing, the kid that was caught inside the building needs to contact someone so they know were that person is.

Another reason why kids should not have phones in school is because they could be getting answers from the cell phones internet, witch could helped them cheat on a test and that would not improve him at all when he goes to high school or college, if he want to get in a good college you have to get good grade.

The students in their free time might also use the cell phone to contact other friends from another school and get that kid in trouble and that would not be good for that student.

I think that students should have their phones in their locker or where they keep their stuff but if there is an emergency they should be allowed to go get in and contact someone where they are safe or they can get a box where the students put the phones and its by the door so when there is an emergency they can walk out the door with their phones but if they had their phones they would have to be on silent or vibration so they don't distract the class and students that really care about their future.

There is many different options but i think that policy 2 would be the best thing to do for the students and how we use are phones so much It would be hard for us not to use are phones if we had it with us. policy 2 would help the most if there is not an emergency and to keep kids getting good grades and paying attention in class and hurting those who care about their grades and make into the school or job they want. policy 2 is the best fit for cell phones in school.",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,6.0,6.692939281463623,7

Following this model by extending the school day two hours can be method to conserve energy and resources.

First, conserve energy and resources through extend the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need those resources in the community. For example, in the community close to the school live some families with not much resources. They do not have money for pay the energy or buy needs as water or food. The only way that they can have resources as energy is through a big building as a school in the community. In other words, if the school follow this model by extending the school day two hours can conserve energy and resources and give to the community as a needs.

26788FA4ED04,"All schools from United State have a longer summer vacations and that make the students happy but there are some educators feel that summer break is too long and that students don't retain information as easily when they return to school. Summer vacations should don't be change because students want to go to others countries, spend time with their friends and family, and they don't want to be worry about school.

When the students are in summer vacations they planning to go and visit others countries. They want to go to visit their family that live in other country or they only want to go and meet new places. If the educators change the summer vacations to only 3-4 weeks the students will not have much time to visit the places that they want to go. Nevertheless, not all the students want to go to others contries and stay a long time, there some prefer stay in home but they spend the summer time doing what they like to do.

The students like to spend time doing things that they like to do in summer vacations; for example, they want to spend sometime with their family and friends and make memories together. Also they want to work to make money, play video games, play some sports, or go to a summer camp. Meanwhile, others students don't want to go outside because it's so hot or they don't like be under the sun but they also don't want to go to school.

Students like summer vacations because they can make a lots of things that they can't do when they are in school. For example, if they want to go to a party or to a friend's house and can back to their houses until the morning or if they want to look TV all the day they can do it. In addition, they are happy to have a long summer vacation because they are not worry about homewoork or projects, they don't have to get up early to go to school, or study for a test. A long summer break can affect the memory of the students and they can forget somethings that they learn in school; however, some students like to review their notes and it's not so long the summer break. Furthmore, the students don't forget everything that they had learn and take a break of something so difficult and important like school is good.

In conclusion, a long summer break is something good that help the students to relax and come back the next school year with a big smile and ready to learn new things. The students like more a long than a short summer break because they can do more things that they like. The students like summer more than winter because in winter is cold and there not many things to do. Instead, in summer is hot and there are so much things to do. Therefore, the summer vacations should stay the same and don't be change.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,7.0,6.368253707885742,6
AE9542EB602D,"Do kids really have to stay after school for their homework and difficulties with school work? Studies have shown that one way to improve students achievement is to stay after school with teachers for help. In my opinion, students should stay after school for help from the teachers. Students get to know the teachers more, students can also learn better and understand more. Students can get preparation for their upcoming test.

First of all, students can get extra help from the teachers. If there are students, who cannot focus in their class time, they can focus on their work alone after school with the teachers,with no disturbance. Teachers can also get their school work done. For example, grading papers, putting grades in the computer or mailing people, they need to. Students who are weak in school, can be really good students too, but they don't try. Just by staying after school for a few weeks can make them a brilliant student.

In Addition, students who don't know their teachers, can get to know them. There is always a student in every class, who is always quiet and barely talks, but has a bad grade. They never finish their work on time, turn in work on time and get bad grades in their assessment. They can talk to the teacher alone or the teacher can talk to them about their grades and tell them how they can improve. Teachers are someone who help you make your future, but you have to put your hard work in it too, so you can have a good future.

Finally, students can also stay after school for an upcoming test or the final exam of the year. For example, if you failed in the fifth grade math exam, but in sixth grade you stayed after school with your teacher every week, on tuesday's and thursday's, and passed your math exam, then every year you should stay after with your teacher, so you can improve on you exams score, every year. If you pass extended math, don't stop studying at home. Teachers are always there to help students with their tests.

In conclusion, I think we should have after school homework club, so students can get help for their homework or their test, get to know kids with difficulty's in their class. To sum up, give extra practice to students who are struggling. Some students who plan to go to homework club will feel embarrassed, because they have bad grades. That club can help students and make them a better student. Are students going to pass their assessments and classes by taking this club?",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,8.0,7.514902591705322,8
CA8DAD4BCC7A,"Should students graduate earlier from high school? Graduation earlier have been the choice that a lot of students on make on their lives. They may feel over-confident when they are clear about what are their accomplishments and the things that they have to do to reach it. It is not that easy as it sounds because they need to prepared themselves and notify that it will be difficult to reach their goals. However at the end they will see that was for a good and valuable things for their lives. They might will need to work hard and feel like to exceed themselves. It is good idea to graduate earlier because students will have the opportunity to find a job after they graduate and earn money then later they can start going college, they will be more productive in society, and they will develop their skills and knowledge.

Students that graduate earlier need to have enthusiasm and know that they will have a more difficult life and realize that they will have more responsibilities and duties in society, when they are out of school they should take that as an advantage to use their time wisely and help themselves by trying to find a job and earn some money; if they are taking the decision to go to college in few years. It is hard to find a job when the time pass and they did not practice all the things that they learn in the past and then realize that they should do sometime productive same as when they were in high school before they graduate.

In addition they will be helping their parents same as they did it when they were in school, by supporting and care about of them, they will be contributing in home and society. Also, they will have others accomplishments that they might want to reach it and celebrate with their families and make them feel proud and happy of their goals. Understanding that all the things that they did are for have good benefits and others people will used as good thing to defend or help themselves.

Finally, all students have the same capacity to show up and do the right things, after they graduate they have the opportunity to find a job and demonstrate how the develop their skills and knowledge. Staying positive and knowing that they can do great and specials things will make them feel proud of their works and then they will prove that they can do amazing things like everybody does. Providing high qualities of themselves in a workplace can help them to know and find new information about what things are happening in the world that round them.

Students should be thinking what they want do in their future or after high school since when they are growing up because that will help them to clear their minds and thoughts. Working hard and doing it with enthusiasm that is how they will be success in their future. Earning money by working honestly later that will be a big step to start a career in college, helping people and communities will make them feel more productive and helping their attitudes to stay confident, brave, and strong all the time with themselves,demonstrating their abilities and capacities is how they will be success in their futures lives.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,6.0,6.549771785736084,7
108C2B892E48,I believe having a four day school week would be great and also the students would have a three day weekend. But adding two more hours to a school day wouldn't be great because nobody would like to stay in school for two more hours everybody would disagree with the idea on adding more hours in a school day. If a business has adopted the idea on adding two more hours on their work days doesn't mean that the schools has to adopt the same idea because some times ideas may go well with something but may not go well with something else. And if a school adopts the idea what resources are they going to be conserving they are going to use more energy because they are adding two more hours in school. And plus they are going to be using more paper to make paper work for the students because by adding more time in school class is extended and that means that teachers got to print out more paper work for the students. And also if a school is planing to conserve energy and resources by only having four days in a week that doesn't mean that other schools are going to do the same too. So thats my beliefs on the idea of have a four day school week and adding to more two more hours to a school day.,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,5.0,5.953050136566162,6
33B5A70B7B4B,"Some people believe that ""true self-esteem"" comes from praise, but some others think it comes from achievement. But i believe that ""true self-esteem"" comes from achievements, and in this essay I will tell you why and how true self-esteem comes from the achievements you make that you might take pride in. When somene achieves something that it doesn't really happen to too much in the world, they feel confident in themselves and they know that they did something that not everyone can do so they get self-esteem and they feel like they are suprior then other normal people. True self-esteem is not something you are born with, and a lot of people believe that. But also a lot of people take the other side and say that True self-esteem comes from achievements and comes from wining. And that's the side that i take in and I'll give you reasons why.

For my first example I'm going to continue what the introduction was mostly about. In other words, why I think that True self-esteem actually comes from achievements. Like I said, i believe that achieveing somethig that not everyone reaches or not everyone can do, can actually boost your confidents by a lot or it can even boost your ego. For example. If two people are trying to reach the top of the tallest mountin in the world, and both of them are going at it and they are having this big compition. Then all of the sudden one of them gave up at the middle and went all the way down again. Of course he will feel like a fool and that he couldn't stand up for his ego, and of course his self-esteem will go down by a lot, because after all of that he got beat. But imagine the guy that didn't give up and actually completed his goal, of course his ego and his self-esteem would go up by a lot. Also he will walk around feeling really confindent, becasue he achieved something not everyone finishes and most just give in doing it. Walking around talking about his achievement that he is really proud of, are going to be the words that are going to come out his mouth all day. Becasue achievements are the key to the perfect life style.

Another reason I say that is becuase I also believe that students don't have to be self confident to learn. I believe that learning comes from what the students wants and what they are intersted in. Basically what I'm trying to say is that students can be the least confident they can be, but if they are intersted in the subject of what they are learning, i believe that they will learn faster and more. Teaching students materials that are not intersting or if the teacher makes it boring. In that situation the students will not learn and would just get distracted by something else. Because that's what teenagers want, they want someone who isn't tired all the time and someone who has the energy to tell them what to do. Other wise, they won't listen to you.

That also ties on with the side i choose, which was ""Why i believe that people get true self-esteem by achievements."" You might ask how does that tie in with your side? I'll say this, if the teacher is teaching a classroom something boring, and no one pays attention. When the test comes are they going to fail or pass? Of course they are going to fail, and what happens after that? Their grades are going to go down -> they going to get sad -> they start feeling dumb -> they get less confident -> their ""true self-esteem"" is gone right? But lets talk about the teacher that makes a subject fun and enjoyable to hear: If the teacher makes the material enjoyable, and intersting of course the whole class is going to pay attention. When the test comes who's going to pass? mostly of the class that listened and payed attention. Now let's see what will happen? Their grade is going to go up -> they get happy -> they start paying more attention -> they pass more test -> they achieve more -> NOW their true self-esteem comes back and stronger than ever.

There's some people who believe that ""true self-esteem"" comes from praise, but some others think it comes from achievements. But i believe that ""true self-esteem"" comes from achievements, and in this essay told you why and how true self-esteem comes from the achievements you make that you might take pride in. Some examples I gave you was about how not giving up and letting other people give up boosts your self-esteem. Other examples were about students learning about something they are motivated to hear other than something they could care less about. By telling you my reasons i hope you understood them and understood my side point of view and why i think that. I hope you enjoyed reading my essay, i tried my best on and here's another quike example. If i pass this SOL i will be happy and of course that will boost my ""true self-esteem"" because passing it is the achievement I'm trying t achieve.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,7.0,6.755115509033203,7
62E5030D1A59,"Imagine getting a job that you're most interested and enjoys the most that later on life, you became super rich or making decent money but doesn't mind as long as you enjoy it and still continuing on. Life can be hard if people don't enjoys their jobs, causing them to have depression. That is why, students should select to visit and learn about the work that interests them because, it gives them more time to think, making plans for their future, and to gain experience through out the school years.

Students should be planning for their future and to decide which class to take in order for them to learn about the work that interests them. Many students have successfully acquired the jobs they intended to work because of how much work they put into to plan and learning the stuff they need to know on how to run the job. Planning is really important for all of our lives. For example, the military uses a plan and tactics in order for them to calculate and for the plan to be successful. Because of that, planning has a big impact in our lives and helps us to decide on what jobs to do and to give us the time to think. This way we can understand the situation and whether or not if the people and their families to decide if it's a good idea.

Students can gain little experience by taking the class every each year, this way students can learn more about the Jobs they want to be in. For example, JROTC are similar to military but trained to be a marching men and to juggle with rifle (from what I know of). They exist because, it helps students to understand what its like for them to experience JROTC. I also think this is very important. It's like, warming up for a swimming contest but, how can you win if you don't know how to swim? Swimming class exist to help people to not drown. If you take swimming class every year, and gain a little bit of experience, you will be able to win the swimming contest. All this reason is to proof of why gaining experience is a good thing and help you understand the job you wanted to applied for.

Giving students the time to think on what jobs their most interested on is also very important for this prompt. For example, students need time to think whether or not if it's the right class for them. Every year in high school students are required to pick three choice to pick their class. It is called the Course Election, where students gets to pick three class that are interesting for them or forced to pick because it is a requirement. I really like this idea, it helps us understand what we're interested on and what to learn. I think three years is enough for students to plan and to have a little experience for their future.

In conclusion, student are more successful if they are to be picked for themselves instead of the school choosing for them, because the more they like the class and the job they are going for, the harder they will try to succeed.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,8.0,7.200087547302246,7
5CA2DCC616C6,"Energy had become the most usable thing in the world; without energy students couldn't be able to find information for their homework or projects. In this life time is the most valuable thing students can lose. Although students would have a three-day weekend, they would not lose any minute of class, nevertheless they would have more time to work because they would go to school only four days per week, which would give them more time to earn more money at work, spend more time with family and friends, and do their homework and projects on those three-day weekend.

To begin, energy is the most usable thing everyone use, and if students do not start to conserve it, in the future it could be difficult to get. For example, technology in schools is advancing over the years. Teachers give homework and projects to students online where they have to use their smart phones, which need energy to get charge, so they can use them for their assignments. They also use internet, which requires energy to function. This proves that if Generic_School extend the school day two hours for a four-day school week to conserve energy and resources, teachers would have to start giving students homework in which they have to use books. Obviously, students would have to adapt to find information for their homework and projects in books, like old times, and stop using technology to find information.

Furthermore, students would like the idea of having a three-day weekend. For example, they could use that time for work, spend time with family and friends, and do homework and projects. This shows that students would not miss any day of school because they would spend the same amount of hours they usually spend at school, but only in four days; the two extra hours Generic_School would extend on the schedule for a four-day week, would sum the hours the students spend on a regular week, yet they will divide that time in four days. They also can earn more money if they work more hours on those days that they would have off. Students would also have more time to study for any test they may have, or do any homework or projects. Clearly, this will be a benefit for students and teachers. They would get an extra day off without missing anything at school.

Overall, students would enjoy their three-day weekend studying, working, or spending time with family and friends because they would have an extra day on the weekend. Students would also adapt to find information in books.

Some student are really lazy maybe because they sleep late at night and they go to school tired and without energy. The student can be complained for everything they can get mad or be talking bad stuff to the teacher. Some of them are not really respectful they are rude and they might do what they want. Student might disagree with the idea and they can started putting bad stuff at social media or sending email to the teacher. Because maybe they will go tired home and they might have plans to do after school. Not all the student might like this idea.

need to spend time with family, some student love to play sport after school but if they add one more hour they wont anymore because they will be tired. lets say that the student plays soccer at 2:50 and if add one more hour they won even have time to do there homework. you wont hangout with friends anymore. Maybe because they cant hangout that late because they have to get home early. helping your mom shopping to buy food and she need might need your help.

8B2CB9C1F189,"Ever think of just staying home one day and not deal with school for once, well you can. Some school offer learning distance to attend classes from home, by online or a video conferencing. This is a good thing to students if they have health problems, can get a better sleeping schedule, and students will feel safer at home then school. But some people will say that staying home will make them lazier and not do the work, but that's not the case here. We want the students to focus on their goal and if this is the way then let it be.

There are a lot of kids that have health problem that need to be check every couple of hours or need to take pills every couple of hours a day, if not check they could be in trouble and send to the hostile. At home the parents can help them to remember to take there pills or do their daily check up at home or to the doctor office. Appointments is another problem that we all face and hate. There are times when you can't get the time you want, so you will not miss any school hours, that doesn't work all the time. But when you are taking online classes you don't need to worry about that, you can just take the class later that day or take your computer to the appointment since they take forever to finish and work on it there.

Sleep is very important to health, because it will make you feel ready to do stuff and help you focus on your work better. When you tell your kids to go to bed or your kids are old enough to go to bed all by them self, half the time they don't go to sleep right away. They might be on their phone all night or they have a sleeping problem that takes time to fall asleep. When this happens they don't want to get up in the morning, late or miss to the school bus and fall asleep in class. Taking online classes from home will let you pick the time you want to do the classes, so that you will have energy to finish them easier and not past out ever second of the day.

What is the most important thing in the world, yourself, your life, your kids, or family? It can be anything, but when you are a mother or father your kids safely is more important then your own. School should be a fun time, learning cool stuff you didn't even know about and a safe place to feel comfortable of being yourself, not being scared to go to school because another kid is bullying you, or a teacher is sexual to you. Parents will do anything to protect their kids. So when your kid is not feeling safe in school, the best thing the parent or kid will think about is take online school, if the problem at school is too much to deal with. They will feel more clam, comfortable and safer taking the online classes at home.

Therefore, those are the reasons why online classes are benefit for people that are too sick to go to school, a better sleeping schedule and most importantly being safe.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,8.0,7.183375835418701,7
374CF6E834A5,"Year-round schools have more break over the year, you may have more break during the year but you will have less vacation time over the summer, it's going to shows that year-round schools has more stress, less vacation time and less money make over the summer.

The first issue about year-round schools is more stress, the main thing students stress about is what clothes should they wear to school everyday it makes students to buy more clothes even when they have a lot of clothes because some students want to look better than everyone else in school by not wearing the same clothes everyday to school. students are not the only people who stress teachers will stress about what lesson should they teach and they will a lot assignment to grade.

The second issue about year-round schools is less vacation time, students will have 3 to 4 week vacation over the summer so student won't have as much vacation time as they would like to have because 3 to 4 week vacation is not a lot of time for student to go to another country for long time. parents will be affected by this too because some responsible parents can't leave their kids and go to another country alone.

The third issue about year-round schools is less money make, student can't work over the summer because they don't have the time, one month is not a long period of time to work you can still make some money but you can's make as much money as you could make in 3 months not only the students would make less money government will too they would buy for the electricity and water and other stuff.

Some may say you will have more breaks over the year, but you will not have as much vacation time over the summer.

Some other may say you will not forget anything you learned if you have short break time, but learning everyday without any long breaks will make you a lot of stress.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,8.0,6.020929336547852,6
73A997703BC3,"Does technolgy have a posistive or negative effect in your life? To me it does because it allows me to complete many things without having contact with others. For example when you wanna order something online you dont have to calll you can just order it online with out contaction anyone.

Technology can help you in manys ways. One way it can help you is by if you dont know the answers to a homework you can go on a computer or even a phone and look up answers and wedsites of where your answers can be. Another way is if you need to do technology work need to be done at home you can use a computer and send an email to your teacher without contacting her about it when your done. To me i see this as a positive effect on people because it can help you succed in school and complete things you need to do as well.

There are so many other ways technology can help you as well. when you wanna sign up for soccer you can regrister online. All you have to do is answers qustions put your information and once your done putting your information in you can pay for it and once you pay your coach will get an email that you singed up for his team. Technology for kids is positive when they are younger than 5. Letting them use phones and tablets would be good so they can learn how to say , words , letters, numberrs, and learn new things before they go to school and already know a couple things. So that to me is a posetive effect with technology

For sum people negative effects could also be negative for them also. When a parent dosent know how to use a phone it can be stressfull for them becuase they wouldnt know what to do unless someone is there to help him and do the things the parent needs to do on the one. Also another negative effect is when if you have all work saved in a computer and you get your computer wet and it wont turn on how are you gonna show your boss or teacher your so that would have a big negative effect on the worker. These are sum ways technology can have a negative effect on you.

To me technology has a poseitive effect in my life because I can be able to do more things and not have to worry about and contact people to help me do it. I also beleive for other people it can help aso for like, work, bank, food and more . But sometimes they can also be negative things but negative things also happen in life so its okay for that to happen.

F4F054797227,"I believe that people yes should make their own decisions and follow their instincts because that is what make us different from others. Follow your intincts and what you think that it is right can make a big change in what you are and what you want to be.

First. People need to believe in themselves and do what they think that it is right. Sometime we are afraid to make ours onw decision because we think that is wrong or because what others can think about us. But just think about, all the things that people had been invented along the time. What would will happend if they did not make their onw decisions, nothing that what we have today will not exist. So do not be afraid to make your onw decisions because others. Is not bad to look what other had been done and see if what you are about to do can be good or not. But always follow your ideas and do your onw work.

The instincts is a natural aptitude that human have, is something that make us do things without a well reason. The instincts make us do things that we think are right because a felling that we felt. No matter, sometime that felling can be rigth or not. But sometime bad decisions teach us what we do wrong and learned how do it better in a future. people should follow their instincts and ideas because that is what make us defferent. Learn of what we do wrong make us a better person. Poeple always are going to judge you and talk about your decisions no matter if are good or bad. So do not let others stop you and doing the things that you believe are right.

The decisions that we make today can harm us in the future. That may be is right, but if we always are thinking about what is going to happend. we never are going to know what is really going to happend. So make own ours decisions can make a big change ir our life for good or bad. It is important to listen to experts because can be helpful in what you are abuot to do. But always do it because you want to do it, not because other tell you. Always do may make you happy, no metter if you are wrong or not because that is what is going to make the difference.

In conclision yes people should follows their instincts and ideas. But also make their own decisions. Never stop doing that things that they like. Always do and follows what they believe and think carfully and what they want and where they want to be. The goods and bads decisiones and experiences and learn of they if what really teach you about life's important matter and make you succeed.

F0078F48B6D1,"Im Generic_Name and my special skill/talent is that I am a competitor. I like to compete when it comes to certain things, because It motivates me to practice and work for what i want to achieve. I got my competitive spirit from my older brother. But I usually get competitive when it comes to video games or sports. But I also like to compete because I like to win.

How did my brother make me competitive? He would always say that I would lose and it would change my whole perspective of things. He would always win, so it would motivate me to practice. Me watching him practice would also make me competitive cause him practicing would motivate me to practice to try to be the best. He would also like to say that ""you're gonna lose"" and it would change my whole mood.

How does being competitive motivate me? It motivates me to practice, because it makes me want to be the best I want to be. It also motivates me more if I lose, because it makes me want to do the same thing again until i win at it. Watching my favorite sports motivate me cause it makes me want to be in those big leagues someday. My goal is to be a pro basketball player and I cant get there if i'm not competitive.

Being competitive can get you a future in anything and you should work on this skill. It will teach you life lessons, it will make you be successful, and it will teach you to work hard for what you want. You should have a goal set in mind and just go work hard and achieve that goal.

CEFC32741811,"People who have self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. I think that getting guidance from experts could help make decisions better because most people look and ask for guidance on a lot of things most of them are on decisions to make whether it's a good or bad decision to make.

I have asked people for guidance on decisions i remember i asked my old teacher if i should move to the U.S or stay in my country Generic_City. He told me that it would be better to move to the U.S because i would have more chances of being successful over there than staying in Generic_City and that i would have a better life too and that was one of the hardest decisions i have ever made in my life because i was leaving friends and family behind and i didn't want that to happen.

I have been asked for help before, my friend one day she called me and asked me to help her on her relationship i could tell that she needed help and guidance i could her it in her voice they got into this argument and she told me that it wasn't the first time they have argued before and she told me that it got to this one point that it made her cry so i told her that she needs to break up with him and that he wasn't good for her and if she keeps dating him the argument's could get worse what if he starts getting violent with her and stuff. I told her that it's going to be hard but it's for the best.

People ask for help when they need it or when they want it , However some people may not agree with me because they value their self-reliance and trust their instincts, they think that they should keep their personal problems to themselves but eventually those people are going to start having this feeling like they should talk about it to somebody and ask for their guidance because the same thing happened to me i didn't like telling people what was going on with my life later on i started feeling like i needed to talk to somebody about my decisions and i started to ask my family and friends for guidance.

1E38AA12D0FA,"In the World, we have a lot of energy and resources like : tree, water, sunlight,... Everyday, we almost to use energy and resources spend for each individual. It's really necessary for everybody right ? But someone will not even know which one is benefits and which one is disadvantages. It's will be the big problem appears if we use to the wrong way. Now, I will talking a little about energy and resources.

Almost energy and resources is important. Because it's help for house and car,... Specially they can be created a lot of work and help some people lost the job, and it's might be easy to help the life better. When the energy improve than we can change to energy natural like : sunlight, wind, ... It's energy never gone. We can take that and applies for industry. It can save a lot money for every body right ? People Japanese could be applies energy natural to created the train. That's train can go faster and now is top one in the world about train faster. Almost some businesses have work four-day with ten hours. it's good, because ten hours for a day is enough. If we spend time too much about resources than someday, it's will be gone.

If we used resources too much. Someday, it will be gone. Like we take tree change for paper or desk, when the tree not anymore. The storm is coming, what else can be safe people pass to storm. If some state used too much energy for they job than some state can lost the energy because the energy not share enough. The same thing people Chinese growth up too fast, they need resources to do house and anything necessary for them. When resources is gone, the can not created any house. So some people need to move another country can survive.

You must take the class during the summer to improve your grade and go to forward. However, it will not be easy to get your diploma from high school there is a lot to do. The traditional course for the students is it helps them a lot that is making since for the student who are able to taking a three years course. Some students are interested to graduating early because they can have one more year extra to do stuff, not spending time and undue stress.

Graduating from high school is the first step being an adult. Many students are the don't have parent to live with them they have take of them self sometimes life is makes you persuade yourself to change your life. After they graduate from high school they can spend there time with applying collage,scholarship. I believe the student they can afford this programs because student need to strive there education to graduate early. They start need to think about collage then what they need to have done.

Many students they go to three years high school they skip one years after they graduate they will have a job for there collage they can make there school payment by there own. If the students are taking three years programs i believe they will take there class serious. One of the main benefit of having your high school diploma is that you will be able to get better job opportunity. Being happy with what you did to graduate and you became a success. if you are taking your time you will have one day your diploma going to be very recompense to you.

A179E4E34D35,"Students and teacher have opposing views on working together for various. However, when people are treated as partners working together, their motivation increases. Along with more motivation,students are able to communicate with each other; therefore, creating a better final product. Working in a team also prepares students for future careers and jobs where they will be requited to learn to cope with other people and personalities. It is an important skill to be able to get along with others and it is valued by employers. Even though students may not agree with each other all the time, working together is more beneficial than working alone.

Everybody has heard someone in their life say ""Two minds are better than one"" before,tight? This quote has never rang more true, and all of the ideas it promotes reflect crystal clear off of group work. Working in a group can drastically reduce the amount of work you meed to do as well as make things a lot more efficient, whether it be a group project, paper, or presentation. Because it cuts down on how much work one person has to do, it allows for the group to achieve more as a whole. Things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group, and people with different skill sets can do what they are best at and do not have to worry about what they are bad at. The diversity found within a group of people is one of the most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task. It leads a group of people to have many more ideas to come up with and bounce off of because many people are working.

""The best way to have good ideas is to have lots of them"" a quote from Linus Pauling dealing with the dilemma new idea's. When dealing with fabricationg an idea from thin air, it be best to have multiple people instead of one, because it brings multipe ideas tthat all have a fair and different point rather than multiple ideas with no opposition or dicersity. Another benefit of having multiple people working in one group is this can cayse an evloutonary like phenomenon with multiple. stronger ideas that compete and mutate creating one, intricate and exceptional idea. This also comes with the help of a group, as a group can decide which idea would be better off for the howle project, and the group can also take the main idea and smoothe out the edges. Another problem that can come up is, well pmblems. Hacing a group of people can become extremely helpful for solving a problem that may come up. In situations where a problem can arise, having a group od people can allow for a quick and easy way to get out of a situation. Now working in a group does have its advantages, but some things are best done alone.

Though working in a group can seem to he good, working alone can be better, depending on the situation. Being in a froup full of dull and unfocused froup members is infuriating and may seem like torture. Although, some people prefer working alone because they can focus better and make decusuins faster. However, in the end, it is better to work in a group. if one doce not do work, then onley they fail. Also, being in a group feels safer, while being alone mcans you are much more impolent, so working in a group.

Though working alone can be better for one's own reasons, such as anxiety, paranoia, worry about others preferences, or simply because they would prefer to work alone, working in a team is an advantage over some others who are unaccuslomed to doing so, It helps develop people skills, decision making skills, and a general expertise for have a fair and different point rather than multiole ideas with no opposition or diversity. Another benefit of having multiple people working in one group is that this can cause an evolutionary like phenomenon with multiple, stronger ideas that comes with the help of a group, as a group can decide which idea would be better off for the whole progect, and the group can also take the main idea and smoothe out the edges. Another problem that can come up is, well problems. Having a group of people can become extremely helpful for solving a problem that may come up. In situations where a problem can arise, having a group of people can allow for a quick and easy way to get out of a situation. Now working in a group does have its advantages, but some things are best done alone.

Overall, working tofether is beneficial becausc it creates less work and allows more work to be completed faster. Working together promots constrictoive criticism from other members of the froup, which produces a hetter final product. Working together creates different points of view. With different points of view, new ideas are generated. New ideas create diversity and diversity is the key to success.

Reflection:

As a group, we decided that working as a team is more beneficial than working alone. We all afreed that is important for future jobs. Working alone does have its benfits, but does not help us learn how to worl and communicate with other team members.                 ",3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,7.0,8.683379173278809,9
D537BE6997F7,"I agree with success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because everyone need to be stronger, successful, and become independent youself.

Success are things that everybody need to be stronger the most they can with every single thing in your life because everyone has bad moments in lifes and there are many peoples that they want to see them fail in everything. For example, if someone is given in they can find someone who is bad person and the only thing that they do is to given words that did not help in anything, but that's why they have to failure, but do not have to loss enthusiasm because if you loss enthusiasm you are failed in everything because in lifes you can find peoples that want to help you a lot, but sometimes you are going to find good peoples that want to help you in everything. Therefore, it does not matter what other peoples want to tell you people just have to continue their lifes and do not have to give up in anything, it does not matter peoples have to do everything they can because if you propose what you want you can do it no one is going to said no.

Success is that everyone has to be successful in lifes because everybody has to be esthusiasm in everything. You do not have to loss that because you have to be with good smile because it does not matter what is happened in your life you must have to had a good smile in everything because it does not matter how many times in your lifes you are falling you have to continue because if you do not do a good job, thinking that you can not do what you want, or said that you are going give up in everything. For example, if your sister said that some people said that she can not make her dream true you can talk with her with enthusiasm and said that she can do everything she can propose because she do not have to listen those peoples that can not want their lifes good they failature is her past that means that others peoples are going to do the same thing because in this lifes exist peoples that want the bad thing to you that ever can exist.

Success something in life is more harder than you think because you have to pass a lot of thing in your life and you have to stay strong the more you can because if one day you are going to fail in something and there is no one to give you support and you can not anymore, but you have to said in your mind that it does not matter because you are thinking in your mind that you are never give up with anything because you have your mind with power, esthusiasm, and stronger. However, you do not have to be thinking bad things there are some times that you failure with many things that can be in the school, work, or test. You always have to be in mind that it does not matter how many times you took your test and get bad grades you have to do it until you get good grade or how many days you are going to take to learn any kind of food the thing is the you have to be a good person to show to other peoples that you can do whatever you want to show to the world that you can do everything you want because they are here to fail, but if you lose a lot of time you are going to wake up twice.

Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because in this world everyone is here to be something in their life to be someone stronger to make your skills stronger to show to the peoples that you want to be someone with energy to show that there are so many things that you want to do be a successful person to help peoples when they need something; it does not matter what you are passing or what your life is give you. You just have to learn how to be a good person, how you can make your skills stronger, and how you can demostrated to yourself what you can do and can not do because that is a harder to know yourself to see what you can do or not because you can see more peoples that if they can not do anything they do not tried anymore they are sad, mad, or angry with their self because they can not do what they wanted. For example, if your friend want to be in the future a teacher and he/she has to learn, to be prepared, and study. He may not want all of that or he/she may have travel with all of those things he/she is going to get mad with herself, sad with herself, angry with herself and he/she is going to said no i can not with all of this is so harder that i think, but everyone has to be stronger show that you do not have to get mad to show with enthusiasm that does not matter how many times you may fail you have to learn, study, be prepared everything you need and you will see that you can everything you want.

In conclusion, Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because you have to be stronger, successful, and become independent yourself because you have to be stronger with any problem in your life, stronger with every person, and stronger with whatever you have to do. You have to be successful with yourself, with your work, and with your own things. You have to be independent with yourself because when you are older or you are lonely you have to see for your owns things, you have to fight for you owns problems, and for your owns bussiness. For example, if you are going to be a good police you have to see what is coming what your enthusiasm is going to be what you have to be. You have to fail many things, but you have to tried the most you can because is this life everything you do have to be with enthusiasm. Therefore, If you find a job and you boss said that you have to go to do a fish and you went, but you did it wrong and he said this is wrong you failure you have to tried again you have to go with enthusiasm not be angry or sad because you are going to do that with enthusiasm to said im going to do this rigth not wrong because everything you do with enthusiasm everything you will get more better and you will be happy because if you do everything good you are going to feel thatyou do a esthusiasm and good work.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,6.0,5.361245632171631,5

Failing at something always gives somebody a push , makes them work harder for what they want I know from experience. I see it as a motivation for someone.

A lot give up afterwards , when I fail at something It only makes me want to keep going to accomplish my goal . Although It must be frustating I see no reason to stop trying , good things always come when you're patient .

Many famous people have made it with so many mistakes. Many artist got denied , they got brought down and many didn't believe in them but after all of that they've been very successful in life . Sometimes you just have to go keep going no matter how many times you fail , they'll be good outcomes .

When I say I know from experience It's because I've been there a lot of times. There's been so many times where I just wanted to stop trying but my goal always made me get motivated . I've failed many test , for a second I thought I wasn't graduating but here I am three months away from graduation . i'm proud of myself for never giving up better things are yet to come . I can't wait to be successful in life and no matter how many times I fail , I'll still keep trying because at the end of the day everything will be worth it . I know I'll thank myself for not giving up even after so many mistakes.

Does failure cause me to lose enthusiasm ? No It doesn't it brings more energy to me , to keep moving , to keep my head u , and to keep trying . It may be different for other people but I will keep agreeing with Churchill's statement .

Reasons:

You can have a healthy life doing always something.

It helps you to learn some new things or new activities to do.

You can get a job easily if you have the requirements from school like diploma, but also you have to be doing your work or somethings benefitial for your life and not just living in a hose without doing nothing.

In the world there is alot of people that doesn't have a job and they live witout doing something, because the goverment it's giving money and free food to that people.

All the things and work people do is for something benefitial and to have money and food to survive and have some resources, they get all that with effort and doing something that really helps them, because if you don't do nothing I don't think your live would be so easy and have everything you need.

555670A36602,"Does technology has a positive or a negative effect on people's lives ?

Technology has change the way in how people buy things in online without going to the store. Also, technology has a unlimited ways in how people can use it, and not only for buying things in online.

Technology has a positive effect on peoples's lives because know people can check for everything they want in online without going to the store, and it allows people communication without contact from other persons .

First, nowadays technology provide security for those people who don't like to go outside , so some people prefer shopping in online without going to the store. For example, Generic_Name is a collage student who has been assault many times in the library and she understand that she was in danger every time she was out side ,so Generic_Name decided to buy her material in online because she feels more safety. By putting her self in a safety place Generic_Name wont get assault again.

Thus , technology can provide security , and it make online stores a safety place to shopping.

Secondly , technology allows people communication without human contact and this a great advantage for those people who are far from their countries.

For example, Generic_Name is a Dominican immigrant who has been in U.S. for 4 years and the only way that she can communicated with her family is with a cell phone. Generic_Name's cell phone provide her communication,

without going to Generic_City. Thus,

technology play a good roll in people who are far from their countries.

Some people may say that technology has a negative effect in people's lives because technology has made people slaves that only depends on technology.

For example, Generic_Name is a student who use the phone for cheat in algebra class , every time she use the phone for math problems she get good grades , but one day Generic_Name forgot to bring her phone to class and her teacher gives her a exam and she fail. Generic_Name fail exam because she become independent to her phone. However, this argument is such a lie because it all depend in how people use technology as a good way or as a bad way .

In conclusion , technology play a important roll in the society. people know can check online stores everything they want, at any time they want. Also, technology provide people communication without having contact with others. Technology has become a essential tool for humans that allows people to complete many tasks .

Every single day that we spend in school is like a treasure, and those memory could not fade. Rush from four years to three years are not good for students, and try to finish high school fast is not a good idea for them.

Firstly, study are the thing that we could not rush. By anyway, student need take time to memorize what things the have learned in school, to accumulate experience, then use that knowledge and experiences in real life. Much students who from another country came to this country to learn. Start with zero English, they almost can not communication with other students or teacher, so they need to take time to learn English, and other subjects, therefore, if someone tell them rush out of high school, they will give up. Not just study, they need to accommodate with new word, new country they come. Because anything are different.

Secondly, every student who are under eighteen are kids, and kids need to play, to study, to rest; after all of that, they become adult. please do not coerce kids to act, to study like adults. In high school , kids are easy to make friends, enjoy with their friends, to confidences to each other, so use all of free time in afternoon everyday or in summer for study is a bad idea for them. Also, use all of time in elective class to study are bad idea too. In elective classes, the student can learn experience from their teacher or keep a good health in physical health class. Stop all of elective class, sport and spent that time for study lead to stressful, stress to much lead to crisis metal or trauma.

Finally, Use 1 year in high school, in boyhood to study or work are undeserved. After high school, students go to college will not have much time to make friends because they all are focus on study, It become hard to make friends. If after high school they look a job, it could be make friends with coworker, therefore, it much different with how they make friends in high school, because all of them are adult now, the mature thinking create a wall between them, so they hard to become friends.

Between a person who spent three years in high school and successful in their life, and other person was enjoy four years in high school and also success too, which one is better? And one day, when their grandchildren ask them about their commemorate in high school, the person who was took four years much have more story in high school than person who took three years in there.

739B9009D8D2,"While students are in Middle School in 8th grade, they get the opportunity to see many career's and see which one are they planning to take or have an idea of the career. students should have the opportunity to choose their own career, sometimes students are force to take the career that their parents want. Why? because in many occasions they do not have another choose. In this decade teenagers have the right to choose the career that they want to study. In High School students are preparing and learning different elements and different skills, however; learning others skills benefit teenagers in their future. How? and Why? because learning different skills prepared teenagers for any jobs or if they have any kind of problem anywhere. Guiding students for what they like since a young age is an acceptable idea because they learn more and more each day. Their mentality is improving each day. For example: They try to look for information, asking people that already have experiences with the career that they are thinking to take. After Middle School and High School students are ready to start college and they should be assuming what is best for them.

In some parts of the world teenagers do not have the opportunity to go to school, countries that do not have good recursive, for example: Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Africa. In those kind of countries many teenagers do not go to school because they prefer to work beside of going to school, their education is not good enough. That is why so many people come to U.S. because they know that the education that U.S brings them is their future. Each Teenager comes with a dream to U.S. Kids at age of 12 of those countries comes with big mentalities with big dreams, that is what helps many teenagers to choose a good career in U.S, at young age they know that they have to make their family proud and be the alpha of the family with a good career. Also as the population in those countries is increasing day by day is harder to find a job even if you had a good diploma it do not matters. The society in those countries when kids want to go to school their parents don't let them, ""the education here is not going to guide you anywhere"" that is what they said, that is why now days are many terrorism in many countries because parents takes the dreams of their children and through them to the trash. Many parents should give teenagers the opportunity of studying and talk them about how important is to have a good education and let them think about the career that they want at young age.

The importance of knowing and thinking about the future at young age has been an impact in now days, because in many cases around the world teenagers do not think about their future, they do not care about school, jobs, education, or their family, but in U.S teenagers have many chances of getting a good job and getting a good healthy life and a great education.

Teenagers will have their life set after High School.

Teenagers are going to be an inspiration for others.

They will have a good job.

Ensuring that students should have their career in mind by the time that they enter to High School for them to learn more and preparing when they get to college and learn much more and be an inspiration for many other teenagers and for others to think of the importance of having a good education and career.

Lening never wanted to be idle,for he kept on playing Apex Legends to be good at it. He worked hard. He reached his goal of winning a match on Apex Legends. Lening reached his goals because he was never idle, for he was always doing something in his life. Although some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore, actually being active serves a purpose because we can increase our knowledge in; work,home and gaming and if we are studying a subject such as; Medicine, 3D Animated Cartoons and CyberSecurity we can master it ,and later on we can teach others.

Some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore. Once a read an article on Newsela that was about how a men waited to start his goal, and he ended up getting his goal very quick. The man was called Generic_Name. Generic_Name wanted to save up to buy a house. He started ti save up for two months, later on he won the lottery, Generic_Name was very happy about it, then he deposited all his money into his savings account. Time pass by and he realized he had enough money to buy his dreamed house. Generic_Name bought the house, and he lived happily ever after.

If we are inactive we can wait for the right moment to start and errand or chore. My Aunt(Generic_Name) wanted to do and errand but she decided to wait because she saw on CNN News that if we wait to do and errand or chore the succession rate increases by 25%. She did the errand and it went more smoothly than ever, he waited to do it and she succeeded on doing it.

Being inactive for a while it's good because if we decide to rush things the odds might be against us. My friend Generic_Name always like to rush things. One day he couldn't wait to buy a game that he went in the middle of the night to buy it. When he got to the store, the store was already closed. He walked form the game store to his house. He was very sad that he could not bought the game, later on he saw a women in white standing right in front of him. He woman in white turn down and he saw her.. the we ran like crazy. It's always better to wait to do something such as buying a game, don;t rush things or you will end up like Generic_Name.

The people will see the how successful they can be. People have to be determine for be successful in their life and always do their best. If people just want o be lazy and do nothing they do not will done nothing big in their life.

When the people are working hard and doing something good. They can be successful. Because the best people are always giving everything they have and, Working hard, If you have a gold. The way for done that do not will be easy. Are obstacle in all the way. For overcome people have to be working on that each day. They are getting different experiences in they way. The life it is hard and, People can not be idle. Because the key for the successful it is always work hard and never give up. When the people work hard, and done one of their goal. They will feel proud of their self. Because they know that goal it is complete now, thanks for they determination and hard work. The like it is better when you have to work hard.

The world it is a hard place. The people have different perspective. The majority of them try to give them best. But he other part just prefer do not do something and, Just trust in the destiny.

They prefer be idle. This people do not do nothing successful. Because do not work hard. The idle people can have big consequences in the future like, homeless, bad lifestyle or have trouble with their family. Sometimes this people have to pass for really hard situation for be the way they are. But others just prefer be like that. Because can come from rich family and they do not have to do nothing for have all their want or, just people than do not think the consequences can have for be idle or have long inactivity time. When someone have long break time. It is more hard to go back to the activities. And make people do a wrong decision. Like the kids stop to study or adults stop to working.

Everybody work different. When people work hard, They can see in their result. But also your body can felled. People needs an inactivity time for short time period. With that they can realize their activities and give the best. Because when you work hard, without break time. After some period can be a issue. But if the people are in inactivity time for long period and do not work hard. Do not will done their goal. Because more hard you work, more successful you will be in the life.

When people tell me ""Don't give up, try harder next time"" It help me past the objective that made me fail comes back, and it makes me want to try my hardest this time. Failure is important because without failure life will just be easy. Failure is a very imporant part to becoming succeesful because, it gets you where you want to be in life.

Failure is always a big part to success because everyone has to go though it to become successful in life. They might have failed a test or might failed something important, but when they get it again they will practice to succeed the next time. Everyone will go though something that failed them in life. Life with failure is hard sometimes, but it gets you where you want to be in life. Failure shows who you are, because if you fail too much you can be grumpy all the time because you don't try at all.

To become succeesful you have to go though failure first. You will feel how it is to fail, so you can try harder the next time. Failure to success is important to us because, you will just pass everything without doing anything at school. Some people try hard in school and other don't so they fail and do better the next time and succeed. Everyone says ""Failure is the key the success"". So you can go though challenges to become successful.

Others might say failure isn't a big part to success because some grow up already successful. They never went though a challenge. Without failure life will be too easy. You don't have to worry about failing, you will just be successful the whole time. Life won't be challenging. You won't get anywhere in life without failure.

In conclusion, failure is a very imporant part to success. You won't get anywhere in life without failure. Success is part of failure too because when you pass more challenges come. Failure to succes is a big role in life, because you lose a little hope, but when you success you gain more hope in yourself.

5D0E66357C33,"Recently, Generic_School school board is considering to add one and a half hour to school each day due to students do not have enough time to study at school. However, many students and parents disagree with extending the school day. In fact, adding more time has many disadvantages instead of advantages like the school's expectation. For instance, students at Generic_School are going to have less time for school's clubs and their program at high school, or students will be tired and may not study effectively. In addition, this change could take away their free time after school. Therefore, I am not an exception of the population who strongly disagree with extending the school day.

First of all, students at Generic_School have limited school time because teenagers are not able to go home lately for their safety and privacy. Although they do not have much time, most of them are joining clubs or doing high school's activities. Due to this limited time at school, if Generic_School decides to make students spend more time at school, they will not have enough time for after school programs. In fact, joining social club and doing sport are some beneficial ways for school life, so students should not quit them. Therefore, adding more time could ruin hose beneficial activities for students. For example, Generic_Name must at his house at seven in the afternoon, so he has about three hours to do his sport program at high school. But then, his school requires him to stay for ninety more minutes. After that, he just has one and a half hour for his after school activity, which is a little amount of time.

In additionally, adding more time to school each day may cause students the lack of attention to their teachers. Studying for a long time definitely will make students become tired. Recording to scientists, it is more difficult for people to be focus when they are tired because their brain may not evaluate the information very well. For this reason, they may not be focus in class and receive brilliant knowledge for test. Students also may not solve their homework and prepare for the next class because they do not understand their lesson. And because of the tiring students, teachers could not teach them effectively too. Consequently, this problem is going to affect their grade. If this horrible problem lasts for a long time, studying will be stressful for those teenagers.

Another reason to consider, extending more time causes the scarcity of free time for students. To date, students just have six hours after school until the perfect time for them to sleep. Which is not a large amount of time to discover something new to do and avoid their days become monotonous. However, after this change, students will only have four hours for their free time. This change absolutely will take away their time for hobbies, family, and time to relax. With four hours, students are just able to have dinner, do their homework, and prepare for test. They do not have time for anything else.

In conclusion, the lack amount of time for after school program, scarcity of attention to classes, and less free time are some valuable reasons make I strongly disagree with extending the school day. This option makes school life become more stressful and causes many consequences. Studying should be beneficial and exciting, not be an affliction for teenagers.

I think the people cant do nothing without help because is necessary to have help from others. people who dont us technology I think is negative because without technology the people can do nothing for example they cant to have contact with other or for a jobs.

They need to know what they want to do when they grow up. Their course of study in high school will help them to choose what career they think they suppose to do. They have to focus to what career they choose and they gonna fathom out that career .Example ,when a student want to be a doctor when he grow up that's why he have to focus to learn well biology and all about the doctor's job.

going for a ride in you bike to the park is good for your body and mind because your leg movements aid the muscles, the fresh air blowing in your face feels relaxing, and because you can burn unnecessary calories while riding.

It is good to go to the park with your family because you can get some helpful advises from them, because you can have a stronger bond with you family and/or friends, and because you can talk about life problems and how to solve them.

it is best to fly a kite at the park because when flying kites, you have to maintain it's height which is a good challenge, because you can compete with friends, and because you can teach others how to fly a kite

Overall, riding a bike and spending time with your family are both good things to do at the park. life aiding activities exist outdoors all around the world.

83F2A3B31F21,"Having self-reliance is probably one of the most important skill that a person must needs to develop and learn how to use it. By having self-reliance we are able to express what our instincts and ideas. Self-reliance means that you are able to take a decision based on what you think is good and better usually for yourself. Self-reliance have many goods outcomes for your life, some of them affects your personal inner you. Increases the self-esteem, you earned more knowledge and experiences when you fail, and you are more likely to be more happy when you do what you think is good.

Being able to have self-reliance is important because it makes you feel that you have your own opinion and that your word is important where you are. Self-reliance doesn't just help you with your outside life but also helps you with the inner you by making you feel good about yourself feeling that you are intelligent and trust worthy. When you make your own decisions it proves to your-self that you are mature enough and your self-esteem increases by a lot. You are more likely to be happy when this things happens.

Everyday we found ourselves making a decision it can be at the groceries store, when driving deciding which turn you are going to make and even at the restaurant deciding what to order. In most of the cases they are going to be harder decisions. Sometimes we are going to fail by making the wrong decision, maybe we bought the wrong thing at the grocery or we took the wrong turn or even order the wrong thing at the restaurant. is important that we understand that it's okay when we fail. We actually learn more when made the wrong decisions we are able to gain more knowledge when we use our self reliance. when somebody tells you what to do we decreases the chances to learn something from our experience. since there is people telling you what to do we go home with not knowledge or experience.

Doing what you like the most is beneficial for our daily life. One of the example that I can best give you is when we are choosing what career we want to pursued for our future job. You would want to do something that you like and that is going to make you happy when doing it. For these kind of decision we have to apply self-reliance because we need to find out what do we like to do the most and we need to trust ourselves, when taking this decisions. Then we go to college and we study what we believed it was the best decision.

No doubt that when we seek guidance from an experts when making a decision, your chances of making the right decisions are higher, you are more likely to succeed when doing it. Being able to have an experts by your side that is going to guide you, is good because you have a second person give you its opinion and helping you to go through daily decisions. Having a mentor prevents you from making wrong decisions that might affect your life in bad way. Of course discussing important matters with a instructor is important because can help you and release some stress that you might have.

Self-reliance is the trust that you put in yourself believing that what you are doing is right. We use it everyday as more decision comes up. I believe that each individual should be able to make their own decision and have self-reliance. Because when you use your own ideas and opinions you are more satisfy with yourself and you are more likely to live a happy life. There are a lot of advantages for when there is self-reliance, is on us if we want to decide whether we are going to use it or not.

They can check out books, shops, and play games without speaking to another person. Some people thinks the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology have positive effects on people's lives because technology makes more easy their lives, for example they not need to leave their houses for buy or to joint with another person to play games. However, I think the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology have negative effects because people prefers to shop on online than stores, people use more technology to talk, and also children plays with technology than with another person or toys.

Today, people prefers to shop by online than stores. I saw and lived this experience many times about buy by online but I not feel comfortable as a store. Online shops makes feel lazy, alone, and when you have questions obout the product nobody can answer you. I bought by online many times but one day I understand that online shop is not healthy for me because when I go to stores I'm practicing my English vocabulary, I walk alot that means that I doing a little exercise, and meet new places and people. Shop by online avoid the human contact and gives negative effects on people's lives.

People use more technology to talk, as facetime, facebook, whatssap or others applicationes. I agree to talk with this aplications with people who lives far away but I prefer to join with my friends or family to talk who lives close. Sometimes, I came out with my sister and their friends who always are in their phones texting or taking pictures. In my personality, use the phone when you are sharing with another person is not respect and you are not enjoying the moment. The use of phones during a meeting avoid the interaction with other human, and gives negative effects on the people's live.

Finally, children more plays with technology than with another child or toys. In the past, children plays with toys or they made their own toys. This helped to children to developed their imagination or decover their skills. Also, children invented plays involving run, saltar or make force; this plays helped to children to enjoy healthy and socialiting with other child.

E20DE200FEA8,"There are people who believe that true self-esteem comes from praising the student's work and others believe that true self-esteem comes from achievement. There are situations where a student should feel that his real hard work is considered good by praising his work. There are some students that feel that their work was good, because of their achievements. There are some types of students:

Students that make themselves feel especial when their work is appreciated

Students that feel that their work was hard by achievements

Students that even if they do not try their best, want their work to be praised in order to learn

Students the feel themselves in a position to learn when they do not give their best effort and it is praised

There are many students that deserve their work to be praised to build self-esteem, because they have really tried their best in order to get their work done, but there are many students who do not deserve their work to be praised, especially if they have not tried their best on their work. Those students who try their best on their work, they deserve their work to be praised, so that they can notice that the real hard work that they have done is appreciated. It would make them keep their hard work.

There are some people that truly believe that true self-esteem comes from achievements. It makes a lot of sense, because achievements come from real hard work. If any student achieved what they wanted, it meas that they had worked hard for it. If people want to build true self-esteem through achievements it is a great idea that they have that on mind, because it would make them feel especial if they achieve it through hard work.

There are many circumstances where it depends on the type of people and situation where you want to build self-esteem. For instance, there are certain type of people that even if you praised their work will not keep it to build self-esteem. There are certain type of people that will. There are people that learn by achievements in order to build self-esteem.

6EC39DD682AF,"Do you ever get excited because you're planning to do something that you have time to do after school? I disagree with the school board planning to add one and a half hours to school each day, because it will affect students by doing after school activities, sports, and after school plans. It will also affect students by getting things done and things they are planning to do after school.

First reason why i disagree with the school board extending the school day, because it will affect students by doing after school activities, sports, and other plans. For example, there is some students that play sports and they have practice everyday and some others have it twice a week. Students that have practice everyday will get home late from practice; students that have practice twice a week will just get home late from practice just two days in a row. However, some students will seem to be tired at school and some others won't because not all of them have practice everyday after school. At practice. Coaches might give students time to get their homework done, but what if it's not enough time for them to get their work done? Students wont be able to finish their homework when they get home from practice, because it will be late and the reason would be, because school hours are way too long and practice will take their time from finishing their homework after school, and they will have to sleep to not be tired at school the next day. Another example could be when students have group projects to get done. The group of students that are doing the group project need to meet up somewhere after school, or they can all stay after school together. but, one student needs to go to practice, the other one needs to go to an after school activity, and only one of the students can stay after school to get the project done. Not every student will be able to get things done, because of the long hours of school.

Second reason why i don't agree with the school board adding one and a half hours to each school day, because some students have other things to do, or they need to get things done after school. For example, some students have younger siblings to take care of; some students have pets to take care of. Many students that have younger siblings, and they pick them up after school to Elementary School have to be on time for their younger siblings to get picked up. Other students have to pick them up from school to the babysitters, and they also have to be on time to the babysitter for their younger siblings to get picked up. If the school board adds one and a half hours to each school day, then some few students and their families will have to deal with these problems. School teachers give a specific time for the student to get picked up; babysitters give a specific time to take care of the kids. It will be kind of hard for families to look for a babysitter that can take care of their kids for one and a half hours more, and they also have to pay more. In the other hand, some students have pets, which they have to give them food after they come home from school. For example, if they have a Dog, He/She will have to take the dog outside, it will have to give it some food, and will have to play with it for a little while. It would also be kind of hard to find someone that could take care of its dog if He/She would come home late from school each day.

In conclusion, I think it would be a bad idea for the school board to add one and a half hours to school each day because, it would be more difficult for students and their families to get things done. Students wouldn't be able to finish their homework, projects, and more things after school, because they would come late home everyday from school. Students wouldn't be able to spend enough time with their family, because some students do sports, and they would only come home to sleep. Students would also be tired from doing sports after school; He/She wouldn't have enough time to get things done.

D01F88C1F2A0,"I believe that when people have their first impression on something they can change, people can have different impression and different changes no one has the same attitude as others

.Sometimes they don't even change because they don't care about it, and some of the people they get altered on something or on someone, it's based on what experiences people already had .

Some people don't even change when they have their first impression because they don't even care about it and people can change when they really give them a bad impression about them. Sometimes they keep doing the same thing every day and they don't even care about other people who are talking about them. But when they get another impression they start to think on what they did wrong and they analyze it. People start to change when they really need to change who they are. And to change takes time some people don't change quickly because they can commit the same thing without thinking it.

People can get impress on relationship about betraying each other, they can get altered on something or on someone . In a relationship their are always going to have problems it could be jealous, toxic, and bad influence. Many adolescents are dying just because they give them a impression about her/his boyfriend betraying them with another one and they don't even think about how hard is goig to be to that person knowing that they betraying them in that moment. Being on a relationship is not to impress others that they can get jealous at, sometimes changing is hard but it's a good way to have a good relationship.

In my experience, when I had my first impression I think that it was impossible for me to change myself. In that moment when they told me that I was a girl who disappointed other people about my attitude, I really feel very disappointed in me that I think negative everyday. And that I can not do what other people are good at. It was impossible for me to change my attitude because I was use to things that it was good for me but for others was not. So one day I say that I was going to change who I'm no matter how hard it was but it was going to be possible for me to change with or without help.

I believe that when people have their first impression on something they can change. changing is a good way to show to everyone that you are not the same person you use to be, and that every impression that they going to give you is going to be a way to try and to not commit the same thing in the future. People can say that it's impossible to forgot what we did in the past but when we try every day to forget it, we can get better to it. Everyone are not perfect but we can get better at changing our attitude on not trusting people who we think that it's not the kind of people were are going to trust.

People consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Success have motivation to do new ideas even if they can not do it. They push them self to keep trying because it makes them stronger as a hum being. Being enthusiastic makes you confident, in want to do more thing's in life. people push them self on being enthusiastic, it makes them excited on being confident in them self. More you try the more you want to get interest in exploring.

Having enthusiasm makes you happy it only gives you have positive thoughts. There are great people in the world that will give you advice. Telling you that you can do it if you only put your heart into it you can get it. Even if you fail always keep trying, you most likely would not get it the first time. Seeing other people on their success makes you have enthusiasm and make you uncomplash your own dreams.

Now in days their are people that expect if they try on doing something once they can not succeed again. Humans' relay on other's for their own achievement. Not having motivation makes you not want to do anything and you will keep failing. If you fail and fail, feel sad and give up you can become depressed. As you stop putting in effort in things you lose interest and do not try.

Failure is what makes you strong so you do not give up on trying. Failing is what should push you to make improvement and know your strength. Tell yourself to always think positive never negative you should have enthusiasm because that is what makes you stronger. Who you are is how you make of it and having interest on new things makes you a believer in yourself.

One of the key word is determination when someone have a positive attitude have the potential to make the goals real, if you want, you can do. You can inspired other person that maybe have problems in the school or in another place or maybe in the life, but you need to have determination and positive attitude for help at other person. Everything that you want is possible if you try, if you never try, you never know what is you potential, what you can achieve.

Never give up, a person that have a positive attitude have a positive mind, doesn't matter if have many problems never give up. In you mouth the word ""i can't "" not exist the all because everything depend on you. When you start something if you have a positive attitude you can't see back, because your eyes need to see only in front of you goal.

93D23741DD11,"I disagree with the idea of adding an hour and a half to school because students need to be taking a break from school. Students also might have chores to do at home, and their parents might be sick or other siblings, and if they get home early they don't have to worry or stress too much about it.

Students need breaks from school, while brain storming almost all day students also need to take a break from school specially if they had a bad day. Having to sit all day in a chair and do class work is not what every student in school wants to do, students need their body to be moving around doing other things. They need to get their mind thinking instead of wasting everything single thought on school work.

Besides having to do work at school students also need to do chores at home and if they don't get home early they wont finish them. some examples of chores students need to do include laundry, cut the grass, clean the house, and take out the trash so literally school doesnt help with all of that.

Sick parent or siblings, students need to get home early to help their parent if they're sick or if one of its siblings is sick to. students can get overly stressed over having to worry if their parents are alright, worry is what causes some students to not do work in school.

This are just some ideas in a million of them, I think students also have things more important at home than in school. specially those student that don't have a mom or a dad, thats why I think students shouldnt get home late. what if one of their siblings is dying and he or she doesnt even know.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,6.0,6.429483413696289,6

It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". It determine your personality, and helping others may recompense yourselves. We can achieve many goals by making things work the way we want it. And we do accomplish more when we are always doing the things we have to get done. It helps you a better person.

Theres a lot of people in this world that feel unless, because they think that they can do anything, we can help them. It feels satisfactory on changing life's, making things go other way for others. You must have the enthusiastic on getting things done. To make a lot of things work, and to make sure were helping others.

Help others and you will have done many things for the future of someone. And whenever you need help someone will help you back. Give back what you receive and be kindness.

It determine that you can change someone else life. If we are not the ones that help others who else is going to do it. It must be difficult, but we can change someone else's life.

Dear, Mr Generic_Name. I am a student who is in attendance at your high school, writhing to you about the changing of our school menu. I for one think it's a grate idea to change our school menu into a much healthier one.

Our current school menu has its redeeming qualities, but it also has a few lose ends. For example; they serve things like pizza, burgers, rice with chicken, nachos, spaghetti, Pb&j , and salad. Do you see the problem with the food items listed above? 99% of the schools menu contain high levels of fat and carbohydrates, which is not a proper meal for a growing student, or any human being. I remember seeing posters like the food pyramid, posted on the lunch room walls of my middle and elementary schools, but not once did the school lunches follow that expatiation. This is the problem with the school menus all over America today, they serve fatty foods filled with carbohydrates and not enough protein, fibers, and good fats.

As growing students, we need food that'll give us energy through out the day, and keep us focused in our classes, but the current menu isn't serving us the food we need; don't get me wrong, they have things like fruits, vegetables, and other good side options, but that's not enough. We need the main meal/ main dish to be the most healthiest thing on our trays, not the side dishes.

The students at our school may be disappointed with the sudden change in the school menu, but they'll just have to adjust to a healthier menu. It'll be nice if the school menu items was a bit more healthier, but the side options must stay the same. The side options our school menu currently have are just fine; they meet the expatiation's of a healthy side option; the offer fruits vegetables and the occasional desert.

The health of your students and my peers are important, and a big part of being healthy starts with what you put in your body, so please continue with the plan of changing the school menu, our future self's will deeply appreciate it. Thank you for our time.

BDAE1D4B6C20,"The quote, '' hard work pays,'' means a lot when it comes to doing something and one staying idle. The world today upgrades itself each and everyday,which tells us that we should always be doing new everyday as humans.

Although some people say that been idle is the best way to go because it relaxes the body and gives it a new form of strength actually doing something always not only exposes one to new ideas and strategies but also makes the human body active and vibrant at all times. There are a lot of chances one can benefit from been productive other than been idle.

To start with, there are a lot of goodness in been productive than been an idle man. People who invest in their time to produce something meaningful are known across the globe because of their hard work and dedication. Due to how hardworking they are, they get the chance to explore new ways of doing things and new ideas that would help them in their next exploitation. For instance, since Bill Gates is hardworking man, he is known across the globe and due to this he has been exposed to other new things that would help him in whatever he is doing now. Again, when there is a football match between two different teams, and if one team is seen practicing so hard than the other, it would be considered that the team seen practicing the most would deliver more than the other team with no doubt.

Moreover, doing something always makes an individual active and lives longer than been idle. A person who is seen to be doing something productive all the time is considered to be adding more years to his or her age due to the fact that working tirelessly everyday helps keep the body in form and shape which by so doing prevents diseases that attack people. For instance when a person walks about a half and a mile to work everyday, it is very difficult to see that individual get sick because the body is always busy looking for something to do. On the other hand, idleness brings nothing but retrogression and failure because you're not able to bring forth anything productive and therefore it becomes a waste of time,energy and resources. One can make the comparison so easily between a productive person and someone been idle, a productive person can always be seen advancing from one stage to the other while an idle person will be seen at the space that he is at always.

Furthermore, when people say '' time is money,'' they are definitely talking about how one is able to use his available to produce something meaningful for himself to get money and have some other benefits as well. No one gets rich by just sitting at home, folding his hands and just expect something to happen. People may argue on this that one can make it in life when he or she inherits the possession from his family. This may be true because you may have everything to yourself but everything will be squandered if one does not work hard to top it up or add more to what he has. People choose idleness because it is more relaxing and the easiest way to go because you just sit there and wait for whatever happens to happen. Been idle can also affect a person in way or the other. In the sense that, if a person is seen to be at one place all the time, it may be considered that the person may be lazy and this may deprive him off certain opportunities that might help him in one way or the other.

Last but not least, working hard or been productive gets one a recognition or a specific type of award that goes a long way in life. There is no doubt about the fact that people who work hard are awarded the most and are the ones that are shown to the world for others to see and emulate their footsteps. For instance, Usain Bolt has been winning almost all his race in the Olympics and it sends a good message about him to the world because of how hardworking he is. Due to this someone else can decide to emulate his footsteps to become a world star like him.

Again no one chooses to be last in whatever he is doing but rather aims at the high spot. Although some people say that been idle is the best way to go because it relaxes the body and gives it a new form of strength actually doing something always not only exposes one to new ideas and strategies but also makes the human body active and vibrant at all times.

It always good to look at the brighter side of good and it is always advisable to go for what is right. Productivity brings a lot of good things in a person's life than any other thing a person can think of while Idleness brings nothing but retrogression in one's life.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,7.0,7.8546528816223145,8
9174D620243B,"Do you think that the students should take classes from home?

In this paper I will argue about, why the students should not take classes from home and reasons why is better go to school.

Many students when finish the high school, have the option to take online classes or go to collage,however the majority to prefer the idea to take class from home and is good, but have negative parts like:

Questions; if you have a specific question, that need be explain with details, you can't do it, like a mathematic problem, experiments or when use correctly a world. Personal I have many questions during my English class, like when use ""commas, period, capilazation worlds, write a essay"" and my teacher come to me and explain me how is the correct way to do that.

Time; some classes or topics required time to understand really well, but online classes are limited with the time, for example the subject World History for me, some topics are confused and need a slowly and at great lenght explication like ""differences between Greece and Rome, Origin of Christianity"" and my World History teacher explain me thoroughly, when, how and what happened is these eras.

Homework; someones think that the homework is unnecessary, but I think it's, my Algebra teacher sometimes, he leave me homework to practice the lesson and to memorize the formulas, that's helpful for me, because during the test I remember what I saw during the class.

The students think that online classes are great, because they don't need wake early, make homework, spend a long time in a specific class or go to a building, however their are wrong.

In my opinion take classes on the school permitted me have a personal and direct conversation with my teacher, share differents ideas with my partners, have more details about a topic and tell what I understand and what not.

In the future school have better technology and students want to take classes in a classroom for use the modern machines or electronic devices and esay way to learn.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,7.0,5.574047565460205,6

0F85B38CBFD7,"Being successful is going from failure to failure with out giving up; it can one day lead to success.

in my opinion I agree with the Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Because being successful it's not easy to accomplish you will have to take two steps back to take one step forward. In the other hand some other people believe that successful is easy and that it's just a strait path with no curves, with no problem. some reasons why I believe failure can make you succeed are.

for some people money can be an issues and that can be a problem to become successful.

Another reason is the amount of effect you will be putting because you might lose interest and give up on the goal you set yourself.

lastly not having the right friend to support you to give you advice.

For many people money could be a problem to be successful. Personally this is also an issue that I will have to deal with once I graduate high school. I will have to go on and work to be able to attend a collage, but thats what I have to do to try and be successful. I will have to take a step back to be able to accomplish my goal and go to collage.

Another example is that to be successful you will have to put a lot of interest, because once you lose interest you start to lose hope and wont want to keep on going with what you had made a goal on.

and lastly not having the right friend to give you advise and or support you to accomplish you goals.

for example is you have bad friendships they wont incurige to on your school work or out side school. there people that might incurige you to do drugs only so that they can take advantage of you. they may be a reason why you are not successful you might not be with the right people.

In conclusion i strongly agree with Winston Churchill because to became successful you will have a lot of thing to do and get through a lot. others believe that success is easy that with no effort they will accomplish what they want in the time that they wan.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,6.0,6.319849491119385,6
DB0A595A4723,"Dear Principal,

I write this letter to you because children are not suppose to perform community service. so sometimes children have time to do community service, and some don't have time to do it. For me I rather kids not doing community service because maybe they have better thing's to do. first of all, that kids have to do homework and important projects. secondly, children have the choice to do community service. finally, children have to do chores at home or help mom do something important.

first of all, kids have to do homework and important projects and that's because they have final project for the quarter, but you have to do community service what do you rather do i rather do my project for the quarter. Also homework is a important thing in your school grade and you also have to another community service again, and it is important too and that's why children are not suppose to take community service it take away to much time from important things like family, class work, and projects.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,6.0,6.374415874481201,6
CF2D1F83542F,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Not me! In my opinion students shouldn't have attend classes from home because for me is not necessary you know why? because most of the students should be preparing to put effort and go to the school. Now in today we have a lot of technology to learn more better about what you what to know. We have the school for learn more important things instead of to attend classes from home. Some ladies who get pregnant and then the baby is born has the opportunities to have classes from home because they can not lost their credits or to be absent during their diet that's mean that is a good way.

First, the school would give you a more better choice instead of classes from home because many students should be lazy. For example students who take classes from home can eat whatever time they want and can study at the same time, they can go to the bathroom without any permission and when they want it but it's a problem because we the students have the energy and the capacity to go to school and learn more instead at home. Also we have more problems that some students don't understand and that's why they prefer attend classes from home. Furthermore they don't have any teacher who can help you, anybody who gave you any idea about to resolve a problem. You can not take things seriously and you have to work independently not as a group.

Second, some students have many opportunities and doesn't make a good use, you have to appreciate what the school is offer you because them you still make the same mistake every day and if you want to grow up you have to make good choices. Every students have different thoughts about study some of them waste their time using their cellphones instead they can be study and it's bad because in a future they don't won. Students likes to put endanger their knowledge because they prefer to copy to somebody and not doing the difficult things by themselves.

Third, parents have to put control on this because, if they don't emend their children's them when they go to school doesn't like because in school there are many rulers that the students should follow and if you are in home there don't exist any rule that can trust you and that's why some students are spoiled with the teachers. The school is for people who really want to studied. The students have to be always preparing because is the best way that you can be a great person in the life. If you put part of you in everything even so doesn't matter where you are if in the school or in your home, because when you want something you doing well and you have success in your life.

In conclusion, students shouldn't benefit to have classes from home, is a worse idea that a student can have because this problem could have serious consequences in your life as a young you're. You students had to work striving for better opportunities. Classes from home doesn't help you so that's why you have to go to school and support yourself, if you want to be someone in the life, ""Don't be lazy, you can do it, be proud of who you are"".",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.0,3.0,6.0,5.699730396270752,6
A0D37DDFBE96,"There is a lot of ways to safe energy and conserve resources, but not all the pepole follows along with them. As an example for that could be, that every time people is not using a light at their house they must turn it off. Also when students use their computers at school for a long time just playing games and charging it, it's a waste of energy. Not every body understand how important the energy is. This is why bussinesses and schools should adopt a four-day week, with each day consisting of then hours.

Having a four-day work week has their benefits. Workers would only work four days and have three day weekend, they would have more time to rest, and have a time with their families. On the other hand working requires using energy for any type of power tools as computers, printers, and construction tools. Working four days a week will decrease the use of energy.

Also some people drive to their job, and others ride the bus, using this method of working only four days a week will safe the people more resources, as gasoline, money, and vehicles.

As working four days a week has their benefits, it also has their disadvantages. students would have to go school, and workers would have to go to work only four days a week, of each day consisting of ten hours. Students would have to stay at school two more hours, meaning they would waste more energy as they usually do. Workers would waste a very big amount of enegy due by the power tools they use. Students would only go to school for four days, and wokers to work for only four days as well, but each day constis in ten hours, however they still will work for forty hours, as if they worked five days a week, workers and studets will be wasting the same amount of energy and resources.

Being a student and going to school for only four days a week and having a three day weekend has their benefit. Students would have more time to complete their homework, and study for tests. On the other hand going to school requires to waste some energy, and resources, students uses their computer that they need to charge, and teachers uses paper every day, while using this method students and tacher would safe resources and energy. Some students drive to school, others take the bus, or they also drive to academies, this all relates to the wasting of energy and resoruces as gasoline. Otherwise going to school for only four days a week, will decease all the energy used in computer, and the gasoline the cars need to get students to school.

Students going to school only four days a week has their benefits and disadvantages. Students would waste less energy than they do in five days, they aslo would waste less gasoline and money if they only come four days. Having this method the comminuty would safe a lot of energy and resources that can be need it for the future. Schools should follow this model by extending the school days two hours and waste less energy and resources. ",3.5,2.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,7.0,7.261124610900879,7
F8F503B765DA,"i say that we shoudn't have more hours of school , because it will just make us be more sterssed b working. we wil barly have free time to o what t do but more time time in school wil make us tired and weak we will need more food. it will cost the school more food and it wil cost more money and light to wast on teaching. Kids won't learn because they are going to say why did they put more school time and thats all they are going to say the the whole time. It will make it all more busy for the teachers they will get mad and say how they can't do that much hours they got kids they got thing to take care of.

The school will need to whas't more money on food and electicion bill just for one more hour of education and kids won't even learn alote because they will be to busy complaining and say that they want to go home. the school board will just was't money for no reason. school is doing good already so do not mess it up by an hour of school. The teacher will work more time ,so they will get paid more. So if u do put one more hour of school if a kid needs to stay after would they stay an other hour of school that would mean that the teacher would gets a bigger pay cheack and that would be alote of students so teachers would have to stay for ciuds to so that would be longer and by the time its done it will be dark.

The school will need more volnenters because they don't want to pay teachers more already because they already do because they have an other hour of school left so they will have to beg the teachers to volnter to to stay. School will need to think of more thing to do in the school to fill up the hour.

we will not want to go to school. we will be so tired and and to know that we have an other hour of school i would be done for the day. I would not feel like going to school every day because i would be more tired . it will give me less free time to us because we got sleep earlyer because we are tired.

we will get mad because we don't got free time alote and that would effect our school day. Kids will feel that school is to much work and might tell there parents and the parents might tell the school to lower it down. The school will will get complans form parents that there kid is stressing to much so that would be bad and school will have to cancil the one hour. Thats why i think it is a bad idea to put one more hour of school all of the people will disagree i would to because it will just make me stressed out and give less free time. I think school should leave the hours alone since they don't have to deal with the work and tired ness they don't have to think twice.

I think it is dumb to add an hour more because it can mess up every thing. If every thing is doing good then it should stay like that if we need to change it we should all chose if we want a to have one more hour or not. We are the important voteers so why leave us out of it. We are the ones who get tried ,so one more hour and 30 mintues is not good for are bodys even worse if you have after school or a clud. The money that you had to use for the extra time could go to better things like new computers for us. Or it could help for better lunches or better gym oqupment or mucic things and make the school better by painting it or somthing. Instead of was'ting it on one hour of paying teachers. I would like to have free time not streeing out about doing work and being done and haveing little free time.

2BAF09F7004D,"As we know the modernization through the years is bringing us new advances in technology. One of the most important and positive effects of use of technology is make life more easy for everyone. I mean, the use of social media is given us a lot of way to communications no matter where we are; the facilities of communication and information on time are essential to accomplish many task. The complexity to communicate and create different way to interact had making a great way to a efficient communication.

First of all, the use of technology is currently having big impacts in our lives. It is changing through the years the way how the humanity is living. There out are a lot of brilliant brain creating new advances in technology everyday. The expansion of the new advances day by day is given us a renovation of our life style. The interactions between everyone through communication using different devices such a computer, phone, iPad, etc.. The principles of those project of advances created and expended by people expert in technology; the've been implement the necessity of technology in every single places. It can also influenced our mental and physical health; depression and anxiety are common nowadays so there are website to providing helps online. The variety how we can combine knowledge in technology are infinities. That is one of the main reasons.

Secondly, we are breaking all the limitations that we had before. If you are trying to communicate and if you were in large distance was limited because we did not have those resources such a Mobile devices. So now, we are currently, sending messages or texts, even we can do video calls on live simultaneous. This factor was not possible without the technology. Everyone is connected around the world. Those limitations are breaking because all the different social media:

Facebook: One of the most famous and popular website to post, share videos, photos, websites, links.

Twitter: This app is used mostly to post personal thought or opinions.

Instagram: To post and now with new implement of sources for marketing.

Gmail: It is one of the most popular account to mail. It is like Email but it is more modern.

Email: is mostly used to messages.

Blogs: is used to shared a personal version. It can be about life style, hobbies. Anything you want.

YouTube: This is a platform with the purpose of given us videos some of them can promoting companies.

In addiction, one of the important advantage is the facilities to do everything we want, when we want, where we want. The use of technology in school, colleges even work implement the easy way to accomplish everything. Now days, school bring to their students computers with the the purpose of advances in every single student to do their homework/assignments in home with all the necessary facilities. They want to give students information through books that you can easily get online. In the pass, it was impossible because you had to go to the library and get the permission to read a few books. So, now with the technology we can also use the technology with the purpose to sell or buy things online. Amazon is a good example of success marketing in the world. People buy things on Amazon because they do not have enough time to go to the store and buy their stuff. The platform of amazon is giving us enough details about those items that we want to buy. The majority of shop stores or companies have websites. This is creating a red of new jobs. Some people can work even in home using any device because technology is making that possible. Sometimes, the use of technology can be optional but something is a necessity. We have to adapt to the new modernization. That is because technology.

Although even, there are some statements about some negative effects of technology such a limitation of communication, I can prove with real facts how the technology facility the interactions of contact to other people for example: group chat, messages, Facetime, live videos. Students can be connected with their classmate or vice verse even with their teachers. They just have to be connected. Social media is creating a direct and indirect connection to others, I mean the students can have conversations about projects or assignments through their phones or any device. The use of technology can be fun. We can use technology in video games and some of them have communication though microphone and we can really interact with our partner. We also can extend the communication and interact not just once or two as many as we want. Technology is given is entertainment. Sometimes we just want to be in our conform zone and that is okay. So it's up to us if we want to work, play with somebody else or by ourselves.

It's true that we can decide if we want to work, have fun by ourselves but the technology bring us the opportunity to interact with others.

Finally, the use of technology is part of our lives already. We can deny the use of it in our daily activities. A simple example: If we are going to get a job, mostly of the applications are online. Every job is associate with technology. The use of them created good benefit in everyone. The effects of technology depends with the purpose we are using it. If our purpose is to using the technology to good benefit, the used of them will be successful either the purpose is about good or bad things.

""Every action, have a reaction"" Isaac Newton.

The results of our good action will always have a positive effect.

I can concluded, all those positive effects are making our work more easier. The use of technology in our society is impulsing us to be betters every day. All the results of hard works by every of us. The innovation of those advances are creating new mechanisms in our routine, new life style and all that is because we are smart enough to created technology, everything started from us. The majority of people is using technology with good purposes. The world is doing better because technology.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,7.0,6.408619403839111,6
F75D6E5CCE78,"Imagine how life would feel like when you can't have your favorite food at your favorite spot in school? would it even be fun to go to school or not. About a week or two ago i went to Panda Express to grab some food on my way home but at the time that I got there, I asked to get some white rice with some orange chicken but the workers told me they have changed their menu a little bit so i can't have some,at that point i fell so sad because that was the only spot that sold some in town. I think the change of the school menu would be a bad idea because,it will make students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way,it would also bring some money problems in school and it would also make some students keep on empty stomach during the school day till they get home to prepare some food.

secondly,If students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way andthey never came back, this would leave the parents worried because since the principal decided to change the menu they would have a reason for leaving school ground. Mr. principal i would be happy to tell you to leave the menu like how it is because it would make some students get in trouble and a lot of incidents will happen when they leave.0nce a bad incident happen out of the school ground,the principal would be responsible for all the damages caused when they left, keeping the old menu would be a good idea but we don't want our accidents and school detentions to increase.

In addition to this it would cause some money problems because if students are going to have to eat healthy then how would they gain more money easily to support the school when they are in needs of something. This is some of the way you can make more money so, Mr principal if you decide to change it the school is going to have to shut down at a point because when is no money to operate the school and pay the teachers and custodians they would have to leave their job and get a better one and once everyone one is gone there would be any teachers to teach the students. Mr principal because of this reason we should keep the old menu so that students and teachers can enjoy their selves in the school.

Therefore if the principal end up using the healthy menu this will led to some students getting sick because they will have to leave their stomach empty and they can't have what they want. This will cause a protest in the county because they supposed to eat what they like, and what the cafeteria think will be good for them to eat. In case of this of this reason the teachers will teach for no reason because the student are so focused on going home to eat what their mom or dad have prepared waiting for them,so if the principal wants them to focus in class then he is supposed to give them what they like.

In conclusion i think leaving the old menu would be a good idea because if the principal wants the students to try to improve in their class then he should leave it. Therefore if the students wants to add th healthy menu on it then he should let them vote on it whether they agree on what he is saying but i would say leaving the old one should be the best for the students.

In these days technology is one of the most important equipment in life. Also young people can't survive without a cellphone or any technology because it is necessary for them. People should use more technology in their life because it will make their life better and easier.

First argument people with good knowledage of using technology are capable to do a lot of things that can help other people. People is capable to use computers and can make proyects and do their homework and they don't have to ask other people for help. Smartphones are necessity to survive in life and people with the help of the technology are capable to use them. Also people that have knowledge of technology can help the people that don't have the knowledge to use it.

Second argument people can have a better job if they have knowledge of technology. If people have good knowledge of technology they will have a good work. Technology is so important because it's almost everything around us and people have to know how to use it. People will not work harder than other people that don't know how to use technology. Also people will have a better job and a better life with good pay if they know how to use technology.

Third argument people can have a different type of life with the use of technology. People can have a easier life with the use of technology. Now people don't have to go buy or read books personality because they can do it online or can listen to the book with technology. People with modren life will know everything around the world. Also people can spend more time with their children using technology as videogames,cellphones,and computers.

In conclusion technology is one of the most importan things that people use. Technology is a good benefit to people because technology helps them and makes thier life easier. People that use technology will succces in life becuse techology is one of the most importnat equipment in life.

Some have relations with the police, hospitals etc..., but the one that caught my attention was your Aviation Academy because I like to construct, rebuild and inspect things that have an engine or wheels on it, I got skill such as leadership, patience ,and imagination, and I want to do something that I like in the future and theres nothing better to start has a student.

The Academy builds, rebuilds and inspect airplanes status. I was doing this since I was a little boy. I remember helping my Father fix his car engine and its electronic system. Another thing I remember is when I took my bicycle and broke apart to inspect the chane and the brake system. Helping my Father and Grandfather in the mechanic area was like getting a baby a new toy. It meant a lot to me to always help people in an area I

understand. I'am not saying that I know everything about mechanics or engineering

This is one of the reason I choose this program because I want to expand my understanding in the area of mechanics and engineering.

The Academy consist of teamwork, patience, and imagination. All of this skill I have mastered. Team members share ideas in how to solve the problem. In teamwork one another can check there work to make sure everything is correct. Patience is need in case of a problem or misunderstanding, take your time and revise your work and if you don't understand ask for help. The last and final skill, imagination. Imagination is needed to see the different perspectives of a problem and to imagine what your final product will look like. I use all of this skill in school. I work in group, more critical thinking goes on, patience when mistakes happens, and

I use my imagination to see our product or goal completed.

To participate in this program will be unreal, a dream become true. I have been in many different airplanes but never close enough to touch is hard metal and hear his engine roar like a lion from the outside. I would like to go visit your academy to look around and see in what you guys work on.

I would like to build, rebuild, inspects and work with imagination and patience with all of the people in the program. Would you make my wish come true.?          ",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,7.0,7.699645042419434,8
2A6C395EAC9A,"Schools with programs that offer students a way to graduate early are not as great as someone might think, and can lead to students having a hard time after they graduate. This may come up as a surprise to some because one would think that if you put the extra time and effort to graduate early that they may have the skills to succeed after high school, but that's simply not the case. In fact I encourage students like myself to think before going down a three year path before they start having second thoughts. In my case four years of high school will always be the best for any student due to these reasons: picking electives, no extra classes, and more time to think about the future.

To start off picking an elective can be a fun process that involves a student choosing a class that they might find interesting. This can be great for anyone who is trying to find something that they night enjoy doing or want to learn more about, and whats better then taking a course for free at high school, nothing. However some might argue that you can teach yourself or that a student could go to college for a better education. Well I disagree maybe that student does not have the time, the resources, or money, to make it worse you'll have to pay for the class at college. So if anything having that extra year can save you from making a terrible mistake.

Second reason why it's important to have that four years of high school it's simply just less work, think about it why would someone take extra classes or spend their summer taking a class or even take a class in the evening. The idea of this is ridiculous when their can be loads of other things a student can do with all of that time. Personally I would work over the summer, study in the evenings to prepare for my other classes or finish up work, or maybe I could enjoy that time to go out with friends or enjoy doing something like a hobby. Instead of overloading on school work and having a higher chance off failing due to the excessive work from all the classes that could even lead to stress.

Last reason for ever wanting a four year high school education is time, the chance to think about your future before heading out to the real world for the rest of your life. I can not stress this enough I have seen many student's lives ruined or just stuck for the simple reason of them not being able to think about their futures. Some student's that dont think about this when taking a three year route dont have an idea or clue about what they want to do in their lives, if they're financially stable, or if they have the opportunities to make it in the real world. There are jobs out there that require you to be at least eighteen years of age, and some of these students are just turning sixteen. Colleges require a large some of money, and families can't cover it all so students are forced to go into debt or drop out. Last one is just what if you don't know what you want to do, some students who graduate early just end up not doing anything for a whole year or two in most cases they give up on a better future for a job. That is why time is so important when thinking about your future.

Finishing up my response here all I can say is that if you have the option to graduate early don't just jump the gun. Instead think clearly if this is really what you want, and that you have a clear path after high school. The four years you get are very important, and should be taken advantage of with free courses in subjects you may like, less amount of work from extra classes, and that extra year of time to think about what to do after high school, That is why I support four years instead of three.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,10.0,8.120604515075684,8
BDF13939FA26,"Students may say inactivity is the way to go, However other student say keeping yourself occupied will lead you towards achievement. But staying occupied is the way to go if you wanna be successful and achieve things in life. Sitting around and doing nothing wont lead you to anything sucessful in life.

If your at home sitting around having nothing to do will not help you to be successful. If you try to find something productive to do it will help you in the future. To be productive or to do something productive really does'nt have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community.

Lets say you have home work but you dont feel like doing it, because your used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. which means you are more likely to procasanate. On the other hand if your used to doing your work the same day its assigned and or turn it in on time you are less likely to procasanate because you are used to staying occupied and doing all your work.

From my own expierence, when i was 14-15 years old i wouldnt do anything at home or at school which caused me to do negative things that didnt lead me to achieve my goals at that moment. Now that im 17 years old i keep myself busy by doing school work or working my part time job, which wont cause a negative effect on me because im preparing myself for my future and life goals.

12E3D52345C6,"Technology has always acted as a compelling and mysterious field for me. Even as a child, I spent countless hours not playing my video-game consoles as intended, but rather meticulously studying every component of the device in an attempt to crack the mystery on how it operated. Despite the fact that I've grown older and many aspects of my life have changed, my passion for technology has not only remained, but undoubtedly grown stronger as well. Therefore, an internship in this field seems vital in feeding and nurturing this passion. Although I have not had previous experience in shadowing, an opportunity to shadow would be fitting due to my previous experience and ever-growing passion in this field.

My experience in the technological field proves fitting for this opportunity to shadow. In school, I am enrolled in the Center for Information Technology at Generic_School. This specialty center provides me with crucial access to exclusive technology-based courses and teachers that help me broaden my vision in the technology field. Classes such as IT Project Management, Programming, and AP Computer Science Principles are all courses that I have been graciously provided with through the center and received exceptional results in. This daily involvement in technology not only increased my knowledge in this field, but also my curiosity on the subject. Outside of school, I am a member of the Technology Student Association, a club dedicated to assisting students nurture their interests through rigorous competitions. Through this club I have been able to surround myself with peers with similar interests and aspirations. This club has also provided me with opportunities to exhibit my knowledge in the technological field through competitions, receiving first place in States in Mass Production, Junior Solar Sprint, and Biotechnology. My involvement and superior results in these events prove to show not only my interest in this field, but my capabilities as well. These experiences transfer directly over to the internship, allowing for a smooth transition without much confusion.

The passion I have for technology undeniably proves me to be fitting for this internship opportunity. A crucial action that proves my strong interest in technology occurred when high school specialty center results were published. I was accepted into the medical, IB, and the information technology centers. Despite the fact that the majority of my close friends chose to enroll into the medical center, I stuck with my passion and enrolled into the Information Technology center. The action of choosing my interest over my close friends of many years displays how much I value technology and wish to pursue it in the future. In addition, my strong passion for technology can be displayed through the utilization of my free time. While other kids may choose to spend this time by indulging themselves into video games, much of my time is spent educating myself on technology. Many enjoyable hours of activities such as reading on the history of computers or watching videos on the future of technology were spent during this time. This use of my limited free time shows that technology, in my mind, is not a merely a class in school, but rather a hobby or an enjoyable subject. This attitude would no doubt have a beneficial effect for the internship.

In conclusion, the heavy interest and years of experience I have in technology proves me to be exceptional candidate for this shadowing opportunity. Although my work experience is limited, my passion and expierence in technology may help me ease into the internship without trouble. The talent I have in technology mixed with the catalyst that is my preexisting passion for this field helps me understand the importance of this internship. Not only will this internship assist in broadening my horizons on technology, but it will also help nurture and grow this passion into something meaningful and of use to the real world. Therefore, I believe this internship is perfect for me.                ",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,10.0,8.590482711791992,9

F99B20789DD7,"Dear Schoolboard,

I think that school should not be extended. students need to have a long break at home because they might have after school clubs to attend to.

I think students should not have extended school because they are not going to pay attention to the teacher they need to rest their brains for a long time since you are in school for 7 hours. Another reason why i think students should not have extra time at school is because kids have to wake up early and they are tired so they wont pay attention since they dont get enough sleep.

The other reason why i think school should not be extended is because the students most of them do not pay attention so typically the teacher is wasting her time trying to teach them. Also why i think they should not extend school is because if the day is longer they are going to need more breaks during the day and it takes a little long to go back in the building.

On the other hand i think they should have a extended school because they will know their subjects faster and that will make the school year faster. Another reason why i think they should extend school is because the students are really bored at home and they wish to learn instead of being home board. The last reason why

I think school should be extended is because kids might not pay attention during the day so with the extra hour they might want to pay attention and they will learn a little.

The last reason why i think school should be extended is because the students do things outside of home that are not good for them like doing challenges,steeling or getting into fights outside of school which can cause them injuries. The other reason i think they should extend school is because students would or will have a better education so that when they are grownups they will find a job that pays you more than the others.

These are the reasons why i think students should and should not have school extended i think they should extend school for a better education and i think they should not extend school because it is way too long",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,6.0,6.542555809020996,7

As young adults we constantly Chang are mind with everything we do at this young of an age. sometimes the job we go want in life is not the job we get when where full adults or maybe the job is not for you or not what you though it would be.

As small adults we still dont know what we are doing. we are the ages from 14-19 we are constantly changing are minds with everything we do, for example: sports, people we like and dislike, video games clothes pretty much everything. we also have a tendency to say thats what we want and be stubborn and when we start it we end up hating it.

Often times the job we been wanting is not even the job we get after college or high school . 87% of students who go to college and high school who come out with a degree dont even get the job in what they went to school for they go into a totally different type of work force.

71E7AE98D33A,"Expecting students to identify and commit to a career by the time they get to high school is a disaster and a recipe for failure.

it's not a flexible idea thats why I disagree with it,main reasons why I disagree with it are:age,growth,and influence.

Age:research shows that most students tend to start maturing when they're in high school. According to research,researchers say that most students coming from their old middle school to their new high school, tend to be poor at decision makings, because their brains are not yet fully developed;and because of this state of their undeveloped brain,most students are not capable of making life changing decisions or preparing their future because they are still just kids. For example:when I was just a kid and I dreamed of my favorite cereal brand almost every night so I said that I wanted to work for that cereal company. As I grow up that mentality changes because I'm maturing and which lead to me not wanting to do that career again, because I felt like it's just childish and I want to do a different career

Growth:As I said earlier students' brains are not yet fully developed and as they grow up their ideas and visions in life starts to change,their point of view at the world starts changing, their mindset start changing and starts becoming more realistic and because of all these things going on their mind and state of thinking starts becoming different. What they thought that they might have wanted to do when they were younger might start changing and they might not want to do it anymore, but because it's a requirement that they should have before coming to high school when they get there their mindset if already different but they can't go back now so they are stuck with that on career that they wanted to do when they were younger but might not want to do now. Example:Generic_Name wanted to work for his favorite cereal company but that was when he was younger, as he grows older he tend to fall in love with carpentry but he can't become a carpenter now because he already choose working for his favorite cereal company and that's the career he has to follow now by the school rules.

Influence:It''s once said ""if you grow up in the sky you learn how to fly and if you grow up under water you learn how to swim"". Students can easily get influenced from their surroundings,since their brains are not yet fully developed they tend to copy or follow the lifestyle of their surroundings. Living in a neighborhood or surrounding where everyone want to be a doctor makes the kids in that place want to be a doctor too because that's what they see everybody that they live next to, and all their friends want to be doctors so now you want to be a doctor too because of the lifestyle of your surroundings. Example:when I was growing up all the kids in my neighborhood including my friends and I all knew how to ride a bicycle, it was our thing. Everyday we rode bicycles doing races,stunts,and even to go to school we rode bicycles. All the kids around just love riding bicycles and we all wanted to become a bike pro. As we grow older everyone started maturing and we actually saw out potienals and started to get a glance about what we want to do in life when we grow up

Expecting students at that much of a young age to adopt responsibility to know what career they want is like telling a little toad to turn a frog instantly, which is impossible because the toad has to go through some stages before it can become a frog. This applies the same way to students, they cant just automatically grow up and know exactly what career they want to follow they have to go through stages to see if it's truly what they want. Some students might say that they know what career they want to follow but in fact according to research,researchers say that only three out of ten student know what career they want to do before entering high school. The rest are still indecisive about what career they wan to.

As to what I started with, students moving into high school are just too young to know what they want career they want to follow when they grow up. All of these reasons and examples I stated are the obligations to why I say that I disagree with societies that expect their students to identify a career by the time they get to high school.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,7.0,7.962550163269043,8
F069420C6DB7,"Some schools are offering distance learning for students to attend class from home. With online or video conferencing . I support thus idea of distance classes Because you can wake up anytime you want, Go in a slow speed to no overwhelm yourself, no one can bother you while you study.

First of you can wake up anytime you want so you can have the right amount of hours in case you work at night and you dont get seven to nine hours of sleep every night. Also you can do classes later in the day in case you want to work in the morning instead of the night. So you can have a career and have time to study to make your future come closer. It's also a good thing for people that have to stay home to look at after their sick parents or little brothers they won't have to worry at school if they are okay because they will be home taking classes and making sure everything is okay while studying.

Therefore they won't be overwhelmed about missing days or which classes he needs to make up a test or if he/she has a project coming up in class because all of that info is going to be in his/her phone or laptop. Its a better thing to have online classes doesn't take up half of your day you dont get overwhelmed with new info for like 4 different classes in one day. So you wont be stressed out as much that (study shows most kids that drop out is because they are being stressed out with so many info in just one day for like 4 different blocks in a single day). Online classes are better from what i heard it help's you better cause it teaches you what the state want's you to know instead of things you dont need to know like some side stories that teachers say to make you try to remember but end up getting lost in the story.

Finally when you do your work no one can bother you about the answer or what problem you in and they cant cheat off of you and you end up getting in trouble because they didnt stop asking or taking to you. Its also a good thing because if you don't understand you can go back a lesson to relearn it again in case you forgot how to do the problem. thats why Online classes are more proffered then actual class when you have to wake up early and go to school all tired cause you only slept a little staying up because of work or studding for the next unit so you cant fall behind or re doing a new untie while going into a new one. So i support the idea of distance learning for students and that schools are thinking about doing it would be a great idea.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,7.0,6.478234767913818,6

One of the benefits is that the students can wake up late, because the class is online so, you can take the class in the afternoon, you can stay in your home relax in the bed also if you want eate you can do.

Some guys work in the morning, in the night or all the day.

I have a friend that he work of

8am to 5pm and he always is tired and this can help his, for the future.

He can study in the night and have his class with tranquillity.

Some people think that this a way to lose the time, but I do't think so.

Because I believe that you can be a profesional person if you want.

My friend don,t wanna work in a restauran all the time, he want to be a mechanic and if he take class online his dream can be convert a reality.

EBD586EB3AA8,"Schools should not have a four day school because, some students may not have time to stay more hours, some students have a part-time job and others help parents to taking care of younger siblings. However, some people have different points of view by, believing that extending schools days that benefits the energy, resources and even helping students to learnd more. An example, is just having four days work or school week. This adaptation can have good and bad benefits. Some people believe that, havig just four days of school is a bad idea because a student will not have time to work or do other activities. A reason of this is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parents taking care of their siblings.

One of a major idea is students will not have time to do their activities. Since school is going to end late. Students need to finish all school assignments. However, Elementary schools will end later that High schools or Middle schools. That will not letf them much longer for them to pass time with their family. Students will be more eshausted, that can be really worrying because their grades can go down. Parents will not be happy with their kids grades. This adaptation can be really helpfult for some people. However, it can affect some other people lifes.

Another reason is some students have a part-time job. They will no have time to work and even if, they have the time it's going to be difficult for them. An example, if students get out from school late they have to run to their house to get ready to go work because they may be late for work. However, going to work for them is not that easy some of them don't have their license yet. Some of them have to walk even take a public bus. Before considering the benefits of four days of school week there are a lot more disadvantages that can affect students with their normal life.

The last reason is teenagers helps parents with their siblings. Although that can change because if students have to stay more at school their schedules will be longer than a normal. An example, parents will have to find someone that can stay with their kids and that means that is going to be more cost. Parents will be unhappy paying more money to a babysitter. However, is reallly hard to find someone that can be dependable. Even if teenegers have the time to take care of their siblings, they will not have time to do their own stuff because they have to do two things at the same time.

In conclusion, these ten hours school not just affect students will affect the whole family because students will end really eshausted even, teachers will get tired too. After considering all the benefits and disadvantages there is a point about conserve energy and resources that does not make sense, if students get two more hours of school for four day that means that there is not any conserve anergy or resources because we still using the same five days hours in four days instead five days. Reasons why students should not have four day week is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parent taking care of their siblings.",3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,7.0,6.306652545928955,6

DA86BC9B9FB6,"I think is a good choice for people to take classes online or at home because they can learn more and concentrate better and put more attention and nobody can distract them. I think if people do it online or at home they are not going to make friends. Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and don't be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn.

some people prefer to take classes from home or online. because they can be more concentrate without nobody distracting them. I think it will be a good choice for them to do it online. For example if they are doing work in a group they are talking and don't concentrated but if they are with nobody they can work better and do their work. This can be the reason for more people take that classes because they work better with out no one else. The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail. But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that.

When the school is over at the end of the year some people learn a lot but some people no because they were just playing and don't putting attention or sleeping in class. But the people who studies online or at home they are ready know a lot because they were concentrated and no one was distracting them and that if how they work someones want to learn and pass and someones no each one can take their own decision. I think studies online is more better, more productive at the and of the year. Taking classes at home can benefit at the students in many ways and they know more at the end of the school. When the students at the regular school at the end of the year they have an SOL test. some students fail this test because they did not learn nothing for the rest of the year just for be sitting and doing nothing. But if someone who studies at home have the ability to pass the SOL because they were interested of the class of what were they learning and don't have distractions all year.

7B6211B17CAC,"Imagen being stressed out by too much school work. For some reasons,so many parents think that having their children getting graduated in 3

years from high school is better than the normal four school years. But I think that it is not helpfull for teen-ager being over responsible with too much homework or having them to take extra clases in the summer because a lot of this guys might be willing to have a job after school,play sports or participate in school activities.

First,a lot of students would like to have a job after school as a joby or to make some money to help themselves with college stuff, and a lot of times they do not have the option or permition of their parents to have a job;I think that having a job as teen-ager would be helpfull to develop your skills and to see for your own eyes what did want to work on in your future to see what you really want in life ,but sometimes parents want to provide everything not knowing that they are not going to be there forever to help them;they must let them go and try somthing new in life,so that they can take their own responsabilities too.

Secondly,in so many ocationes as students we want to play sports after school but sometimes we can not play because there is always a lot of homework,and our parents want us to have done our homework first in order to go out with our friends to play;That is the reason why i think that getting gradduate in 3 years is not helpfull mentally not even physically because we need to exercise our mind and our body, but sometimes our parents they do not understand that and we fall in depression which is even worse for us because we do bad at school and our behavier change in a bad way.

Third, as teen-agers we want to be involved in school activities and have fun with our friends and teachers at school but sadly a lot of times it looks to be impossible because we are either taking classes online or dealing with our homework and trying to figure it out how to make it work, but many times it just turn impossible for us to make a space to participate in clubs at school because of homework or stuuf that our parents want us to do ,but there is going be a day where our parents are going to see that having us doing too much school work was not the best idea that they ever had for us.

In conlusion,I learned that too much schools work could stress you out and having you to fall into depression or having bad grades at school beacuse you can afford all this homework or clases on your own and also as teen-agers we need our free time to play and do our own activitiies. If it were up to me , I would rather have kids taking 6 classes a year in a period of four years.    ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,8.0,6.101670265197754,6

EB5924FBD25C,"Although some say schools shouldn't extend the school day two hours because some students and teachers might have work after school, actually schools should extend the school day two hours because students get enough time to do their assignments and home works also teachers got enough time to check students work properly and students can add one more subject.

Some people say that schools shouldn't extend the school day two hours because some students and teachers might have work after school. But if we see that in another way instead of working after school sixteen hours with in four days we can just work eight hours in our three days weekend. also it is wast energy for instance, there is one student who works after school for three days until 5:00 pm - 11:00 pm. He came at school by 3:30 pm and he works at seven eleven which is the hardest place to work. It takes 15 minute to go and he have to at 4:45 pm to reach his destination on time. And then let's see after work he gets home at 11:00pm then he sleeps at 12:00 am. How can he focus on he's classes? this person is losing 2 things;

1, losing energy

2, not focusing on his classes he might fail the classes that he is taking

The student that wants to extend the school day will have enough time to do their assignments and home works, also teachers get more time to check the students work properly because they probably got 3 days off if is there any meeting or doing some things in school for example, if the government decide there is a meeting every Friday. However, it is better for teachers to do their work as an example they can check students work on one day of their breaks and they can relax, hangout, playing with kids etc. Students also can do what every they want if we see one example, one student can finish his assignments and other school stuffs in one whole day and the rest of the the weekend is his he gets enough time if he get enough time then he is free from school for two days if he continue work on it he got 2 days free every weeks. In addition those who needs long time to study this schedule can help the students that who wants more time work on it.

Learning is gaining knowledge, so that in these schedule students can add one more subject. How ever, based on this idea two argument comes from the students who wants to add extra class and the students who wants to extend the normal class by adding one hour for each classes.

Adding one hour for each classes is better to have the experience to sit for two hours and 30 minute in one class. And also it's good to work long time on one subject, but as we see in high school student this idea is trash. It can work for only in college class based on that the college students said that ""one man trash is another man's treasure"". When I come with my idea students can add one more subject because it is Better to get credit on that class and students can choose 3 or more elective classes . For example one student wants to take 3 classes that he have to take and pass for graduate high school he wants to learn 2 classes that helps him in the future. In Virginia law you have to take English 12 and Maths classes. Also to graduate high school it require Personal and Financial Economics to take it. those 3 classes are History, Biology, and one elective class to get a full credit. If the school can only learn 7 subjects this student is going to add another 1 year to learn only one class.

Finally Schools should extend the school day two hours because students get more time to do things that they have to do and it also useful for teachers they can get enough days off. Also teachers work harder than students, so that teachers work 4 days and 3 days off. And Students can add one class to get more credit.                                                                                 ",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,7.0,6.340482711791992,6
655BD307F87D,"Many students in high school are looking for the way to reduce their time in school, there are several reason for students to think about it. These students might be passing through hard situatons, such as: economical crisis, issues at home, need of independence or any other problems that is not allowing them to be in school the time they should be in, but some people do not need a short period in high school because of they are struggling, this group of people might want go to college earlier or get a job as soon as possible for personal reason.

In the United States, we live everyday a situation call ""migration"", this type of situation make people to leave their countries for some valid reason, regardless the issues they will have coming into the country. In fact many of this people is looking a better life here, the life they could not have in their countries because of their governments, scarcity of resources, scarcity of jobs, low wages, dangerous areas and many others situations that nobody would like to live. Between this group of people we can find students that were in school in their countries, but when they come into this country and they get in high school, as a result of the ""bad"" education from certain countries, these students are settled in grades where they should not be because of their age and learning capacity. This is one of the main reasons why high schools and the departament of education should have programs where this group of students can find better opportunities of learning without changing the time they should be in school.

In another point of view, for school districs to offer this type of programs, the country will get benefits because of the students will get in college earlier and we are going to get a lot of professional people that can help to improve our nation.

Economy will be a good reason to want get out of high school one year early, this is because many people do not count with the amount of money that is needed to go to college, many students prefer to work to make money for their payments instead of getting financial help from the bank that they will have to pay with higher interest in the future. Other students think about the possibility to go to college out of the country because of the high cost of them, but they still have to work and get extra money.

The departament of education of the United States is encharge for all these changes and they should take this option because it would benefit people, would benefit the country, and will benefit students in general.

The program could work if students stay after school or they come at night, this would give them more opportunities to make a plan where they can work hard to reduce their time in high school, it is really important to keep on mind that many students already work in their free time and they might not be able to do an extra time in high school, that is why this offer should be analyzed in order to the student benefit, but at the same time giving the enough amount of knowledge they will need.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.0,8.0,6.71095085144043,7

2DAF1DDAB6FF,"We are living in a world where's everyone likes to hit them self just to look cool in their community. I agree to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment because do what's makes you happy and accept yourself.

First of all, do what's makes you happy. For example every time I tell my mom I want to became a flight attendance, she says that flight attendance is not a good career for me just because she wants me to be a nurse. Even tho, I know my mom doesn't like it my career I will still do it and convince her because this career is something that I call passion . I don't see the point of trying to pleasure people if you not happy with yourself and you not being yourself that's may be kind of frustrated. Furthermore, being yourself is being honesty with people around you. Keep yourself and people will admire and respect you just the way you are.

Second, accept yourself. For example, I have seeing Muslims girls in my school that since they came to America, their live change too( the way they how they dressing and acting) because of something that people call influence. I don't believe in influence i believe that people have the right to make their own chooses. No matter how hard it, no matter what people will say because people always have something to say to make you feel bad even when you are doing fine. Be yourself is the greatest accomplishment.

Some people say sometimes you have to be someone else to be in the same level as the people around you. But do you really have to be in the same level as the people around you? I don't think so because everyone is different, by the time you doing what makes you happy instead of make people happy is the a great accomplished. Therefore, be yourself brings real people in your life such people who really appreciate the way you are.

In conclusion, I strongly agree that be yourself in the a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, because you are doing what makes you happy and accept yourself. It's kind of hard to keep yourself but it's not impossible.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,6.0,6.215573787689209,6
F58DF8739B42,"Dear Mr. Principal today I want to talk abot how most employees are looking for a specific characteristics in potential employee even if they don't know the job. I agree with this prompt because a person not always know how to do a job, but they can learn.

Some people when they are new on a job they don't really know what to do, they have to be trainig for another person that alredy know the job like a manager, maybe employees are looking for a manager, the person they contract to be the manager maybe her/ him don't have the experience at all, but they can learn over the time they are working. For example when I came to this country I start to work with my stepfahter to put ruffin, I didn't know how to do the job, bit I learn over the time that I work with him. Last summer I was working on a restaurant like a cashier and I had a problem because I didn't know the differences on the coins because in my country it was really different, but I learn a lot because the manager from the restaurant help me to be succesful on the job, and I put a lot of eargerness to leanr the job.

A lot of people when they know the job they like to work hard becuase they want to learn more about it, some people that alreayd know the job they can learn new things about the job from another employee or manager. A lot of people here in United States work hard for the benefits of their family not just for a benefit to be hired, They know that if they work hard their childrens can leanr abot their experience, and they can be a better person, a lot of parents like to be a example for their childrens, so the way their childrens know that work hard is something that you need to be proud of. Some of them work hard to achieve their goals, or to have a better future.

However, be responsable is another important thing that you need to keep in mind, be responsable can help you to get hired on the job, if you are responsable the main boss are going to see that they need people that are responsable to be more succesful. A lot of companies grow up because their employee are responsable, and they complete all the activities their boss ask them to do. When I was in my country a lot of people tried to put like a store, but it never work because the people they put to work they didn't show up on time, and they weren't responsale on their activities, and the store had to close because they didn't improve what they want to do. Be responsable is one thing that is going to help you to be succesful in life becuase if you are new to a job and you show up on time they are going to see that you are really responsable with your activities and that's what most of the jobs are looking for people how are responsable.

Another thing that employers need to know that they have to contract a person that is going to have patient, in every job they have a manager and employers should know if the manager have the patient to be training people that is new on the jop. Lets do a example some managers are impatient they don't like to help people that don't know the job because they said that they don't have the time to be training people because they think that the person is never going to learn how to do the job, or they have another important activitie to do instead of be training a new person. In a lot of restaurants or stores the managers are always with good actitude and they like to help people.

In my conclusion I would say that a employee don't have to know how to do a job if they are responsable and they like the job him/her are going to learn what they need to do to be succesful on the job. Another thing is that you don't born with experiences you need to learn from the callenges life give to you and you can learn from your mistakes.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,6.0,5.443385124206543,5

Friday my teacher told me that I passed the test, I was so exciting that my positive attitude that I was going to pass the test, helped me to reach my goal. I know that the key to success in life, is to have a positive attitude to accomplish the goals that people setup.

Also having positive attitude make people to have excellent thoughts because in my English class my classmates and I, we were making a assignment to write about our own a poem. One of my classmates came with an idea to write about Roses in Pain. Everyone agree about the idea, so each of us wrote something different, then we compared all the ideas that we wrote and make it in one. We did the poem and I came with a positive attitude, I told them it was going to look better if we would do it romantic. The group agree and we did it the romantic way, it was about a man called Jonas and a woman called Maria, that they could not fall in love because her mother was rich and she could not let Jones married him, because he was poor. Our teacher told us that it was great and he liked it, and that we have a good attitude to do anything and accomplish. Our excellent thoughts came in way with positive attitude and it worked, because we did and we got A+ in our assignment. Working in groups and sharing thoughts, having that positive attitude and help others to improve their positive attitude too and have excellent thoughts. Some people may say that in life people just have to go straight to get on the top the hill, because they are going to have success in life quickly. To accomplish success in life first of all, people have to take step by step, have a positive attitude and take things with calm not with promptness. Thus, the key to success in life is to have positive attitude always, to accomplish goals, and have excellent thoughts.

For example, students have to graduate to be finished with highschool and to get there diploma. Students go to school everday so that they can achieve there goals on graduating so that they can get good jobs, good money, and also to get accepted in to Universitys or Colleges. Thomas Jefferson wrote this quote so that the people can understand that if you put anything into your mind, you can achieve it and you can make something out of it because at the end of the day hard work pays off and it is better then no work. Also, It dosen't matter how long you take or how little you take, it is still about the amount of effort someone puts if we are always doing something. Another example would be, Thomas Jefferson always did something random and he would make the best out of it. Inactivity in my opinion dosen't serve a purpose because inactivity isn't something that can help you accomplish more because you really are not doing anything. Finally, accomplishing goals in your life is a big deal for the future for you and your family. These goals will help you become the person who you really wanna become and it wants you to inspire others that they also can be like you if they set there mind and intetions on to what they are doing. In conclusion, not everyone is the same and not everyone is gonna get there as fast as others because everyone has obsticles in there life and it my slow them do but it is probably for the better and maybe thre guardian angel is sending them a sign that they don't need to rush anything because you can watch your mistakes, focus on other things, and most importanly is to focus on your family.

0757FE18DBAA,"In my opinion I think is a good idea to change the menu from the school beacuse some students don't like the school food I think tha'ts why the student skiping clases beacuse they go and buy some food beacuse they don't like the school food.

First: Many student think the school lunch taste bad, and they either don't buy it,or they throw it away with the groing problem of overweigh kids. The school needs to make a new lunch menu with healthier tastier options. I think the school should consider an option that will be tasty,healthy.

Second: changing the lunch nenu is an important change because estudent will be healthier. Around the world a lot of people have a problem of eating right in this will be helpfulfor student. Eating healthy make student realize that it's the rigth choice in this will impact their lives in good way. for example in my country the give to as different food kinf of food every day and here they give the same food.

Finally:changing the lunch menu is one of the most important changes the school should make because lunch should be healthier and longer so estudents would have more energy throught the day to pay attention and learn.

Also , student will be influence to eat healthier and the school will have more money because people would actually buy the food. so changing the lunch menu will be good for everyone.

In my conclusion I think that the principal have to change the lunch menu because is very important to the students who don't like the food, and also for the teenagers how skip the clases. Is important to have healthier food that's is good for every one and for the school. Also for the heath of the kids because many kids have obesity principal change the menu from the school and put health food.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,5.0,5.1757893562316895,5
20CF9410DC4A,"Is a good or bad idea to choose a carrer being young?

To begin, in my opinion choose a career being a young student is a good idea because it is a great opportunity for them. Imagine people can choose their profession since their youthness. For example, if they think that they want to be a doctor and at that moment they do not like that profession, they can opt for other career on time. Also, taking that decision many people assure their future, for example if they know what to do when they come to the adult stage, they going to be successful because they going to learn many things since young, and that helps to get better their knowledge. Therefore, doing careers help to people to keep their mind busy in their careers and studying hard and using their time to do good things, like do not using drug or wasting their time being a vandal. As well, if all the people do it, the world will be a place full of privilege, with porfessional people around, having trust and support on each other.

To conclude, doing career is one of many opportunities that we have in this country, so we have to use it, because it help us to be good person and get better our skills to be a professional. Furthermore, we have to learn how to focus in really important things. Also, it teach us how to become a successful human and fight for our goals since young. As well, it is good to learn how to be a independant person because if you study hard, your future will be full of success, so you do not need other people to do anything you want.

CB769FAD1A51,"There are many enjoyable and educational activities out there ,but if i had to pick one it would be playing an instrument because its really interesting, its part of music and it helps some people make their carriers in music.

Playing a guitar is not an easy task, it takes lots of practice and time to master it, its challenging and its just so interesting because of the way it produces sound, theres a whole lot of science in the instruments. some people think its useless but its actually a little bit related to science, because we learn about sound waves, sounds , and how sounds are produced, in science.

Who doesn't like music? I mean 98% of people do, in my opinion, playing an instrument is related to music and people love music, so do people love playing instruments. Instruments are a huge part of music, Since, I was 5 years old I always wanted to play an instrument. One day my older cousin bought a guitar and played it , I got inspired by her.

Playing an instrument and being good at it can be beneficial in making carriers too. You can become one of the band members that perform, or you can write your own songs and make your own music videos and tracks. If you are successful in making your carrier you can have carriers that a lot of people want like a singer or a band member like Maroon 5.

Playing an instrument is so much more exciting than people think it is, playing instrument is one of my favorite hobbies and activities to do when I am free. I am taking guitar as an elective in High school, hopefully i will get it.          ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.0,8.0,7.0938944816589355,7
293A93F037A7,"I agree with Winston Churchhill because without failure how can we be succesfull in life. Frist, reason why because If you fail at something you can reflect on it. Second, failure can make you become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. Third, Is never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success.

You can always reflect on somthing you fail at, and become better. If, you don't study yourself at something you failed at, then you can't become successfull. For example, say you were playing a football game, and you missed your tackle in the game. After the game you watch the film, and see what mistakes you did wrong. After you seen what was wrong in film. You studied the film, and trian harder in practice for next game, so that won't happen again. Another reason you can do after you reflect on yourslef is practicing at something you love to do. For example, riding a bike for the frist time without trianing wheels. If you fail at riding a bike, then you have to practice, so you can become better at it. In order to practice you have to reflect on it frist. After you reflect what you did wrong, then you will become better when you practice.

Failure can teach you to become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. For example, you went to practice for a 100 meter, but you did not wram up at all. You decided to run the 100 meter for the frist time anyway. After you finsh the 100 meter you didn't feel good about the time you had. The next day you decide to warm up, and work harder to get better results. After your trianing you wanted to run a 100 meter. When you ran a 100 meter you felt better with your time, and decided to work harder everyday to become better then you were yesterday. This is how failure is making you better because it is teaching you that if you fail at something, you can always pick it back up, and become better, then what you were doing that day when you failed at something. If you want to become better, then you were yesterday. Then don't worry about the past because thinking about it all the time will bring you back to failure. For example, say you are mad that you lost your 100 meter race in fourth place. When you lost, you keep thinking about it all the time, and can't move forward for the next race. When the next race starts the day after you lost. You lost the race again in fourth place because you keep thinking about the race you lost in the past, then thinking about how can you can become better then you were yesterday. The point is in order to become better you have to think how can you improve better for the future, then thinking about how you failed in the past.

Never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. For example, say you have a math test on Monday, but you decide on Sunday to not study for it because you think the test is very easy. On Monday you give up on a math test, and decide to fail it. The reason why because you did not study, and it was too hard for you. You decide to retake it on tuesday, and learn from your mistakes. On Tuesday after you failed the math test. You took the test again to get a better score because you studied very hard to succesed in the test. This is why you always use failure to lead you to success. If you let failure consume you, then you won't reach to the top to become successful. For example, you can't swim at all, and your drowing. For some reason you dont won't to reach the top because you are depressed, and want to give up.

In conclusion, I still believe It is impossible to be succesfull without failure. Without failure we cannot reach the top to be successful. Without failure we cannot reflect on things to become better. Without failure we cannot become better then yesterday. In order to become successful we have to use failure to lead us to success. Its okay to fail because after you learn from it. Everything is going to be okay when you overcome it, and be better. ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.5,7.0,6.28843879699707,6
059FB5798AD7,"The school don't have to follow the this model by two hours that not gonna work if they put only two day per week and two hours. If they put ten hours is gonna be stressful but they have to pay well, two hours we can not learn everything in two hours we have seven classes in one day how we can learn everything in two, hours an then we have test everybody is gonna get zero, because to have a good job we have to study a lot we have to go to college but if they have to the opportunity because some of the students they don' have the opportunity we don't have all the money to pay college or we don't have papers like to go a good college an make our dream like me i wanna be police but i don't have paper is very difficult for us because we can not have a good job only we can do is finish high school and find another job. for example if i find a job and they pay me seven dollar per hour and i have to pay a lot thing like rent, bills, help my family almost all Spanish have like two or three job because we have to pay a lot of thing and they did go to the school in our countries years ago it was not easy to go the school like my mom she only can do is 3th grade but it not only her in my country many people have the same case, she don't have a god job here but she work everyday that why i try everything to be good student because she did have the chance to go to the school and i have that chance to learn but if they put only two hours to come to the school, is better to find another job because an two hours ca not learn to be ready for what we want to be, but if they put like we have to for two hour how much they gonna pay for the teacher that not may sense. In two hours how many classes they can teach one? but we want to have our diplomas that the most important without the diploma is gonna be more difficult to find a job or see if we can go to college they have to think careful is they wanna put only two hour in my opinion this not gonna work they have to think a lot for the student we came to here we have to learn another language. I have one idea if they want to put ten hours for work per day they have to pay well and we can study five hours is not the sufficient but is better than nothing. you know what we can do we can work for day and we can go to the school all day when we have off if you want to make money same time you study you can take only class if the school say yes about that businesses to adopted like that when we have time we can do like that take classes only in my opinion i don't want to come to the school only per two hours i don't want to loss my time if i can do the same in my my house if they give to me the chance to speak for everybody, first i have to talk about my ideas then i can make a decision before i tell everybody what we can do, but we have to see not everybody like to work some of the people they like to ask for many to his parent that not fear for our pares because we are young we can work and make some money to help our family not always our parent can buy everything for as, i always think in my family when i get my pay check because sometimes we don't have a lot of money but we have family we can help each other, always the studies is first that my mom telling me every single day because i have day i don't want to come to the school but i'm thinking a bout my dream to be police in this country not in my because they not follow the ruler, we have to star down letter we can have better position we have to effort to they can give us the position.

A lot of people have a chance to study and they don't care about that a lot of people want to study here to learn English but they do not have the chance, maybe my ideas don't have sense about the two hours but if they approve i'm not coming and i go to work and pay maybe twenty five dollar per class, if they pay well i can buy everything i want for example the thing i dont have is car,my own house, buy all the thing my family needed find job for my sisters or we can have our on company, all my sisters and brother are young but if i have that job ten hour per day i will pay the school for my sisters they can be prepare to get the diploma and make the're dream i love my family if i have everything in ma hands i will do it to make their dream it not easy but with GOD we can make it but they have to study all day not two hours, by extending the school that way hey have to have ideas what we have to do to make our dream possible because some people we canto to go college and see if we can study more but with two classes they will say no you don't have all requisites to be here in this college they gonna make another college for the students study here and only study two hours, they don't know nothing about math maybe or other classes maybe they gonna give us everything easy to go college or give as all credits we need, because if you want to have a good job where they pay good they gonna ask you if you have a diploma if i say no do you think they gonna give me the job? exactly they gonna say no you need to have your diploma in that time will be late because i will not have the job and i did get my diploma, for one size is good but for the other size is not good we not learning nothing and i know a lot of us like money but same time we want to have our diploma this is my last year and i want my diploma, my next is make my dream to be police, if i only come for two hour i will be fairway from my dream.

CA0FB6DB7B80,"I agree, with our school principal ideas, I agree that our school principal should add more afterschool activities or even better, in school activities, I also agree that all students, in Generic_School, should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I think that after a long day of school, after a log day of studying hard and working hard, our principal should let students do an activity after school, such as sports, serving as a student council, and working on year books to unstress ourselves out. In my case I love playing sports so much, my biggest favorite sport is soccer, and I love it!! I think it would be woderful that our school principal decides to add a soccer activity afterschool, even tho you can run, get tired, and sweat alot by playing soccer. Soccer could be one of the best way to workout your muscles and body. And not just that, it could be one of the best ways to developed your brain, and the best way to give your brain a break from school things, such as math, science, art, mucic,civics,english,strings,etc.

As I said before, it's a great idea to have afterschool activies or in school activities. ""wow"". what a great way to unstress yourselves out after a long and tired day of school. Lately, most people, and student's stay after school to do an activity, but not all of the students participate in at least one activity after school or in school, some don't participate because they're parent's don't give them permission to stay after school, for at least 2 hours.

I think that parents, should give permission to their kids to stay afterschool and participate in at least one activity. It will be awesome that all students participate in an activity, even if you don't know how to play a sport or any other activities, you can learn as time goes through, you can learn by looking at other student's examples, over ad over and over again! yet I think that adding after school or in school activities, is a good way to get to know other students from different grade levels or further more, get to know different teacher's in our school, that we don't talk to, or don't get along with. By joining in afterschool or in school activities you can easily get along with other people, and who knows you can become friends or even better best friends.

As some people do this activities or play sports, others can volunteer to help in school, in whatever teacher's need help in. For example, others could work on keeping the school clean.

furthermore instead of having just sports activities, we should, or in other words the principal should decide to add more new school activities, like I said helping in school. My question is how can I help in school? well you can help in school for example,by helping the school clean. but in what ways ca I keep school clean? well one example is by keeping the school organized and neat. while other students could do other things, for example, students could participate in picking up trash that other student live during school hours.

Others can participate in keeping things organized in school such as keeping the library clean, by organizing the books by categories or by the authors, this way all students could colaborate to keep our school clean. Students should be able to colaborate in at least one thing, that way if all students colaborate and volunteer in this great idea, our school will look more organized and wonderful, not just from the outside, but from the inside too, because that way visitors or even our parent's who come to school sometimes, can notice how great our school looks like, because how our school looks like, tells other people alot about our school.

Students in our school are so helpful, as teacher's are too, our school has alot of wonderful, helpful and smart students. In my opinion I think that teachers or students cannot change the whole world, but we can change at least our school. We can make our school in to a better school, in to a a wonderful and nice school, even tho others made not like the idea of having extracurricular activities. Indo think we should have extracurricular activities,afterschool. Sometimes after a long day of school, I go home tired and bored. In my opinion that's why we should do afterschool or inschool activities, so when school ends, we can go home happy and not tired. As I said before, sports is a good way to end school and go home happy. All activities, doesn't matter if is in school or afterschool can help you alot, it entertains you and helps you take a break from school. When school ends, some people are bored, tired, sleepy, mad, sad, depressed, etc, but if our school principal adds new activities after or in school, those students that are sad, mad, depressed or tired after school, can go home happy and with a positive attitude.

Overall, in conclusion I do agree with our school principal's idea. I think teacher's and parent's should vote too, so we can have more new activities, so we can have in school or after school activities. Lets help our school! students!! Let's help teacher's and our principal decide, that way we will have new activities to do, in school and afterschool. Let's keep our school clean, beautiful, organized and a safe place to be in. Let's help our school look awesome, so when visitors come, or our parent's come to visit our school, they can say positive things and not negative things about our school. Let's be the awesome students we have always being, and I encourage you to join in our after school activities, that way we can always be happy and have a positive attitude.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,7.138491630554199,7

Examples:

1. Some people are influenced by friends

2. Everyone has their own life traits

3. Not everyone has bad traits

I believe everyone in this world has their own choice of traits but, their are some other people who are influenced by others which include, Friends,family, even people who don't know you well and dosen't wanna see you succeed and can hold you back your traits. But therefor there's people who follow their own good traits witch will lead you to a better and a successful life. Last but not least not everyone has bad traits some people will have a good influence on you witch could be good deed and take you the right way it all depends on you how you well your mind process to find out if its bad or good for your life.

1. I believe everyone in this world had their own trait of living some have good deed but some negative for example, bad traits can come from friends, family, even people not close to you i believe that because not everyone is raised with a happy living families which lead them to a bad trait of how they grew up but, on the other hand some are raised with a happy family which gave that person a good deed of living with good traits but again that could be ruin for you if you spending time with someone with bad traits.

2. Therefore everyone in the world has their own trait for Example people with success in life having big beautiful house and expansive cars had good traits which have lead them to a better life for the next generation but on the other hand bad traits will lead you to nothing but a bad life and negative traits and if you become friends with them and you had good trait you are being influenced and controlled by someone else, Some other traits can come from your relationships like if you have a girlfriend thats the worst influence that could change everything in your life and some can break you apart mentally but some can take you the right way examples of a bad relationship arguments,blaming yourself,hurting each other with actions. that could leave you with a scar you can't heal from and can bring bad traits for your future.

3. Last but not least not everyone is controlled and influenced by others because for example smart people, people will try to put you on negative deeds if you have a successful life they will hate and will try anything to take you off your path don't let any bad influence get to them and understand the fact they are trying to ruin your life, you have to step up for yourself and stay away from the bad influence that could control you and lead you a negative path my advise for the people who feel like they are being influenced and are controlled what you choose your character to be thats how your gonna be and how your gonna live so think to yourself and say what your traits are a negative or a positive.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,6.0,5.836328506469727,6

If some one don't chouse their future and they don't care about then they may have lot's of problem and that time that person can't do nothing. so we have to determine each part of our live and and we have to do more focuse of oure futuure and always be a accomplish person, to get our goal's on easy way.

20A4E74DE0C3,"Students have the option to attend classes from home that some schools offer them. It's important for students to get a good education whether they get it from attending to school or online. Schools must focus on some ways students can be benefited from learning. Schools should not offer students options to attend classes from home because students will not take their education seriously, they will be distracted from many things, and they will not learn efficiently.

Many students don't take their lives seriously, especially their education. This school option will make students not to complete their tasks on time. Because they will not have an adult telling them that they need to complete, they will take their education less serious. They will not see education as an important thing. It's likely that they would be slacking around at home, because teachers will not be there to tell them what to do.

There are many things students can be distracted from. Any device, for example, can be a distraction for students. A phone can be a problem for them. It's a distraction that can stop them from learning. There are high chances students would be texting with someone and using social media when taking classes online. They would also be going out too much, leading them to forget that they have classes to take online. At home, they would feel tired and bored because they won't even have any social interaction. They would go out more often and would it would lead them to be distracted every time they go out.

Education is important, but taking classes online will not make students to learn efficiently. They need teachers to guide and tell them what to do. If they don't have a teacher to tell them what to do or how to do it, they will end up confused, not knowing what to do next. They will not be learning anything because they will not understand what they're doing. Their knowledge will decrease due to the lack of learning.

Although some people may say that attending classes at home is good, they are not correct. Taking classes online does not benefit students from learning. In fact, it makes them less productive. They will not have idea of what is going on. Attending classes online is not the best way for students to learn.     ",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,7.0,8.633169174194336,9

Another reason is what he/she could their character trait learn to know what is best for them.

For example: When a person does not know the difference of what is best and how they can learn from to not knowing, he/she can know what they need to focus or work on.

A7ED341B576D,"Is taking career courses a good idea for students? Some people believe that taking career courses is a good idea for students. Other people believe that taking career courses is not a good idea for students. This is important because career courses can effect life of students. Taking career courses is a good idea for students because career courses help student to find their future job, improve their skills, and help economy of a country.

First,taking career courses help students to find which job they like to have in the future. Career courses show ability of students. Career courses impact at decision of students. For example, a student take nursing class in high school. When she take a nursing class, she will decide that have this job in the future. After graduating from high school, she will chose nursing in college because she already has information about nursing. Career courses are useful for students . Thus, if students want to find their favorite job, they should take career courses.

Additionally, career courses help students to improve their skills because with taking career courses students will learn new information. To illustrate, a student take computer class in high school, and she will learn new information about computer. She will have ability to fix a computer's problem, and she can make money with fixing a computer's problem. Career courses will improve knowledge of students. They can have a best job in the future. Thus, If students want to learn new information, they should take career courses.

However, not everyone is agrees with this position. Some people claim that taking career courses is not a good idea for students because interest and opinion of students will change. All people in this world are not the same mood and opinion everyday. Interest of students with learning new information will change. For example, a student take army class in high school because he wants to this job in future. After a month he interests to be a doctor in future, he will not like army anymore ,and he just waste his time in army class. Nevertheless, the opposition overlooks an important point, namely that taking career courses is a good idea for students because career courses will improve economy of a country . A country will have a good economy because a community is full of smart students. They make future of a country. For example, a student take economy class, and he will learn how to pay taxes to government .When he learn information about paying taxes , he will teach other people . Everybody will know how to pay their taxes. When people have a better job, they make money, and they will pay taxes to the government. Government with taxes build hospital,school, and library.

Thus, If students want to be useful for their country, they should take career courses.

In conclusion, taking career is useful for students. Above all, taking career courses is a good idea because they can improve their skills and find favorite job for their future. Every student needs to take career courses. Student please take a career course because career courses are fun and useful, and the future of your country is on your hand.",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,7.0,6.290767669677734,6

Because for many people is their first job and they don't have experience in none type of job. So how they can have experience, if they never work. The companies or employers have to look firstly for someone how wants to work, someone how is responsible, honest and hard-workers. Many people have experience but they are bad employee, that they don't like work or they don't like that type of work and they are not responsible.

I think the employers can evaluated to the employee during a couple of time and see is he/she is a good worker. Because you don't know is a person have potential in something if they never try or if no one give to then the opportunity to try it. During the time that they are learn how to work, the employee can have a supervisor how tell and see if the work that he/she is doing are good.

The majority people want to work, but most of then can't, because they don't have experience. The employers are looking for someone who have experience. I think one of the most thing that the employers have to evaluated in a new employee is the responsibility, because is the person is responsible, punctual and honest; he can be a good worker. Many people have experience, but they are not responsible; they arrive late to work, they don't do their jobs.

Some people don't have the opportunity to try a new job, because the employers don't let them. But there is many people who are really good workers, and the most of then don't have experience in some types of jobs.

think the employers should have to giving to them a opportunity to those person how don't have experience, evaluated them for a time and look how they work, if are then responsible and honest. In this case many people can have a opportunity to have a job and this can benefit both, such as the employer and the employee.

First, people all over the world are influenced by somebody; If it's not your mom or your dad, it could be your sister, brother, or even someone famous. People look up to other people. It's a way of saying, I want to be like him or I want to do the things he does. You can be anybody you want to be. You just have to be confident and never negetive.

I look up to people too, but I do myself. I stay in my lane, I'm not worried about anyone hating on me. I feel like I'm different compared to others. If I want to be like somebody, I'm going to do it different. In other words, I'm going to be my own person.

9820AAB8EFE1,""" No act of kindness,no matter how small,is ever wasted""

said The ancient Greek storyteller Aesop

Kindness is a huge part in life that makes us grow and have a good,loving,and kind heart. Everyday we need to show kindness because we are helping people who have a bad day or going through a rough time .I have been one of those people who are going through a rough time and its hard and sad. Last year at my old school(it was a private school),i was lost. The people that I trusted were fake and their kindness was fake. I needed someone by my side but they didnt care. The only thing that was important to them was themselves. They didnt care about other peoples feelings except for their best friend. Which i was not apart of. They called me shy girl because i was quiet because when you are new to a school,you get nervous,you felt you didnt belong ,and you say to your self ""this isnt my school"" and those were the exact same words in my head when i entered the building four years ago. I needed a true friend that was going to show me kindness,telling me that everything is going to be ok or i will always be by your side. I cried everyday for that matter. They judge a lot of people who were innocent by their looks or how they act .I felt alone. Until....

The end of seventh grade i transferred to a public school ,I felt alive. I never felt that feeling in years. The people were nice to me .I meet so many nice people. i met real friends .They cared about me,they ask me is everything ok,you are beautiful,you are an amazing ,whats wrong,how was your day,this will make you feel better ,everything they said was kind. It always made my day. I felt that i belonged here. I was so much happier and i am still happy. Any people who do any kind or nice things to me,I appreciate it

.Believe me if you do any kind thing to someone or say something nice to them ,it makes their day because they know they are not alone.

Kindness may not be everywhere but as long as you felt you belong or have a purpose i life ,you have kindness in you and the people around you do too. whatever happens in life, you must have kindness in your heart because one day you will change someones life just like a switch because if you dont turn on the switch it stays dark but when you turn on the switch it is bright ,it shines. Thats how kindness work .If you help people to show kindness ,they will bring kindness back.

I hope people show kindness because they people helped me and i help them. Kindness any little thing you do is something that the people will always remember and cherish. The only thing i always remember and say "" is to always show kindness to the world.""Show kindness and respect always. Maybe one you will change someones life. Showing kindness is the right thing to do. Always Be kind.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.377808094024658,7
92CF5E341FEC,"Have you ever set a goal for yourself to do something better? But in the end you fall a little bit short? In this paper i'll be taking the side of setting a high goal and failing high because of getting straight A and receiving scholarships to college. What I will say about having a high goal but falling a little short is that if you set yourself to a high standard then coming up short will not be perfect but close to it.

First, an example of setting a high goal is getting straight A's in all of your classes for a semester. But in doing so your taking 5 honors and 2 AP classes. You start trying your beat in your classes. You start to turn in all your homework, studying for test, and getting good grades on those test. But you fall short because you didn't do well on 2 projects and end up getting 2 b's instead of having all A's. But you still had amazing grade's and come out with 5 a's and 2 b's and end with a 3.8 GPA. and get AB honor roll at your school.

Secondly, another example can be wanting to get a football scholarship to the Louisiana State University . You do everything you can to get yourself ready to perform at the highest level you can. You get on a great diet, your working out everyday, and you go to camps to get exposure to the coaches. You become the number 1 player in you area but you still do not get the offer to LSU. You feel like you are not good enough to play at the next level because you did not get the LSU offer. But your second school that you wanted to play for comes along and offers you a full ride scholarship to play of them and that school is Clemson University. The National Champions.

Finally, people can say if you set the bar low and accomplish that goal then you would feel good about yourself. But what if Micheal Jordan, Tom Brady, Lebron James lived their lives like that. No, these people decided to get up and do something with their lives and they still think the can be better because the always set a new goal. Tom Brady was asked in an interview once ""How do you keep playing football at 42 years old"" He said "" Because I haven't reached all my goals yet."" Tom Brady has 6 super bowl ring, over 7,000 completions, and is 2nd in most touchdowns thrown ever. But he is still doesn't feel like he's done.

In conclusion, with setting the bar high and wanting to complete that goal but failing short has it's advantages with still being at a high stage in your life because you did work your butt off to get to were you are now. It may not be perfect but it is close to it. If you have taken anything from essay take this go out a set a high goal and work as hard as you can to accomplish that goal because we need more people with that attitude.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,8.0,7.800210475921631,8
4.37E+11,"The school board is planning on adding a half hour to each school day,'' well I disagree''.

Think about like this some students out there have things to do rather then staying in school longer. Some students have sports to play for their teams or maybe there is a school play they would love to participate in. Students would love to see there family members to. Sometimes they come home tired from school or sometimes staying in school longer can give us to much stress in our minds. This is why the school board shouldn't add a half hour to our school days.

Before, adding a half hour to our school days think about what are students doing outside of school that is important to. Most students play sports or do school plays. For example, Generic_Name plays football for his middle school, but if you added that half hour to that school day he would have to stay at practice longer and come home late to. Most students sometimes just give up, because they can't handle having to much work in one day. For instance, Generic_Name is in high school and she is in the 10th grade. High school teachers gave a lot of work through out the day, so Generic_Name have to change her works schedule, because she have a lot of work she have to finish and not only that happen, she have to stay in school longer and its been hard for her ever seen. She had have to take time off her job because of school.

Instead of staying at school longer students would love to see there friends or family member to. But students come home late from school and don't get the chance to see their parents before they go to work or friends to. Not only that every students out there should come home and get to relax or go home and have some fun from all that hard work and stress from school. Adding a half hour means more homework and less relaxing and maybe sleep. Sleep is the most important thing for every students that goes to school. What if they come school really tired, because they didn't get that much sleep last night sleep. Maybe its because they have a lot of homework to do and finish before the next day. That can cause a lot of stress for a students to.

Stress is one of the biggest things for us students eventually if we are this young. Stress can sometimes cause us to do things we don't normally do. For example, Generic_Name has a lot in her mind about school. Generic_Name have a lot of work she haven finish and she is failing her reading class also. She gets mad at her self because she thinks she can't do it , and She also have family problems to. Stress can cause a lot of bad things for our minds even teenagers. Sometimes she even stays up all night just to do her school work, and she don't even get that much sleep at night. That causes her to fall asleep in class and get in trouble to. That even causes her to get bad grades at school.

I think the school board shouldn't add a half hour to our school days. Less time with family and friends and no relaxing and less sleep at night can really affects us bad. A lot of stress that we shouldn't even have and more time having fun outside of school.    ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.889883041381836,7
2E8C8C439D36,"Should the school extend the school day two hours? It depend of the schools and the parents, if they approve the extending of the school days and also see if there is any benefits or disadvantages of this.

In my opinion it can be a disadvantage for some students, because some of the students have to work after the school and they will not have time for do the homework or projects or even their own free time, and that is why they don't have time for do it,but the most problem of this is; if the parents of the students are going to approve or not about this change to the school, because some of the parents take the education of their son or daughter so serious, and that can be one of the big problems to the schools.

But there is too benefits for students or some students only, because they are going to have more time in classes for learn more and also for do the projects in the classroom and not in their houses as homework.

Another benefit too is they can have for time for the activities in the school if that was as a class they have.

I will approve and disapprove, because there is so many disadvantages of this, but to the same time there is benefits too about this change of the school.

Sports is what most of people do play a sport but we always get frustrated when the opposite team scores a point so we try our hardest to score back the point. School is what a lot of humans struggle on its our work sheets and test but every question wrong we get it makes our brain smarter so do our best and not pick the wrong answer. Family is people we love and hang out with all the time but not very often we get into problems but every time we have a problem we just have to find a solution to do our best. This is why I agree what Duke Ellington said about a problem is a chance to do your best.

Sports is fun activity we can all do but most of the people do or watch but a lot of the player or fans. Start to become angry because their opponent scored a point but. The players can solve the problem and do their best to try to get the point back. When I was ten years old i played on a soccer league my team was losing to our rivals our coach told us the problem why they keep scoring on us. The team and I fixed the problem an tried our best trying to win back again and we did win. My brother plays basketball he used to be terrible at playing basketball he missed every shot but fixed the problem by practing more and tried his best. Most of the sports have a problem but they fix it.

School is a place where we make friend learn new subjects. For some people in school they struggle a lot on worksheets, test and quizzes. I used to struggle on test and quizzes but when i got the test or quiz back i studied on the questions i got wrong. So when next time I took the test i would get those questions right. So the problem i got wrong i tried my best to remember it so i would not forget it when i have the same questions on the test

Family are people we love and hang out with but sometimes we have problems with each other. When problems happen we try to fix our way and try our best to not have problems anymore. When I was younger I never wanted to share with my siblings. But i had to fix the problem and try my best to share with my siblings. My older brother dislike me to use his video game so my parents help fix his problem with me and my brother sharing.

This is the essay about how Duke Ellington saying help a lot of people to fix their problem. All of my problems were fixed so it my help people fix their problems to fix them.

C8620D9D22DC,"I think by having older students with younger students would be helpful. Because older students can help the younger students with homework,projects and classwork. Older students how to do the right things that can help the younger students.

To begin with, having older students can teach the younger students on what they need help with in school. This can be really helpful to younger students because with help someone that is older then you they can help you improve in school. Like for example my friend is one year older then me and helps me with school work when I need it. Older students can help teachers by help the students with classwork. Having older students in a program can be useful because they can show the younger students how to act the right way in class,and show others to do what they need to do.

Additionally, younger students can look up to older students that they trust. Because they have helped them in school and having fun spending time with each other. Some younger students might think an older student can treat them as a sibling. Like for example I see one of my friends as a sibling because we have been friends since we where little and I trust them. So it's good to look up to some one that you trust and count on and be their for you when you need them.

Finally , I think having older students and younger students in the same program would be great. Because older students can show the younger students how to be right and do what your teacher tells you what to do. And parents want their kid to do good in school so they can have a good life to live. Having a mix of older and younger students can learn to do things together. By having older students it can effect the younger students to do good in school.

In conclusion, I think it's good to have a mix of older and younger students to be in the same program. This can help older and younger students to work together.

The reasons I feel like a positive attitude is good because i am a kind person and dont get in to trouble with none because there is no reason to be mad and angry about small stuff. I fell like other people might think different about what I think because we all think different about everything. If you go to a friends house and you be all mean and rude and all dirty people are not going to like you because of the way you are and the other hand if you are all nice people they will like you because of how you are you and that you have respect of how your attitude is if not then you will not be wanted by people because of you act and are and people who act all rude end up in places they never thought they would end up in i just saying just stay with a positive attitude in the world and you will succeed in life and be great and not have to go through stuff like get in to fights or locked up in jail. I meant i know some people that have bad attitude and life and they are doing great in life but there is going to be one day that you will get in a problem by the way you act i think that just stay with a positive attitude so you dont got to worry about anythings and that its just better way to get al the things you need and would like to active in life because why be all rude when you can just be sweet and caring then be all grumpy and mad about small little things that can be fixed because thats what I think but if you have a bad attitude you might like end up saying or doing something that you will regret like if your like taking and with a attitude you might end up saying stuff that you dont mean and if your normal and calm about stuff you dont go to worry about nothing. I also been told that if your have a great attitude you wont have to worry about stuff because why would someone care about how you are if your all nice and not rude.",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,5.0,5.558073043823242,6
694C96A1E9A0,"It has being said that a positive attitude is the key of success in life. Many people might think different from what i do. I agree with this statement, because being positive in life makes me happy and when i am happy i do my work with happinest. Maybe not all the time my work is going to work out but at least i had fun doing it. During the time when i am doing my work to reach the goal, i am always being positive. When i play soccer for the school, and we have hard games aginst others schools who have a better team than we do, but no matter what i am always positive. Also when i am at work i have stuff to do before leaving my work. i dont like going home late, so i am always positive that i will be finishing all the stuff so i can leave work early.

Doing my homework every night is a stuggle beacause i work everyday, and i do not get time to do it before going to work. So what i tried to do is do all my work fast at work so like that i can go home and get my homework done.

Playing soccer for the school is the most fun activity i have done in my life, because i get to meet new people and compete against better players. Sometimes i have to play against some players that are really good at soccer and i might not have a chance to beat them but that doesnt mean i will stop being positive. I am always telling my self i can do it. I tried to pass my positive attitude to my team mates. When everyone starts being positive we play better games and we beat the good teams that we could not defeat a year ago.

I love my work, but sometimes i am to tired and i just want to go home.

I do not get leave my job till i finish cooking all the stuff that need to be ready for the next day. Also i got to clean the floor an the kitchen. If i want to leave early i need to be positive, that i will finish every thing fast. Like that i would not have to leave late. The good thing about my work is that i get to work with my best friend, he is always positive like me, so we do our job faster but well done.

When i get homework and i have to work the night i just want to cry. But i tell my self that if finish all the work fast. I would get to go home and do my homework. i would not have to go to sleep late, beacuse of my work and homework. Being positive helps me finish everything fast so can go to sleep fast.

In conclusion, Being positive is the key of success in life beacause, being positive gives you happinest and makes you do your job with more joy. Many people should change their negative attitude because neggative people never succed in life. When you are a positive person more of your goals are going to be achive. Also just not that you will make other people start being positive.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.33925199508667,6
B265B2EEBEDE,"I think that for schools offering distance as an option for student to attend classes from home is not going to benefit the majority of student whom are taking this method as a way of learning. I believe the majority of student are going to disagree with this method of learning because we all know that it is going to be difficult task to learn with out a teacher who is standing by your side. Generic_Name she was a student who did attended classes from home, she explained to me how difficult was to attend classes from home because you had it to do all of the assignments that it had been gave it to you to do it alone more like homework, She also told me that sure the assignments were well explained but still it was better to have a teacher by your side. I had heard a lot of stories of students whom had failed the classes by using this method because of the difficulty to learn and concentrate at home. My old friend Generic_Name told me that in, 2010 he attended classes at home, He said that he did passed his classes with good grades but did not learn anything because what he said that he did with all of the assignments that they gave it to him was just search for the answer online and then copy and paste then send it to his teacher and that it how he had good grades but did not learn anything, at the end he told me that he did not benefit from attending classes at home.

I really do not thing that there are any benefit for student to attend classes at home instead of going to school. For example my self I would not be able to used this method to learn because I have a brother and two sisters, they go to elementary school all of them are younger than me which it means that when I am home I need to take care of them because my father and mother they come really late from their work so I am the only one who can do the task and that meas that I will not have enough time to do my school work at home. There is a guy in Generic_School, they use that program in which they let students to attend classes at home, His name is Generic_Name, he wrote an essay explaining that students were not benefit by using this method of learning at home and what he said was that so many student were arguing about this method, some of them said that they were not learning anything by them self while others said that they rather take classes at school were there was teachers and time to to there work better. I believe that even some teacher will disagree with this method, Generic_Name said that it was possible for a student to yes learn at home but it will be a difficult task to do so she recommended to go to school to get to pass your classes and learn what you need to learn.

Of course there are students whom do think that attending classes at home will really benefit them. Like my cousin Generic_Name, she is a student who does not work nor have a brother or sister so for her is really simple to concentrate on her work and learn without a teacher explaining things to her because she is really smart but that is only because she can and have the time to do it not all of the student have that. Another student from Generic_School, he graduated using this method in, 2015 he explained to us how hard it was to used this method of learning at home also he recommended student to go school isn ted of doing it at home because it would be really difficult for them. My teacher once told me that it was way better to go to school where you are going to have plenty of teachers whom are going to be there to help me, she said that it was not worth it to study at home alone.

In conclusion, I believe that school should not have the opportunity to let student to attend classes at home because of the difficulties and the struggle to learn by them self when is really simple to learn at school were there are teachers whom are going to be right there with you helping you in any was as possible and that is how you can successfully pass all of your classes with good grades.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,5.861982822418213,6
85408CA46C97,"i think this is a good idea to graduate high school within three years instead of four years. By working hard, get a good grade, pass all the SOLs if needed to graduate early you could make it possible to all those students who give up on trying only once and lose hope after failing it. Some schools districts offers programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, by taking summer school courses, or sometimes after school to graduate one year early. This amazing idea makes every student get early high school diploma so that way, they could start their college and finish it up early then get their dream job, good background, and be successful. Those students who start good from their freshman year in high school could graduate in their junior year. School is the only place where every teen or adult has the opportunity to choose what want to be, what they could learn to achieve their dreams. We all know that learning is the way to guide us to get ride of the laziness, and help us be successful in our entire life. we should not lose this chance and work hard on it to achieve something good and helpful from it. If a student graduates one year early he/she could start college and work at the same time plus free tension of extra credit. And those who finishes high school early could take a break for one year start working, buy house, car, make money, prepare for the university, travel around the world, visit home country, and make their dream come true make their families proud. If we want to be successful and want to get ride of homework and 6. AM alarm we need to work harder. Failing does not mean we should not try again, to get to something you really want, you need to work for it because if you just dream about it, that does not mean you will get it easily. Each one of us should be responsible for our grades, classes, and our scores because these are the things that could help us graduate early. The reason why its better to graduate in three years instead of four is that we could start on our career early, we could head off to some more interesting courses in college and university. back than 90s high schools did not had that type of opportunity to graduate within three years, unless they passed all the classes early. But nowadays we all have our unique chance to get it done, but not just sit there and wait for it to come to us. we have to fight for it. ",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,5.0,7.111926078796387,7
F49521C3494B,"In some schools they have programs that pairs older students with younger students, and the older students can assist younger students if younger students are having troubles with their education or any other problems. This program can help old and young students because students get to support each other , and older students get to know how to be responsible , and they have a good experience.

First the older students can support younger students by communicating with each other if they are having problems studying, or problem with another students , or probably they have problems outside of schools for example they are having problems at home students can support each other by helping them to find a better solution so that everyone can feel better.

Next this program can help older students, because they get to know how to be responsible by helping young students to improve in their school subjects, and they can improve confidence in themselves by helping each other.

Finally at the end of the day older students are going to have a good experience knowing that they help a younger student to improve in their school subjects ,and they improve in their communication skills .

Schools with programs that pair old and young students can help students in a lot of thing , for example communication skills , responsibility,and be confident in themselves.

7F4706C105DE,"Do you agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? Yes because in order for you to be successful you have to fail a couple of times. For an example when

I was 10 years old I lived in Miami Florida and I played football. Every kid I went up against they were faster than me and better and I got mad because I was not good enough. One day the coach pulled me after practice and told me what's up this is not the kid I saw play football in Miami Beach. He then matched me up with the best receiver he had and I still didn't surprise him with that kid he saw on the beach.

After a while of training and training back to back coach then matched us up again now I was faster and better it got to the point where I was his star receiver that season we finished 10-0. We went to playoffs and finished 5-0 coach was really happy in 10 years of coaching he had never achieved something like that with his football team. But it was the final game everything changed the team we went up against had stronger and bigger players they first took out are running back with a neck injury so that left me playing two positions. We were up 21-7 its second half 2 minutes before half and next thing you know I had both tight ends and safety hit me at the same time both tight ends hit me in my knee and I was done. What hurt the most was seeing my coach not being able to concentrate he had then even left the special team coach run the plays all because coach went to check on me.

He asked the doctors was I okay and they said he is done he cant play neither can he walk. After that coach went outside mad he was really mad and he then saw the score board it said 28-7. We were still up than theres the halftime coach talks to the players even I did so and they go back on the field we are on the 40 yard line and next thing you know boom are star quarter back is hit. He is not getting up his spine was broken and he could not even move after that coach knew we lost the game but coach did not know that i was feeling better without coach knowing i wen't back on the field the score is 28-28 theres 30 second left and the ball is on the 50 yard line. Coach starts to see the formation he than knew I was on the field and he tried calling timeout but there was no time out left coach knew I could throw but the team did not know my friend Ricky is running he cuts back and runs back up the field as fast as he can I throw the ball he catches it on the 10 yard line and he gets the touchdown coach than ran on the field and picked me up.

Coach then said how did u manage to hold in all the pain after being hit like that I told him the same way my brother managed to cover me when there was a drive by and he was shot 9 times. Coach knows I came from a rough spot in Miami especially the projects. Now i am 17 and i learned from my passed i learned from being a failure for you to be able to be great you gotta fail no matter what nobody is perfect. My brothers always told me if you eat okay now you will eat better tomorrow it is a saying just about being able to actually grind and stay humble. sometimes in life things will not always be easy because that is just the way things are and i personally will be better from yesterday.

How do you think all the star people from now and days have so much money they were not good from the jump they failed a lot in life nothing will never come easy to be great you gotta beat the great. Football players dont just get to be star just like that they gotta earn it. Rappers dont get to get platinum just like that they gotta make good songs. Everything in life is a sacrifice you gotta humble yourself and be able to go out and get it because nothing will be bought to you. you can feed a horse but you cant force them to eat it.

F0116D8BA334,"Do I agree that my school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Some of this businesses have adopted a four-day work week, without thinking about the consequences. Each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resources which it would be difficult for them since they will be working ten hours per day during four days of week. Taking the model of the businesses expending school day to conserve energy and resources, with each day consisting of two hours will be a difficult choose to make. First of all the government need to be part of this decision, and need to be include to see which are the consequences going to be in taking this choose. personally i am fully disagreement with this model, but not only myself is in disagreement there is a lots of people that believe school should not follow this model to conserve energy and resources by expending the school day two hours. The government and society is the one who's need to be taking control of this decision, because they know what is good for the students and what is bad for them.

In a society it is unlike the average American work week, so it would be difficult for families to adopt to the changes. Having longer school days and shorter weeks does not align with the structure of a typical parent's work schedule. Most students being involved in extracurricular activities after school, and not being able to drive, the four day school week will create many conflicts. Parents will most likely struggle to get their children to those activities and anything involving life outside of school. Most parents would have to adjust their work schedules to accommodate for the new school hours. Also, an extra day off for students but not necessarily for parents and child care would be required for the younger students on the extra day off. Additional expenses such as that are not always easy for families to come up with. Lots of changes would be put into action. Some others believe that the positives of changing to a four-day work week outweigh the inconveniences brought on by extending the day.

Their main rational revolves around improving to transportation, building and it will be good for students to be able to have more down time.

Taking part of this i would argue that the benefits seen so shortage, like a lack in the amount needed. In real world application of this plan applied in a education settings does not posses the same bonuses. The advantage of having another day off most likely Friday, while promising, does not necessarily means a day without work to do. In fact, there is a lot of many ways that you can conserve energy and resources, some business adopt different ways to conserve energy and many resources. Although i do not like this plan that our school should fallow this model (their plan is so bad), if we start doing this plan we will be in a several problem. We usually go to school seven hours per day, and barely have time to do our homework after school. Students like me need to go work after school, since some of us are living already on our own and this plan will affect our jobs.

In conclusion the idea in adopt a four-day work week, is not the best plan to conserve energy and resources. This plan is not the best plan that this businesses company have came with. There is a lot of consequences that need to take care of, before get into the point that you can not have the right for a opinion of what to do and what not to do. In this plan i will rather say that the school should not follow any plan or anything that is not for the goods of our students. Speak with the society about it and then make a choose that it is going to effect for good or bad. Sometimes changes are goods, but not on this plan people said that there is some benefits and what i see is just disadvantages on this plan. Adopt a four-day work week, is not the only you have to save energy. There are so many ways to conserve energy and resources. Example: not use a lot of water or try no to use the electricity that much last, but very important think first and then do the use the plan or the choice that is best.

918C1880FCD8,"When did you decide to research your future job?

Students should start thinking of a certain career they would want to encounter by the time they reach high school. by the time students reach high school they must have a job they're interested in. If students start viewing the concepts they need, they can become what they want to be. Also by starting early with a goal, researching, and acknowledging goals they can find a job that they would like. Also will have a distinct idea on how to succeed.

First step, In most societies students start researching different jobs at a young age, so they know what they want to become in the future. Research helps students find what they need as a teenager, for example: getting a Standard or Advanced diploma, going to College, and getting a degree. when students start encountering what they need to accomplish they will tend to work hard and start receiving the information they desire. Also research gives a better understanding for the student to know what to find. Although some may say ""Information online may be false"" but there are multiple sites you can examine to observe the true facts.

Second reason, Goals help students with finding a career to start. Goals help by giving an idea to a student of what the second step is, to find the best career for them. Goals can be both limited and unlimited. Although some may say ""Students should start thinking after they graduate high school because there's many jobs in life students might pick the wrong job"", but starting young helps the teens mind to find different careers. Also students can decide what they would want to commit to.

Third reason, Acknowledging your goal will take a very important role of students life's. If students complete their goals, and research they can acknowledge their goal. Examine the work they have finished and look through to check if they are missing anything. After students have finished their steps students may continue on finding a job that they want from the data they collected. Finally acknowledging goals will help in examining job duties.

In conclusion students should start finding a job early. Starting young will help each individual student with, finding a job, how to determine if the job is right for you, and following along with accomplishing every goal. Students will have a less stressful time finding the right job. These 3 steps will help students find the right job: Goal, Researching, and Acknowledging their goals. Also it's a good idea for young students to have at least a couple ideas of what they want to do as a career after high school. ",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,8.0,7.8627824783325195,8

Yes, we should follow this model and extend the school day two hour more. One day of energy that we save is not going to help just us, is going to help many people around us too. But this change can cause son benefits and disadvantages for the students too.

Having a four-day a week can be favorable and cannot be favorable for many students. Why can be favorable? can be favorable because some student would like to have just four school day. not matter if they have to stay two more hour in the school. They are going to have one more day off to have fun and relax. Also can be favorable because the students can work more with the teachers. Adding a extra time to the classes it's will help that the students focus more in the topics and get all the work done and do not have too many homework.

Why this change cannot be favorable? cannot be favorable because a lot students like me that have a part time job, we cannot be able to arrive our job on time if we change the normal schedule . This change of four-day school week is going to mess up our personal schedule and cause some trouble to us. This new change also can affect the learning process of many students because they already are familiar with the normal schedule. Adding this two hour and having a school day left in the week, can make them low their grades and difficult them to have all the work done.

Four-day school week can help and save many hour of energy waste. For example just think about one day for week not sound like is it too much, but doing this for a moth or for a year can really make a difference. This time that we can use to benefit our community and conserve our natural resources because waste energy can damage other natural resources that are necessary for us to live like a water.

In conclusion I think that not just my school can do this. Many other school can start with this model too. More businesses and people of our communities also can contribute to this cause. If more people get together more we can do to save and conserve energy and our resources because is our responsibility to start making a change, a change that is going to benefit all of us. Just think that one day can make a big difference.        ",2.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,5.0,6.101134300231934,6
CA64C82B0F26,"I think i agree because you can learn more and study more and the electives will be longer and it will get better and better and you can use it in any class so it will be longer and.

Dear Generic_Name

I write to teacher Generic_Name today with the benefit of work in group. The work in group is more better then work alone, in the beneficial is the student work in group is have more opportunity of learn more with other students in the class, they can work more better and understand more quickly the theme in the class and have more collaboration, learn to respect other students. They in the group can say new ideas for the team.

I think in the personal the work in group is more productivity in the student because have a good communication with the students and teacher, they have more positive attitude in the ideas and participation.

For example, students in the group work more and learn more quickly because in group have a higher quality of ideas, and students can change ideas together about the theme in the class and have a better determination in the job of the class.

Second, work in group have a big benefit in the class because students understand problems more quickly, and they have solution in theme complicated with ideas and dedication in class.

Third, students have collaboration with other students have a good relation and learn to respect others person for religion or ideas. They have more communication in the class and have more better grade in the school.

However, work alone not have good result because almost all the student have fear to say ideas for the critic of other students in the class, and they have slow work in the class for complication of the theme.

The preference is work with a group have more benefit in the student and teacher to learn and teach other students in the school have more communication, better work and good relation in the school.

sincerely

CEACA9EC34F8,"what's a curfew? a regulation that specified persons be off the street at a set hour of the evening.

I'm agree with the curfew law because i think it will keep teenagers out of trouble,parents are going to know where there teenagers are and alot of teenagers are going to be safe because in the night is the perfect time for the killers to do they crimes.

The curfew it will keep teenagers out of trouble because they aren't going to be hanging out with there friends in the night so the means that they aren't going to be in car accidents because now on this days must of the teenagers consume drugs so if the curfew is adopt we are going to givet the teeanagers a better protection, one of my friends they got arrest because he was involve with the ganstars and they killed someone he didn't killed him but he was there when they did so he was involve so he was guilty of homicide.

The parents are going to know where there teenagers are going to be at because most of the teenagers they never tell there parents where they are going, where they are going to be at so thats problem because if the teenager has a accident or something bad happen the parents they aren't going to know and in any case they have to go to the hospital the parents can get in trouble for not preotect there teenagers because even if there parents don't let them go out in the night most of them they sneak out and when something happen the parents are responsible for that.

Now in this days the night is a great time for killers to comit crime if we go back in the times we all known ted bundy one of the most serious killers of the united states,most of all his crimes happen during the night, the night is a really disvantage for all the people not just the teenagers, if we adopted this curfew law we are going to give them more protection less crimes are going to happen, we can't stop the killers but we can give more protection. If we protect our teenagers we are going to have a better future for them, they are going to focus more in school, they are going to be involve in any problems. the curfew is a good way to prevent crimes.

in conclusion of all of this curfew is good way to keep teenagers out of trouble, I'm pretty sure that teenagers aren't going to agree with this law but if parents agree they are giving a better protection for there teenagers, just by securing the teenagers life in the night we are saving them because in the night anyhting can happen and we want the best for our teenagers, teenagers are the future of any country, they are the future.",2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.688095569610596,6

3F1ED9A56002,"The one thing students shouldn't have are phones. Why?

It is because students in different country always use their phones for my reason

The first reason why students shouldn't have a phone because of social media. What is social media that you might be asking? Well social media is where people can comment on pictures or video. The one that i should add to that is that students everyday will always go on their phone and posted a picture or a video of them self or with someone.

The second reason why students shouldn't phones because they might have download something that could get them hacked or giving information to someone that they don't know on the internet. The third reason why students should have phones because sometimes people can get bullied on the internet which the term is called cyberbullying. What is cyberbullying that you might be asking? Cyberbully is another form of bullying, but it is on the internet. The third reason why students shouldn't have a phone because some students will sometimes look on their phone without looking at where they are going. Some students got them killed because of that reason. So I suggest to not use your phone while you are walking across the street. The fifth reason why students shouldn't have a phone because of you posting a picture of you in a different country. Well that is risk because you could get robbed. How do you even get robbed first of all that you might be asking? Well you post a picture of you in a different country and that is giving the robs more of a chance to rob your house. The sixth reason why students shouldn't have a phone because they might prank call some local fast food restaurant. If you prank call the police, you will get yourself in trouble for that reason which many people in different country prank call the police for funny reason and also bad reason. The seventh reason why students shouldn't have a phone because it could explode because you are using all the time. If you are using it none stop, then it will explode on you so I suggest that you should use it for 2 hours or so. The last reason why students shouldn't have a phone because of how addicting it is to everyone.

That is the reason why students shouldn't have a phone",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,7.0,6.403648376464844,6
620B05CFFC39,"Something I would like to accomplish in my future is keep learning how to play new sports and graduate with good grades so I can be succesful in life. I think if i play a lot of different sports and keep my grades good i have more chances to become more succeful becuase i have more opportunities to do different ype of stuff and i won't struggle a lot to become successful in my future.

For example, once I met this girl her name was Generic_Name she said that when she was in middle school and high school she joined a lot of different clubs and started playin different sports like track, vollyball, and basketball and by doing that she made a lot of credits that are needed to graduate. If she would've never focus on school and all that she would'nt have enough credits to graduate becuase what helped her get credits is by playing a lot different type of sports and joining different type of school clubs. Everyone should be worry to get enough credits before graduating sop it can be easier to find a job and be more successful.

In addition, for Generic_Name to play sports she needed to have good grades so if Generic_Name would'nt have good grades she couldve never join anything which means shw would have to strggle mre to get the credits and graduate nuh it would be more diffilcult nd harder to find a job so we always need to focus on what we need not what we want so we can be more successful and wont have to struggle much but we also need to work forwhat we want. I would also like to lear how to play other band instruments becuase i just think it's fun because you get to experience other stuff for example when i was in 6th grade i use to be in band i use to play the trumpet and the whole band group we would go on field trips and play at different places and we would havew a lot of fun and even though i liked it a lot i had to practice fo hours so i would get the notes right with out messing up when im at a concert .

when the teacher change the yaers for short is more good for the students, and then the students graduate more fast ,and when take a summer school, and take more clases he needed and then is more good because the years are more short because when the studentent enter in the college he need to studing more years because depend the career he take then another good idea is when you come to another school he need to put the clases he needed for grauduate becasue when you come the another school he put elctive clases and then is not good because the students he needed to take more years ,and then is a bad idea because the students take the clsess he needed for graduate then you talk with the principle an say i pay my clases with a needed in the summer for gradaute or online clases is a good idea because you need to pass old clases for graduate then the sutedents need to work hard becasue for graduate ,and then going to the college or when you not going to the college, and you work and different types of work because you not need to take more years in the college because you not have monry for pay the college because you not studing anymore, and then the student like to take short for graduate more fast for not graduate in three years is more good for every students, and then not take more time to studing and then graduate and go to college then very good then go to the college then when you finis your college is good because you have a good work and then you make money ,and then have more opportiunity for you need to work in different work is more esay to take work because you have the high school and then is more good for the students and the not have a problems to take another job.",2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.316971778869629,4

I agree that the school board should increase half hours each day. As a student I think if the school board increases the time it will help. For example, students will have more time in class to get their work done. That will help the students have less homework so when they get home they can relax or go outside and play and have a break from school. Finally, the teacher's will have more time to teach their students what they need to know so they can have a better understanding of their work. For example, I don't have enough time in class and there are a lot of students in my class so the teacher can't always get to me to help me understand the work so I have to finish it for homework so once i'm home I try to work on it but it's really confusing if you don't understand how to do it.

760988C4BA3B,"In the future, I hope that one day I will win a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament. Growing up, Smash Bros has always been one of my favorite games as a child and it had helped bring my siblings and I closer together. I can get paid for winning a tournament, and it will help me get through in life. I know that I can't just win a tournament right off the bat but I want to try, because the thrill of just winning and having fun is what makes people enjoy this game. Winning a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament is something that I can enjoy while helping me in life.

""Super Smash Brothers"" had helped me bond closer with my siblings throughout my life. Even if we've gotten tired of doing other activities together, we've never got tired of fighting each other in the game. Fighting with my siblings had molded me into the competitive person I am today, so because of that I want to fight other people and get something out of it. It helped me learn to be competitive because it's a competition in the real world. Smash Bros helped me discover other games to enjoy with others like Kirby franchise and the ""Legend of Zelda"" franchise. Beating other players with characters I love makes me want to play more with new people. I never really had the best communication skills, but I can enjoy playing different video games and competing in tournaments with others while improving my social skills.

Winning a tournament can help me get money, so I can buy my necessities in life. Getting the money could help me buy luxuries like a house or a car. If I can win a tournament and get the money, I could have those things and even get more that I need. If I can buy those then I won't have to have help from my family. I could get other games that I enjoy watching other players play. Just by watching people play these games makes me want to compete with them. I always loved competing with others and now I could even get paid to do so if I win a tournament.

""Super Smash Bros"" just gives me the thrill of competing with others and having fun while doing so. People always get this thrill of winning and it keeps them going to win more. Every time I beat my brother in a game I get excited each time, and I want to beat new people just to get that thrill. If you don't get that thrill of wanting to do more of what you are doing then you wouldn't do that thing again for a while. Like other games, Smash Bros bring players together by competing with each other and just having fun. I want to experience that with other people in tournaments. Winning a tournament or just competing in one will help me learn that doing activities are not always as fun as doing them with others.

My life will be brighter when I accomplish something big like winning a Smash Bros tournament. I've always enjoyed the fun in playing games with others and talking to them about it. It also sounds great when you get paid to do something you love like competing in tournaments. I learned that doing activities are never as fun when you're doing it alone.

B948405746B5,"Many students like to spend time with their friends in the school. Specially high schools are good places for students to learn and get fun with their friends. By the way some students are coming to school just for the pass their classes and work hard to graduate with high grades. I think graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years from a high school would be good for these students. Because they can go to college/university early, or work 1 year full time in a job to save money after graduated from high school or get more time to think about their career desicion.

First of all a student who graduated from high school in three years can attend to a college early. This means this student also can graduate one year early from the college and start his career early. If this student already decided to which college or university that he wants to go and what career he wants to do, this can be good for him. Also, student can understand how college classes are.

Second reason for to choose graduate early is save money for college/university. Some students who graduated from high school don't go to college/university directly. These students choose to work in a job one or two years full time to save money for college/university. This is a good option for the students who doesn't have money to pay for college/university or who doesn't want to be dependent to his family. Some families don't have money to pay their childrens' school. In this kind of situations students choose to wait one or two years instead of go to college/university directly.

Another reason to graduate early from high school is to get a extra year to make a desicion about career and college/university. Some students think it is hard to choose the right career for them in high school because when they graduateded from university their careers is going to be their whole life. Like an example sometimes students choose the job according to the classes that they liked in their high school but after they go to college/university they understand this career is not interesting more to them. According to the scientistists 35% of the college/university students decide to change their career in their freshman or sophomore year in the university. This shows that students need to think carefully while they make a decision about their careers. Also the career that a student choose effects the college/university that he wants to go because many students choose the university that gives good education and opportunites to this students about their careers that they choosed.

In conclusion I think graduate one year early from high school is a good idea for the students who wants to go to college/university early. Another reason is save money to pay college/university and final reason is to get a extra time to make a desicion about right career and school. I believe also to study and get prepared better for SAT

to get a higher score can be an extra reason. Graduate early from high school is a good idea but also can be hard for all students. So, student who wants to graduate early from high school needs to work hard.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,7.0,7.0152459144592285,7
8E64BE4119C3,"Schools offer different options of schooling, they have is Online School , Public School , Private School and also Video Conferencing . However taking classes from home wouldn't benefit students the same way Public School would benefit them due to the fact; Some students are visual learners, Students wouldn't have a big social life outside of their home , Students can slack on their own education an have no motivation and also they could be relying on Google answers when they don't understand the material.

Students have different methods to remembering a material they have learned. Everyone isnt the same, Everyone has their own different techniques; Some people may be visual learners, They need someone to be speaking to them explaining step by step and some students just like peace and quite to figure it out on their own. Personally I am a visual learner for every subject, I would need my teachers to give examples and to go over everything to me step by step to learn the material the teacher is teaching. My classmate, Generic_Name has a different opinion, Generic_Name needs a quite place to concentrate and to think about his work rather than a teacher talking the whole class period.

In Elementary , Middle school and High school they plan a lot of activities for the kids. Schools have dances, concerts and even field trips being home schooled you wouldn't be able to enjoy none of the fun activities the school would have planned for your classmates. Being home schooled you wouldn't have that "" high school experience "" everyone claims they love so much and would do anything to go back too. Being home school would also effect your social life for the real world. In school they might not have a class for communication but going to a Public schools does teach you how to speak up and communicate with other people you dont know and that would really be beneficial for the real world after school when you go into your career.

On the weekend I personally hate doing homework, I like to think of my home as a lazy environment for myself rather than another school place. I think if kids were to be home schooled they wouldn't be able to concentrate at home the whole time they are supposed to. There would be no consequences for the student as if when they aren't paying attention or just on their phones the whole time. There would be no teachers or administrators to be motivating the student to get to work, be on time or even get your'e grades up. Being home schooled and doing online school they would start getting on the wrong track after some time. If my house for me was a school environment i would procrastinate my school work so much like saying "" ill do it in 15 minutes "" "" ill do it the next 15 minutes "" and so on to the point i forgot because i have no motivation for my work.

Having no teachers or administrator around it would be easy to cheat. not understanding the material and not being able to ask questions your last resort is to cheat for answer. Students will find the answers then think they have a easy way out of online school by relying on Google answers. Students can also pay someone to be doing their work for them and manipulate other kids to agree and do the work for them. Students attending online school or homeschooling have a lot of ways to cheat for their classwork.

I disagree that home school or online school would be beneficial for students because they wouldn't be able to learn and understand everything and to being able to ask questions, Students wouldn't have a social life outside of their home and not be prepared to communicate with people outside in the real world, Students would't have any motivation for their school work and start slacking off and lastly they can find easy ways to get out of their own work and having it done without them actually doing any work.

C8DF8FD0D69D,"""Succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm"".

-Former British Minister Winston Churchill

Immigrants who came from differents countries to United States are the most strongest people in the world.

These people really know what failure means and how brave they are to leave their families and find the success that they could not get on their countries.

That's the meaning of this statement and I'll explain you why I am agrre with this powerful phrase.

I believe that immigrants who came to United States are the strongest people because they have to do a lot of sacrificies before to come here, for example, some parents live theirs children with their grandparents or take the risk to come with them even knowing how hard is the way to come to America.

Its really difficult to come to a new country without know the lenguage, the city, and what kind of peolpe will you find in the way, some are good persons who helps them some of them are racist, they start from cero without a hosue, a car, a good job, being alone and so far from their families, this is how they get the strength to keep moving up and help their families in their countries.

They are the best example for this statement to teach us how can we start from down in a new place and get the opportunity to be in the top without never give up making clear our goals and purposes,

sometimes we want to do something that we really love but we feel afraid to fail, but if we never try we never going to know how it feels like to see ours dreams realized. If you believe in what you think , then it worths and do not let anyone tell you that you can not.

I'm agree with this statement because it shows us a different way to see what we call difficult or imposible to make. When the things are getting hard just think in the price that you will earn at the end or how proud you will be for made that thing that you wanted to do and someone told you that you could not make. Just be as an immigrant, brave, able, capable to risk all that they have to get a new opportunity, a different way of live but always thinking about the yearned price.

I hope you have an idea about this statement means , and do not give up on your dreams and the goals that you made some day thinking about make them reallity and if you always want to triumph you have to spend time on it.

I would want to vist hawii with freinds and family. Because we can go to the beach,we can eat coconuts,ice cream and we can get a nice tan. We can go surfing. Me and my freinds and femily can live in a house all together near a nice beach. And we can have a lot of fun on the nice beach

First we will have to find a house near a beach. Then we will have to put what ever we brought on the trip into the room we picked. Then we can get some stuff for the beach like surf boreds,some sun screen,sun glasses, and some stuff for the sand. And when the sun goes down we can watch it,and we can watch the sun go up in the morning.

After we get the stuff for the beach then we can go to the beach. When we have the stuff for the beach we can use the surf boerd to go surfing. Me and my brother and freinds can have a race with the surf boerds. After we are done having fun on the beach we can stop by somewhere and get something to eat then we can get some nice ice cream.

49E2BDE820BD,"I disagree with Thomas Jefferson because you need to be inactive sometimes to lay back and relax. If you're always up amd doing something then you wont really have much rest. You can be active and get stuff done but also kick back sometimes andrecharge your energy.

Im not saying that you shouldnt do you're work but dont forget to do that work you need to get energy. Another reason is if youre sick and cant move around so you dont have to do anything then as well. There are many excuses for you not to do something.

You should do stuff tho like the important things you need done. For instance go to a doctors appointment or get groceriec. Just because you dont have to do something all the time doesnt mean you shouldnt move from being an idle.

You should never be an idle tho. You should always get up and get an excersise or cardio because laying down and not doing anything can also cause sickness in your body that you dont want.

C0E05400082E,If you want an extra hour of school you suck. The reason i believe we dont need an extra hour of school is because we as a students i need to take a break from school like imagine siting at school for 9 hours thats almost the whole day we need to have fun do something after school like do a sport watch a movie but with that extra hour we cant and studies show that sitting doing nothing not exercising your brain could cause brain damage and potential permanent brain damage. Me being a student it is hard gust to get through 8 hours of school but adding an extra hour i will feel like falling a sleep and studies show that to much stress on a brain can make you forget stuff you learned and if people never tried to get through 8 hours of school it is hard thats why i believe adding a extra hour could hurt students in a very bad way.,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,5.0,5.456286907196045,5
3C2032CEEC9C,"If the students,would assist to class when they're in their home using video conferences or be online i dont think well be a good idea because the students would no be doing that. Because if they're lazy or they don't have how to go to school why they won't assist to a video conferences and been in the computer for a class. I dont think, the students would be studying well it won't be a good method of studying, and the teacher would not be there, literally helping the students teaching them how to do their work. The students can cheat in their work from class and then they would not learn anything what the teacher teach to him and to the students, and the teacher would not be able every time to help them in their work because, is a lot of students who need a lot of help sometimes, and i think the teacher would be busy with the other students. and the students would not assist to class because of that things.

The students need to learn about education and society because if they don have that in life after school would be hard to improve because they don't know how people can be,or maybe they wont like how their teacher are teaching them because they have ones in the computer in online they dont really know the teacher or whos teaching them or if its correct how they are teaching them because if you dont understand the teacher there is other teacher who can help you with it and solve your problems in school you have and like in my country you think school is your other house and the teacher are like you second mothers because they are teaching you like you parents teach to you

One time i was in a online class doing a video call and, the teacher wasn't there sometimes when i need help in my work. And it was like ten people in my class, it was very distracting because, everyone was talking at the same time in the video call. And i couldn't listen well to the teacher. Then i didn't learn well because she was busy. This was in summer school, it was just one month but in my opinion i didn't learn that much i learn more when i was in summer school but in a class room with the teacher and the students in side.

Must of the times their was students they would not there sometimes, and it wasn't like one or two sometimes was more. And the calls wasn't that much of stressful because it wasn't that much of students. And you can learn much better with out them because the teacher has more time for you. the students when they don't go to the class room in school must of the times is because, they don't like how the teacher teach to them but thats a really big problem. Some teachers know you skip their class or others, they don't want to explain you because the student is not there must of the times but the students need to learn in life some times you don't choose your things, like know in school your counselor can help you whit it, change the student with another teacher but when they go to college they do not have that option.

I don't thing is a good idea to have the classes online because when you go to school you learn about responsibility. And how you can improve in a good way how you are, how responsibility you need to be in life, have respect with other people, with your teacher and the other students. You can improve something you want to be after your done with school, like if you are good with society, you can learn in school that you can be a person who likes to talk a lot and you can choose in your life to be a reporter and in school they're programs and classes you can choose, so you can learn more about it.

For been in school you make your life, your own decisions of what you want to be in a future. Find your hobbies your passions. You can make friends in school you can be in contact with them in your live. Know new people from other countries learn about their culture how their are. How people can be in different forms of attitudes and different types of people are in the world.

The programs of the schools at home are not good for people who likes to be in society wants to learn about other stuff, learn of how is society. You can learn about math,science,sports,everything you want but i think learning at school is a better idea for those people wants to really learn what they want to be. Thats why schools are for help, teach and have learn about education for your future.

In my conclusion, for me classes online is not a good idea i don't think students would be benefit being to attend classes from home because is not a good for them. If people lives far away from their schools or they dont have who can take them the Government or the community of the schools should still sending buses to pick up those students. They need to make a solution how students can came and have education. Because education is important in life and been in school it is great. Their is programs of school in house but i dont think is a good idea we need to be in society, we need people who can help us at the time we need, like in the class room teacher know how to teach to their students they studied for that. And going to school you have programs clubs if you like to be helping, studying, or doing sports, and know new people,learn things you even't know about it, or improve your self for you or for your future. Classes online, if is just you and the teacher i think it would be good but still a problem their is not a lot of teachers can teach to every single student,and the students they won't know have a social life and know new people.",2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,5.0,5.4753241539001465,5
7433BE08FC5D,"First, I say the remark that Thomas Jefferson said ""Determite never to be idle . . . It wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" It's very true what he said but to be all honest I say ""It better to relax than doing something that your not ask too."" It's better to relax because your are not worried of ""ohh I got to do this for my job or I get fired"" but that could of been your day off and that you could just relax thats why It good to have some of days. I've worked in a fast food place and I'll tell you It""s not what really expect when It was like a special event I had to ask if i could call off those days and I also had to do it two weeks before it because they could fired me if I didn't go. That's why I had to quit because I""m still young i dont have to start working yet I could just be me and relax with my family and friends. We as humans we have to sleep it doesn't make sence we dont sleep for week we are ganna be the same we are like batterys we need to recharge.

After, also It""s it because you dont know some day out of the blue your mom has has a heart attack and you have to go see her because you dont know if It's going to be your llast time seeing her or your dad fell and you need to see him because your his only son. It's really good to have those days those days can be the bests day off or it can just be a chill day. Those days you can go buy something you always wanted but you were working that you could never buy cause you never had the time to go buy it. Also you could go visit your family in some other part of the world but you really want to see them because you haven't seen them for ten years. Mabye you haven't seen your kids for 2 years or long because you was in the army fighting for American.

Then, what if you had not brakes at work, no sick days,no nothing. Work all day 350 some days with no brake just work,work,and more work that would be fun right no not really. Yours kids are going to ask you dad or mom why are you working so much it your not having any fun or any of that what is your ansewer going to be ""i don't know"" puthetic. Also where does your money got to pay bills,food, and not any fun.

Finally, now lets talk about your retirerment lets say your 75 and your still working be cause the money the government is giving you back is not much to survive with. You have to go work and work just so u could eat and make a living which it crazy. At least when I'm old I want to live with my kids I know there going to be grown but I just wanna be with my kids just relaxing caring for there kids and stuff like that with my wife.

6805FE96E548,"Students having the option to have distance learning would only be great for students who are responsible and cable of keeping up with their assignments. Distance learning is beneficial to students because they won't have to worry about getting up early to go to school and also, don't have to worry about that amount of time they have in class to finish an assignment. Taking online classes gives the student more freedom to expand their thinking while having their own space at home.

A way that distance learning benefits students is not having to wake up at 6 or 7 am in the morning to go to school. Some kids don't show their full attention in school because they're not a morning person. Having to wake up in the morning and sit in a classroom for 2 hours is uncomfortable. For example, I'm not the type of student that can sit in a classroom for 2 hours or more and listen to a teacher talk. I would, prefer to move around and also eat while i'm doing my work that makes me feel more focus. But, in high school your not allowed to randomly get up and walk around it would make the teacher feel unsafe or the students. Waking up at 9 to 10 is a good time to start your online classes because you had enough time to wake up shower , eat and that most important part is that you dont have worry about what clothes your going to wear to school.

Another reason that distance learning is beneficial to students is because as high school students is not really easy to keep up with a teacher. when they're teaching a lesson with 28 more students in the classroom that probably already understood the assignments. There are some teachers are just not the type to go back and repeat their self. For example, When a student miss class it feels like you missed a whole quarter. The teacher is not going to explain the whole lesson to 1 student she would simply say check online for the assignment. This is an example of why students would prefer to take online classes because theres no way a student can be absent. Student can walk around anywhere with their computer or phone and simply pull up the school work and start doing it on their free time.

Some students would say its better to come to school, meet people and have the high school experiences. Although it sounds fun. Theres still students that would prefer being home and getting their work down at home then being in school dealing with drama or extra assignments. Theres students who would rather focus on online classes and finish them and also have a part time job on the side to help them pay for their colleges.

In conclusion, distance learning is an advantage to students who are proactive and for students who learn better on their own. Having to do your school work online and especially at home makes it feel more comfortable. Its also helping students get ready for the real world when they have to take home assignments from work and make sure to stay focus.     ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,8.0,7.552995681762695,8
3DE204C5895E,"Businesses have adopt a four day work week with each day consisting a ten hour shift to conserve energy and resources. Schools are considering to follow this model. Although a four day school week is what every students want, I disagree schools should have to extended two hour more for a four day school week because it leaves student less time to do school work and sports activities through out the day and it will ruin there sleep schedule.

Schools should have to extended two hour more for a four day school week. It will leave less time for students to do there school work and sports activities through out the day. Student would normally leave school around three in the afternoon. If schools extended two hour more from the normal time they'll leave around five in the evening leaving them less time less for homework. Kids that have after school sports, have games and practice for two hour. The kids would've come straight to do there homework and other things.

Schools should not have a four day school week. It will ruin students sleeping schedule. If students are still up late trying to finish there homework, are getting less sleep. Students that have after school sports would stay up later to finish up things they haven't finished. The students that come to school tired always gets less sleep. If a student have a test the nest day and stay up studying, they will come to school too tired to take the test.

Others may say having a four day school week would be great. It will be less stressful for students. Students won't have to worry about school as much and it will leave them more time to do homework on the days off. However, I still believe that having longer hour for school is not healthy for the students. Schools shouldn't have to extended two hour more for a four day school week because it leaves student less time to do school work and sports activities through out the day and it will ruin there sleep schedule.

A3E9A1C9917B,"In some areas they have their students pick their career right when they enter high school to help them, but personally that is not a good idea for students. Students may choose a career, and later on say they dont like the courses they have to take. Some students might even feel way to much pressure having to pick a career at a young age. Others may argue and say that having picked a career at that point, and be sure about it may feel that they are ahead of everyone else and prepared for the future. Others students might have only picked that career, because their friends have chosen the same career. Students may feel overwhelmed, and not like or take serious the career and courses they have.

Students may choose a career and later on say they dont like the courses they have to take. They might feel like that is not the correct path for them. Some change their mind because they may feel like the courses are to hard, or that the amount of work is too much. Others may change because their parents might not agree with that career, because its to complicated. Students may not have fully made up their mind yet if they even want to keep studying anything after high school. In addition, if students change their mind once they might keep changing their mind again and again, because they want to experiment other careers and courses.

Some students may feel way to much pressure having to pick a career at a young age. Kids may get stressed or even overwhelmed with knowing they have to choose something. As well,some students might already have jobs and it could be tiring. Some students could experience great amounts of anxiety, because they may feel forced to take those courses to succeed later in life. Furthermore, students may not like that feeling when they have to pick and rather give up. Some schools could help pick, but students may not like that and feel more pressure. For example, just having to pick regular classes for the year is somethings to really think about, because you wanna take easy classes but yet succeed as well. Adding on, having to pick your career in even harder and super stressful.

Others students might have only picked that career, because their friends have chosen the same career. They might think that its cool and fun, but not realize that it is a bad idea. While they start to spend more time together they could get super annoyed and agitated with one and other. Some of them might have actually like the career they chose and want to do good in the courses they take. In addition, the ones who actually want to take the classes and succeed wont let them if they get annoyed at each other. Teachers and parents may even realize that it wont be a good idea for other peers.

In conclusion, having to pick a career to succeed could be stressful. Students might not be able to enjoy their teen years, because they are focused on other things. Other may also agree that being prepared for the future and having plans is a good thing, and young adults can be prepared for it. Other may disagree and say that kids need some freedom and enjoy life as young adults.

32B2D5592E1D,"This teens manual I talk to talk about expectation. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

The first I ready to talk about some expectation. That's great to some students learning option to take some class in home, for example, some people do others things to help in home one example is he/her work in some place to help his family. Other example, regularity students nope have the opportunity go to the schools because the students things they not equality or things he/her can't do anythings to learning. I support the way to some teachers or one person is working to schools or some people have permission to teacher to go the house the person nope lost any classes they provide.

The another reason, Responsability, for example,

the place where I born people need to walk a lot distance to go learning and graduation some teachers sometime they go to the house where you live to teachers somethings to you. Other example, some time the people nope have transport or some people not have money to pay the transport to go schools. To graduate or learning more you do a lot things to graduate, however, if you put you responsibility you can do a lot or things to learning. Always the people is intelligent to great in school they can obtain beneficial scholarship to helping you and the family.

Reason of this teens. People take classes the way online, some examples, a lot people taking that's way because some people are elder; but they things is better to graduate because he/she work and others things. Some people things that's is more better for then I things that's is great to do both side. People can helps another person or example some reason why he/her taking that's journey to graduate. Always one person in class is coming four or less days to schools the attends is so bad students things is better go to work that's why a lot students take that's route. Some students don't matter anythings about the school, however, students particularity not a lot both some person things bad.

Next reason, offer to learning to night is better too, for example, some people things that is better option too, however, not a lot person have some opportunity to attend classes in home in the morning or late. A lot students take the opportunity to finish the school online. Person take that opportunity is because they have another weigh, for example, they go to work or stay in home to do nothing about his life.

That's great to some students learning option to take some class in home, for example, some people do others things to help in home one example is he/her work in some place to help his family. The place where I born person walk a lot distance to learning and somethings to graduation some when teachers sometime they go to the house where you live to teachers somethings to you. People can helps another person or example some reason why he/her taking that's journey to graduate. Some people things that is better option too, however, not a lot person have some opportunity to attend classes in home in the morning or late. My options I take the position to learning or finish my high school online, because that's really great to explain another person your experience about to finish school online. Always the person things somethings they not have good ideas to his life or something similarity. Opportunity great things for the person have major action.

0B1733D853E7,"Do you know that a majority of people like to go out and enjoy their time? Going out can lead to happiness to some individuals. Therefore, it can have many disadvantages. Some people might find something interesting, while others may not. Playing sports in parks with family and friends, can be a marvelous way to spend time outdoors because it can let us healthier, it can be an entertainment and it can also be a way to spend time with people who you love.

Playing sports can lead to being healthy. For instance, if someone is overweight and wants to lose weight, they can play sports as an exercising way. Until today, playing sports have been a way to become healthier. For this reason, many doctors advise their patients to play sports, in order to get better. While individuals are exercising, they can get entertained.

People can get entertained by playing sports. Often times, people get bored easily and it can be hard to entertain them. However, while people playing sports, they get more entertained than bored. For example, if a family is going out to play basketball, even if a part of this family hates basketball, they can still enjoy it because it can be fun. Finally, playing sports can play a huge role in spending time with the ones who you love not only in entertainment.

Kids and adults like to spend time with people who they like. While playing sports, you can spend more time with the people you love and are close to you. You can also play as a team. Furthermore, you can compete against each others which can sometimes effect your relationship with people you love in a bad way.

student decide if they want to do the fourth of three years in the school,the school gives the privilegi to the student some student take the three because they are not focus on what they do, some student they dont have the opportunity to be studing to get in a better place like the own job or something else some student take the three years depending on how much they are study.

the past years some student are focus in the materials or subject that the school required to be past to the fourth years that they need to be studies and that's how student be in the fourth years of school that they take for a good reason student are allow to the the many years that they wanted or the year they prefer to be in school the las three or fourth year of schools.

the student should need to do more hours in school than less ,because they learn and memorise the impotan things that they need to understand involved in the time ,the most important thing in this is that student should be more time prepared.

l'm agree that the student wanted to take the fourth year of studies in the last three to fourth years that they need to be in the school.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,5.0,4.582129955291748,5
3DCF3E6F4A13,"Well most students enjoy summer vacation because was one of the most beautiful station in the year for one all of students, they enjoy with the families, friends that things in the summer, though some teacher say the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall.

I think that summer is one of the most special station or period because you share more with your Family, Friends, and all students have merit to share more with the most important persons in their lives because a lot of our parents working 10 to 12 hours of Monday to Saturday in sometimes Sunday too, and they don't have a lot of time to share with they families.

In my case, I love when it's summer vacation because I have a lot and good experiences with my Family, with God when left to the house our going to different places, I feel that is these period is when I share more with my mom, She is the most important person in my life, she is who are always with me in the good and bad things, she is who give me advice every day about the good and bad things to not make that things that I don't need to do and don't pass for a lot of things that she pass when she was young, I love these time of summer because is when I pass more time with my mom and she help me to be better every day in my School, Work, Church and everywhere that going.

The mother is one of the most important person what I have in my life because she is who always are in there for me and help to always be good person, good in my school and a lot of more things. And I have beautiful experiences with God and these is that I love more is to pass my time with God because I learn more about things important and that help my life.

I think the 2 months that all students have to summer is a good time because are pass like 9 months in school and these is too much because sometimes you want to make something but school is to difficult and that people can't to share with special people.

Well when the educators or teachers say that summer vacation is too long because student do not retain the information is not true because the students retain these information about Works, Projects, Homework, Classwork the information is in our Brain, Mind, are that things important and basic.

I don't agree that person argue should be year-round and that only have 3-4 weak breaks in the summer is like only one month and you can't enjoy and make your summer funny with you parents because you are thinking in school, I don't be agree with these the summer is when you can pass more time with your important person because there is the period when they have the vacation to, I thing the summer is for enjoy and pass a funny time with your Mom, Father, Brothers, Sisters, and all your Family.

I say that is good to have 2 months and like 2 weeks of vacation because you clearing you Mind, you don't thing in a lot of Homework or Works of School. I have one experience in my life when I were in Generic_City that only thing that I have in my MInd was Homework, Projects, Presentations in my School, Programs of my School and one day my family say I want to going to share with all and I say I can't go because I have a lot of work to do and I need to finished and my uncle say Generic_Name is time to share with your family, is time to you clearing your mind about school and I say another time I need to finish my works about school and all my family going to share and I stay in my house working in all my projects of school and I sit in my room, I was thinking you loss beautiful time with my family for to make my works, and I say is time to you share more with your family because your family in every moment stay there.

Everything the specific moment when you have time with share with your family, friends share because you don't not in what moment you can loss your Mom, Father, Brothers, Uncle, Sisters, Aunt, Cousins, etc, when is time to school make all your works in time.

Don't take you Education like obligation, taken like one of the opportunity to be better.

In some moments you have difficult time but you need to continue, to be stronger, the education is where you learn more about the all things Human, Animals, Solar System, H2o and a lot of things important what help you life in the future you learn things what in your future you can put in practice, you can teaches another person that need to know more.

For everything have time, your Family, Works, Friends, School all these things depends about you, for these reason I think When is time to school is school, When is time to your family is family.

So you need to think and put your agenda in order to you make the important things in order so right now I change a lot of things in my life and these it is the Monday to Friday to be concentrate in my Education, Saturday to Sunday in God and my family, when it's time to pass with my family I pass time with my family and now I share more.

And for these reason I think the summer vacation is important because a lot of students don't have their parents in here maybe live 8 hours, 10 hours in when it's vacation they going to pass time with their Parents.

You need to be have the order in your life you need to make time for everything.

The Education is important because is where you learn things important but most important for me is my family because they can one day no be in here in the Earth because they dead.

And I think when it's summer vacation the Educators or teacher enjoy to their vacation and pass good time with their family and when it's time to come back to school review somethings because not everything forget somethings are in the brain that only need to do is to review.

Then the summer vacation are so good 2 months and 2-3 weeks to you enjoy with all the persons important and special to you, so enjoy and pass a funny summer vacation.

So enjoy, teachers don't thing the summer is too long because is a shorter period that one student have for vacation, teacher enjoy vacation!!.",3.0,2.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,6.0,5.2549638748168945,5
D6FF6E26EB7D,"Being successful in life everyone goes though failure but believing in yourself is the key. Everyone can learn from there mistakes, without learning or believing you fail and stop. People who stop and fail they don't learn from there mistake. The ones who fail and self believe they learn form past mistakes and try again. By practicing over time the person can understand the subject or the materials they'er trying to learn thats how some people can be successful. People who don't practice the won't get any where in life or get to there goals where they need it to be.

Winston Churchill say ""susses is consists of going to failure with out loss of enthusiasm"" yes i do agree with his saying. The reason being if you fail for an example on a math test you got an 53 but now this time on the retake you want to get a 80 now that's a goal you want to achieve. By practicing over time people can learn there mistakes from there past experiences and see how the develop over time. People who become famous, millionaires, and company owners they had good and bad ideas but they still became rich or powerful people by learning their mistakes. Winston Churchill is tilling us that by failure and believing in our self we can successful.

There are many ways to be successful to get where the person wants be to. The first step is were and how to start company or store. Second step is how to get the money, recourse, and a company to. Will the two steps are that easy,step number 1 always start off small use a room or make a stand out of wood if that doesn't come up with other ways. The second step buy the material off the item the cost mummers are buying if that a back fires you can always use you own money to buy the rests like company poster. Thats how some people can have bad or good ideas.

In conclusion people can be successful or not by learning the mistakes they make in the past. Finding a way of how people can practice there mistakes an be more productive in the future. Sitting a goals and having more of what you expected to have for example have a higher score on a math test. Having ideas and recourse to start small business.

4975FA2ABC9D,"In the future what would you like to accomplish in school. Well I would like to know how to play the clarinet and learn how to play it for many reasons.

First, the good thing about about the clarinets is that I like when someone plays the clarinet and it sounds smooth it gives me the chills. Also when they hit a high note on it it gives me chills too. When playing high notes on it it looks easy.

Although when playing the clarinet sometimes when I go to a concert there is always at least one person that squeaks when playing it. I tried to play on it once and its hard to play when I try to play it fast. But the worst part when playing the clarinet is chipping the reed, once when you chip it you won't be able to play as good on it.

The only reason I want to learn how to play the clarinet is because I like the way it sounds, it sounds to calming and soothing. In order for me to accomplish to play calming and soothing is to practice at least 1 hour everyday . Also my last reason to play the clarinet is because i kind of think that it looks easy to play but I guess that it is a hard instrument to play. These are my reason on why i would want to accomplish and play on the clarinet.

ACFF5D0AA57C,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Whether it's on the way you feel or see things first impressions always come to mind whenever you meet someone, or see something that caught your attention. It is almost imposible to forget what your first impression was when you first saw and meet that person. Many ideas could've crossed your head on how you felt until you got to know him or her better. Whether they are positive or negative thoughts they always show up. ""he/she looks mean"" or ""I don't think im going to be friends with him/her."" This are one out of many ideas we all have ones thought about.

Through out my life I've met people that I thought I should keep away from, people that when I First saw them I didn't wanted to hang out with because of the way they look. Like many people I start to judge them in my head on whether this person seems nice or this person is just not the type of person I want to have. Many times without me knowing nothing about this person I start making up ideas on why I should hang and not hang with this person. But after getting to know this person and start to hang with this person, I realize that he/she is not as bad as I thought it would be and that it was me all along confused on how I should really feel about this person. I've learn that first impressions will always come up no matter what and that those are there to alert me in case this person is bad or nice.

Many of my friends always come to me complaining about this person they just meet and how they both feel like they do not like each other because of the way one looked at each other or because he or she didn't talked to them. Always have in mind that if you just met somebody they might be shy to talk to you or some people are just not the ones that like to talk a lot, but that does not mean they don't like you or they don't want to talk to you, always understand them before you make a comment. For example: One time I went to the store to buy some products for my hair, while I was walking around trying to find a good product I came across this conditioner for my hair, and I open the bottle and took a sniff at it, it smelled so bad that I did not wanted to buy it, but my mom told me that not just because it doesn't have the smell I like means that it sucks, so I took it home with me and I started trying it on my hair and it turns out that is the best product that best works for my hair and until this day I still use it. Not just because something doesn't appear good to you means it sucks. Always give it a try.

First impressions affect you in any way, good or bad, they still affect you and all of us. First impressions always change in a good way or a negative way. Some good ways came be you thought you wouldn't like that person but it turned out you both have many things in common, or when you buy a product that you don't think it's going to work or you just don't like but it turned out being so good for you. A negative way in which it can affect you is in the way you see things, that person can be very nice and quiet and you can confused it as she not wanting to talk to you. It can affect you in many good ways but it can also affect you in a bad way.

eighty percent of the people agree on first impresions being almost impossible to change because they haven't fully meet this person. They don't know nothing about each other so it's always okay to have a negative or positive thought in your head about this person you just met. But it does not mean that you are right.

Some examples are: You don't know if this person is good and its trying to be your friend. Another example: you probably think this person is bad but you never know until you really get to know this person and who they really are and that can easily change as soon as you get to know them.

Lastly another example is: this person can be helpful and supportive and you thought this person had other intensions. First impressions are always the ones present. Not everybody is the same, not just because you thought something, makes your thought right but it doesn't make it wrong either.         ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,7.0,7.590786933898926,8

BE4764F7BFF1,"The Downside of Online Classes

A couple of schools offer online classes through virtual videos and video conferencing for students to take from home. Some schools might think that students would benefit from this and others think that this is not a good idea. From my perspective, students would not benefit from taking online classes for many reasons such as; they could get distracted easily, they miss out interacting with teachers and students, and they would eventually get bored of online school at home.

To begin with, many students K though 12th grade get distracted easily. The distraction is not because we don't want to do the work, but it's our minds. Everyone's minds work in a different way and theres always going to be that part of us that gets distracted by the small things around us. Also, technology is somewhat of an issue because it distracts many people because of the games and many apps that it has. Students could go off task and go off playing games or watching videos while they are supposed to be learning and doing their work online. For example, sometimes even I get distracted while doing my work at home through my computer or smart device because of the many other things I could be doing instead of doing homework. There are many distractions online and around us that could make us go off task instead of keeping us focused to do our work.

Furthermore, many students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff. In other words, when you are taking online classes the only person there with you would be your teacher, whom is communicating with you through your computer. No one else would be there with you to help you through it, everything would have to be on your own. Ultimately, if you are in a school many teachers and students would be there to assist you with any questions or concerns that you might have. Also, you would miss out on a lot more exciting events such as school dances,

football games, and pep rallies. There is so much that you would miss out if you wouldn't go to a public school and decided to take online school instead.

Ultimately, you would also be spending almost all day in your house because of online classes. A regular school day is about 8 hours, meaning the online classes would be about the same time , or more or less. In school 8 hours is already tiring enough because of the learning and listening, but think of 8 hours at home with no breaks in between, that would be extremely exhausting. Almost all students that attend school come for a full 8 hour day, which includes break in between classes, then once school is over they go back home to be able to relax. If you are at home for 8 hours doing work, you wouldn't want to spend time relaxing at your home because eventually it would get boring there after a while. In my experience being at home gets boring to the point where I don't know what else to do to not be bored at home. In other words, being in the same place for a whole day would get boring and uncomfortable.

On the other hand, other schools claim that it is a good idea for students to take online classes. They are in favor of taking online classes through video conferencing. Some of the schools think that online classes are a good idea because many students could possibly avoid drama, get 1 on 1 assistance, and learn quicker. Although some of it is true, online classes should not be necessary. Online school should only be necessary if a student does not feel safe at their school because of personal reasons.

Overall, online classes are not a good idea at all unless it is necessary because of safety issues. Besides that, it would not be a good idea because many students would get distracted when they are supposed to be doing work, students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff, and they would spend most of their day at home which is unhealthy.",4.5,5.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,9.0,8.684309959411621,9

F4BE7BB77A43,"Tomas Jefferson say is wonderful how much may be done if always diong. And is one of the reason I deagree with Jomas because if the person always doing something learning stuff they never before do. Is wonderful how much the person can be do and learning new stuff if always work hard. One of the many reason of the human is a intelligent,stroong,smart and do new stuff no matter if they are easy or difficult. If they work hard can be do everithing.

For example the human not born with the capacity to walk or speak all human learng how do new stuff not matter how dificult ther are because more do more learng. One of the big point of always do somehing is prepare for life,is not easy but diong something to make sure the person is in the right way is the most important things the person need to know. Teaching personality and work hard is the big stuff, however one point of life the thing come hard but teaching how go and do resolve the problem. Not matter how be is the problem you need to go and do something then make how strong the person are. The person need to struggle with problems but learning and work hard is the main reason why the person is strong. On one point has the access to take something and work on that, but doing something is how learning new need stuff. Example the person who invent the technology they work hard and always do somethig to make they dream to come real and thas why diong somethihg and do the best potential is how make all the stuff of life. The person who study and prepare to make thay dreams are those work and not matter hoe big is the way they make one aesy way to continue they dream.

Doing somethigs always is the reason why the society do big work define new thing new technology new life becuase always are doing somethis. The person not born with all the intelligent not they learn how walk,speak and one point of life they go to school they not know everything. Not they do something the work hard, however a lot person are very smart but they continue to learn always doing something because they want to a better because they want to suppor the world and they family a better place. Likely the most professional always do something to make sure they life are excel of the most difficult piont of they life becuase always work hard and make new things, because not matter how low they education the person take always can be a better person because always try to define the best decition and the best example to the society. A different way to make the personality strong is find new ways to the problem. Life is like a game more things more work more aesy is to make the things.

If the person always are diong something new and the not choose to stay an d the same place all the time. And the person choose to continue doing new stuff and new work they not need to be the most smart person on the world. They need to work and show they can be do,however they walt to be not matter if they how be a stong personality and not matter is they't go the best school or the best college. Only matter how they be and the profession and the work. If the person or the society do somethig they can be the future. For example one day the person get up and choose to do something and make sure they days are very beautiful do new projects they can be came be make they life more aesy to continue. Life and work are like a gardener more flowes the person add more beautiful they came to be is like work more thing you learng more easy life come. one point they persono can't be continue but all the things thy learn more aesy came to be going up.

That why more things do make goals they persons can find, not matter were the person came or were the born always doing something more intellegent the person can to be. However a lot person are very smart but they continue to learn always doing something because they want to a better or find new technology or make a different on this world. One of the big point of always do somehing is prepare for life. All the persons are not the same one they has more technology to they dream,but others person not and this is not one obstacle to make they dream. Because all the time are be doing something and not wait to came things came not they go find and work hard to make all be came to be positibe they not have obstacles they have the strong to be come a better person. And show everyone not matter how difficult are the problem they came be successfuly person. Like Thomas Jefferson say always diong somethings much be done and is true because the person came to this life and learng everything, a lot person move to other place, need to learng need lenguage, need tradititiones and need people is hard but with the time can be learnig everything and continue the life again with need stuff thas is what is important to always diong on and be done what they need to be done and make sure do the best and hork hard and show a good and strong personality. And accomplish more if always they're something on specific point of life can to be so difficult but working hard and with discipline all can be come more aesy and undertake a new dream and new stuff of life can be come the best tool to widely and known as the most expert guidance to life. Base of all the information always doing somethig more thigs can be done and the persons can be accomplish and determine what strong thye personality they are.",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.39012336730957,4
7862D2AE5697,"Failure playes a huge part of becoming successful. By failing people are learning on how not to make the same mistakes again. For example lets say that i was trying to become a professional soccer. I played for the best clubs, i was named the best player in the team, and i have never been cut from a team. One day my coche tells me that there is a professional soccer try out next week and he want me to get ready. So he gives me a schedual on what i should be doing to get fit. Everyday i have to eat right and train hard. I did all of those things somedays i did not want to train and just start eating unhealthy but i fought through it. Try out day comes and i was ready as i will ever be. we started out with warm ups and went to drills. I was amazing. i was like the best player at the fiald. at the end of the day they gathered every body up and called all the people that made it. I was not one of them. I have failed to become a pro soccer player. Now this is the part where enthisiasm playes a role. I can eather stop playing soccer and choes a diffrent routh or i can pick my head im and try again.

Another reason is motivate yourself have good attitude everywhere and always If you have always good attitude you are felling; your attitude shows who you are is the profile a representation and that identical one that is you the socialism it's importance for

""My social life"". On the social we can share the attitude, ideas . For example If your teacher not had a good attitude you can help and talk with him and know why he has that attitude.

48AC182E4ADC,"Imagine having nothing but sweet time on the palm for your hands. Wouldn't things be easier to do? Imagine the things you can get done with the right equipment. Technology allows such great effects in our lives.

Everything is easier to get, games, books, news, and even shopping would be easier for everyone. Say your teacher wants students to read a certain book but there isn't any left in class. What would you do?. Technology will allow students to download the book and still be on task with students. Some teaches don't allow you to take the book home but with any device you can simply download the book and still be caught up with the chapter. You wouldn't be behind.

Therefore, individuals like being updated whether it's about schools or any world news. Technology allows parent to see what's happening around them and even around the world. They don't like to miss the days news or any news. If they did, they can type the date and see what's happening. You wouldn't miss a thing! alerts will pop up on your device to inform you. Therefore, everyone stays connected to the world in any device. Technology, also allows you to stay connected with other, such as your parents and friends. Imagine having something really important to share with your friends but you don't know when you'll see them, they're just a text away. Let's say you stayed after school but forgot to tell your parents, just call them and tell them to pick you up a certain time. Information will be much easier to receive.

However, some parents say technology is a waste of time but once they try it they'll get many things done. The more we use technology, the more we realize it should have been something back then and how easy things would've been. Technology is for everyone to use not only young adults. It can even be used to keep babies quiet and calm. Some find multitasking hard, but with simple devices, we can do many things at once.

Getting things done makes people feel relieved,for getting things out of the way on to the next. It's like an endless cycle but with the technology we have now, we have much power in just our hands. It may be little power but at least we got things done in an easy matter. We may not see it now, but technology is a very positive effect on individuals.",4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,8.0,7.552067279815674,8

I would like going to the Bahamas because the sea life there. I like watching animal shows to see all the different colors,patterns and different types of fish in the sea. I also like turtles because they walk slow and they look cool.

The first thing i would do when i arrive at the Bahamas is buy goggles then go to the beach and run in the water to find Memo and Dory. I would probably document everything so when i get back home i'll have a memory from when i was at the Bahamas. I enjoy watching colorful fish swimming in crystal clear water. I like when there are all types of colorful fish in groups and swimming together. I also like stingrays because some of them flop on water and it makes it look like they are flying.

There are also sharks for example bull sharks,blue sharks ,and mako sharks. I also like the coral because they come in different shapes,sizes and colors. The coral i like the most is the coral that the clown fish hides in. I would love to go on a cruse and see dolphins and stingrays. I would love to visit with my family one day.

I also like dolphins because they look cool when they jump out the water and they dive back in. It will be cool if i learn how to surf in the Bahamas because it fun to explain to your friends that the first place you learned to surf at is the Bahamas.

7EA986233EDA,"One of minister Winston Churchill most famous quotes is ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Some people think that most people are consists on going with failure as a way that shows us that most people end up with failure again. They feel that it's true most people end up failing and end up doing the same process over and over again. I believe that most of the people should believe that success can be achieved only if you try but you will end up failing some of the times because first reason some people give up so easily and second reason they'll never give it their best some of the times and final reason is that people end up saying ""it's too difficult"".

First reason is that people most of the times end up giving up is because of the lack of things such as work or other sorts of jobs it could also be anything in life that people will give up on. It could be like saying it's a job and your been stressing out so much that you couldn't take it anymore so you decided to just call it quits, but for this problem people should always try there best and never let any other problems get into the way of their accomplishment, all ways stay positive and never lose on what you enjoy like giving up on it.

Second reason could be is that people don't ever try giving it their best it's always a been a problem cause some of the times people end up saying i'm not going to even try. you'll need to give it your best and try to give it all you got it could be on a test or it could also be on another problem in life by doing this you could achieve on being successful and end up doing great with no struggle or bad choices.

Final reason is that people end up saying that ""it's to difficult"" but by showing this people can make it difficult on themselves by not focusing or doing what your supposed to it can be in some situations where you have difficult times but in the end if you end up following direction or staying on task it could led to having a successful accomplishment.

As you have read that people should have any other way but to be always successful and always trying your best, you will end up failing but it's always good to never giving up. Only when will we ever end up failing that will always find a way to end up doing it correctly. On that day will we ever have to worry about failing.",3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,6.536067008972168,7
5ABDBEE915FF,"Most of the successful people have positive attitude and behavior. Some people things that having a positive or negative attitude doesn't changes our life or doesn't bring any success. Other people things, having a positive attitude changes a lot in our life and make us happy. I think, positive attitude brings us happiness and success in our social life and working environment.

First of all, to be happy and successful in social life, we need to be positive. Nobody wants someone who always think negative and give them negative energy around them. But when someone always similes, makes jokes and can make you forget your problems, then we like to be around them. Being positive helps us to make new friends and give the power to make other's day happy. From mine experiences, most of the popular people have positive behavior and that makes them successful in their social life.

Finally, our behavior and attitude changes our working environment. Most of us don't like to work or be in the working environment because it makes us stressed and uncomfortable. But, for someone who has positive attitude and behavior, it's not going to be as uncomfortable as someone who has not. We can example this with a simple and known but never payed attention situation.

Let's think about someone who came late to his work. He might forgot to set up his alarm or maybe he got late because of the traffic... He already starts the day stressful. But if you look at someone who already set up his alarm or calculate the traffic period and move out before that time, he can give himself time to get ready. Also this positive attitude changes the relationship between his coworkers and boss. For example someone with a positive attitude will finish his work at time and be able to work as a team. That will bring him success and make him happy.

In conclusion, someone with positive attitude and behavior can change his social life and working environment with giving everyone positive energy and that is enough to make other people happy and find the success that he wants in his life.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,7.0,6.861883163452148,7

CFD0D13D3180,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill got the concept that ""success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."". Many people failed and successed in life. Some people learn by their own mistake, fail is part of growth. Others, feel like to fail is being a loser and cannot admit their defeat from a battle. In other words, they have no modesty. Success consist to not give up on your goals, to not leave your dreams from a simple mistake; to not describe yourself as a coward.

Many people failed during their career, even the most professionals, but they kept trying. It may be that to fail bring some issues of closed minds, fears, etc. For example, There is a doctor that knows the hard work to finally done with college plus to achieve what you'd love to be. This doctor studied for 7 years, this is a huge and long way of his career. As you know doctors never stop studying because the technology changes every year. Therefore, the start is not easy as, others, thought because the first stage of college, it may be the hardest stage than the others. Some people fail the first test, or the first semester so they prefer to abandon their studies than do better in college. This doctor have failed on the way of his career, but prefered to ask for help instance of giving up. The importance of failing is to learn and the importance of learning is to success in life. Above this, a 15 years old guy used to fail in High School and this student was down-hearted, but the family supported him without criticize him. It was not easy because some are not smart enough, but this 15 years old guy put a little bit of effort and now he is a doctor in Spain.

Failure to faliure is the key of succes. Besides, Failure gives you more knowledge of your mistake and opens your mind to discover news to things to learn. For example, a cook is trying to do new dishes from differents cultures. Now, the cook wants to try peruvian dishes because the gastronomy of Peru is one of the most populars in the world. Also, this would be a benefit because will gain more money. By trying these new dishes, the cook fails because most of the customer did not like the food plus received many critical comments. As many cooks receives many critical comments, they decide to abandon the kitchen and do something different. This cook enjoyed when he commited a few or big error; to do better next time. Learned to do better the new peruvian dishes, listened to the rest of people and finally, succeded in the kitchen.

Some feel ashamed to fail, they usually compare themselves to others because life is a competition and this may bring issues of insecurity. That is one of the biggest problems that many people have in these days. If there are 2 lawyers that wants to face a case of an innocent and important person, who is involved, in a serious problem. The best lawyer would defend the case and will be recognized as one of the best, would get inmmediatly many jobs for being recommended. On the other hand, if a lawyer fails a case would not get inmmediatly many cases often. Therefore, the lawyer knows that to fail have a positive side of learning, gives you more skills of how to face any case.

In conclusion, as Churchill said that to fail is the start to success. As many people fail, they learn. Some people are not smart enough, but they put effort of what they want to do. Even though they fail, they keep trying because is the ability of their knowledge. People that are already professionals, they make mistakes and enjoy of their mistakes because they learn more of their speciality. Finally, even if you want to be the best of something, do not feel ashamed because life is a competition and do not closed your mind of making a few mistake.

657681C4F023,"Falling from a small place will lead to less pain than doing it from a high one. This is something that can be compare to our goals, setting big goals is good sometimes but not always is going to be like that. If we complete they can lead to a big joy and happiness but if we don't they might destroy us. Even though some may say that setting our aim high and falling short is the best this will not always be true, setting our goals at a level that we can complete and keep going is the best option because, after we finish a small goal we can make a new one and keep setting new ones, and setting high goals and falling might lead to disapoiment and depression.

Firstly, setting our goals low is better because when one is completed a new one can be set. This can help to achieve more thins faster and to feel better about our selves. For example, lets say that we get to complete a big goal in 2 years but i this amount of time one can be able to complete 5 or 6 maybe even more of this small goals that can be completed in months or even weeks. Setting our aim low is not always bad there are things that can only be achieve by thinking small. Setting our aim low can help to achieve small tasks that will make the person feel better about him self and push him to keep doing better.

Furthermore, failing on a goal that one has been working on for years can lead to big consequences. For example, a feeling of disappoint that might stop us and make us feel that is not necessary to even try anymore. Let's say that a person is working to enter to a high prestige collage, he has been working a lot saving money and studying hard but then he is not accepted. This person might stop trying and end up with nothing in his hands, why? because this are the consequences of this types of goals aim high either you win or you lose there is not middle point. Some may say that failing is not always bad that one can learn from it but this is not the same for all some can accept their loss but others don't. Aiming high is not something for everybody a person has to be ready to lose and not all the people that aim high is like that.

To conclude, setting our goals at a level that we can complete and keep going is the best option because, after we finish a small goal we can make a new one and keep setting new ones, and setting high goals and falling might lead to disapoiment and depression. Setting our aim low can help us achieve hing faster and keep setting new lines, in the other hand setting our aim high might make us lose years of effort and this is not good.

It's good to listen to peoples thoughts and reaction. You might agree or disagree and whine about a subject. Having a argument is a way of dealing with people. Arguments aren't always bad. Arguments make you talk and reason with people. It's good for listening to other thoughts.

The important of not being basis. Sometimes people only listen to they're point of view. They are on one sided scale and basis. Not basis is examine both sides. Asks questions like. Why is this idea more important than others? Does have depth? Is the idea understandable and matter? Is true or false? Theses kinds of questions are needed. Finding the better response.

Determining the right course of action. The proper thinking process for doing the action. People use techniques to make good decisions. Not guessing what you want to do.

D4B9293426B6,"Have you ever sat down and asked yourself what is next?.Well, in life , there is always one stage where all of us have been thinking about this; what's next? .In the process of growing up , children lacking of plans get confused about what is next ! .In order to avoid that , schools had created an opportunity for students as they are still young .Although some might argue that it is a bad idea for students to be guide toward a specific career at a young age , actually it is better for students to commit to a career while they are still young because at that time , students have a fresh idea of how their future career is going to be like and students also learn about basics as things to do and not to do throughout their professional life.

One reason why students should commit to a career at a young age is that students have a fresh idea of what their future professional life is going to be like .My first example proving that it is better for students to be committed to career while they are still young comes from my personal life .When my dad was in high school , he was really passionate about engineering and wanted to be an engineer when he will grow up .In fact ,He took an engineering course in his school where he learned to build his first robot,how to program a robot , and how to make a robot work as he wanted . Later , my dad went to college and for sure decided to learn more about engineering and robotics .At the time , he was seen as the very brilliant guy in all his class because of the experience that he has.Through is experience in high school , my dad already had a big idea on how his courses are going to be like and also had a better understanding on his subject than many of his class mates. This is a reason why we should all be committed to a career while we are still young and ready to learn. Another reason why students should be commit to their future career at the young age is from the movie actor will smith .Growing up , will took a cinematography class from middle school to high school where he played many roles as the silly boy ,the rough guy,and also the weirdo .Will smith mentioned that theses classes helped him when he attended an acting school after high school where he was asked to play the silly guy which is a role that he already knew how to handle .So,Will Smith taking that simple cinematography class in school helped him to handle his role later in his acting school .Therefore ,Will Smith's example can help us to deduct that it is better for students to be guide toward a specific career as they are young.

Another reason why students should commit to a career at a young age is that when students are committed to their future career when they are still young , they learn about basic as thing to do and not to do throughout their career. They first example showing why students should be committed to their career at the young age is from my personal life .Being in high school , I am planning on being a writer one day so I discussed it with my counselor and we decided that I should take a creative writing class to learn about different type of writing .By taking this class, I have learn about formal an informal letter .I was taught that you always have to be serious , professional and appropriate in a formal letter but in an informal letter you can be a little silly and funny .By taking this class , I I already have acknowledge on a writer ways to write his book and the appropriate tone to use while writing a book . Saying so ,my creative writing class has already showed me things to do and not to do and this is why we should be guide toward a specific career a long as we are still young .My second example showing why students should be committed to their career at the young age is from the well known athlete Christiano Ronaldo. At the age of fourteen , Christiano started playing soccer in his school .He was one of the best soccer player in his school .Throughout his coach , he learned soccer basics and finally became top one best soccer player in the world .By playing in his school team . Furthermore ,Christiano learned his basics and can prove to all of us that it is better for students to commit to a career at the young age .

The other side will argue that it is a bad idea for students to be guide toward a specific career at a young age because students are not mature enough however,it is better for students to be committed to their career at the young age because they have more experience .One example proving that it is a good idea for students to be guide toward a specific career while they are still young is from the well known painter

Frida. At the age of ten, Frida entered her first art plastic class where she learned about color combination , origin of colors and how to describe her emotions by painting .In the future , the art class inspired Frida to give her a plus on what she already had to become one of the best artist in the world of art.

Giving all these facts ,it is better for students to be guide toward a specific career as they are still young and open to learn new things because it help them have a big idea on what's next and also have more experience than others .

Therefore , let's us not worry about what's next ; yet focus on what we have to do to be the next .Life is a game let's not wait for the enemies to attack us but plan on where to hide .",3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,7.0,8.292585372924805,8
A9679CC0C18F,"A city council is debating the adoption of a 10 pm weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. If the curfew is adopted, teenagers on the street after those hours would be breaking the law. Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere in young peoples lives?

Having these curfews are beneficial for us teenagers because, it can keep us teenagers away from these other drivers/people who could be dangerous and intoxicated around these times. Its best for us to just be home around these hours because that's when a lot of kidnaping happens and when people are getting home from parties to where it can lead to injury or even worse as in death. because they can be geting drunk or intoxicated. That's why when kids are usually out late around these times they can be in trouble with their parents or even with the law. And our parents can get very worried because they know how dangerous it can be.

First , most of us teenagers can mess up and end up drinking and driving and not notice how dangerous it can be. So, it's just best if all teenagers can stay home aaround those hours because you never know what can happen to you in just a couple hours of breaking the law. It can lead you anywhere that you don't want to be in so that's why the law is going to try and be hard on you just because they and your parents always wants you to have fun but just to be safe. and not everyone can stay out that late and be safe in those hours of all these parties going on.

However, a lot of the time teenagers do break these laws and sometimes get away with getting in trouble or even driving while drunk. Some of these people get lucky because when they are at parties they tend to stay long and when they see the time, they want to rush home before the curfew and that's how most tenagers get pulled over by speeding.

This is one of the most common ways to get pulled over around these times becuase cops are always looking for speeders. But a lot of teenagers really like being out and having fun with their friends on the weekends to where they can party and when they are in the moment, they never think about what could happen next because of how much fun they are having.

Next, if all these teenagers were to listen to the law and do what they are told a lot of these drinking and driving accidents would not be happening. It is crazy how most of these drinking and driving accidents come from teenagers and it can be avoided when these curfews comes into effect. Once these laws come into efect it can save a lot of lives and keep a lot of us safe from being harmed from mistakes that can be easily avoided by how long you are outside. A lot of the tenager's love having fun, but the problem comes when they want to have to much fun, to when they don't know when to stop and that's when the problem occurs, and they don't know about the consequences that come with it.

Based on this argument I think this is beatifical for us teenagers because, I think this council for curfews can save a lot of teenagers lives because of how dangerous it can be in those hours and these curfews can help a lot of people still have fun and be safe at the same time if they just follow the rules and listen to what they are being told.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,7.0,7.8826727867126465,8

Sometimes student do not sleep as well, or they do not have much energy to play, because they do not eat before start the game. Everybody needs to know before they have a game we need to eat healthy, and drink enough water. Sometimes famous death for that kind of reason, so we need to learn about the experience. Life is very important for everybody, so we need to look what's the first thing we can do before they think and act too.

Family is more important than the game, so they do not have time to practice. Sometimes family want to explore places for example; New York, Florida, and Boston that state has beautiful place to swim play, and we can do everything. That's why student do not have time to practice the game. Game is an important thing they can learn too much, and maybe in the future they can get a award like a professional or famous on games.

Some students do not have time to practice, because they need to work to pay the bills for example; pay the insurance for the car, pay the rent where they live, and also pay the bill for the cellphone. That's is the reason we do not have time to practice. That's why we failure the game, because we work at night and then we are going to school all day. When it is time to practice the game we do not have energy to play, so that is the cause we lost the game every time. We needed to work a part-time on that way we got more time to practice the game, so the next time we can win the game. Sometimes the family do not help them, because they said we need to learn how they make a money to obtain the food for each person.

Eating healthy is good for everyone, so we need to eat every day. Also we can eat fruit every time, because that has to much protein. That's is the first thing we can do before beat the team, because that make they strong. they need to go the gym too, because that help you to get a healthy body. Sometimes the first thing we can do is eating, and then go to sleep this is not a good choice for them.

Please help all the students who is trying to work and continuing to go to school, because they are the future on the world. We need to help them because sometimes we have a dream, but no body try to help that's why students can't realized they dreams. If they can continuing to study in the future they can earn to much money, because in the past it was hard for them, but now is more easily then the first time when they start                             ",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,6.0,6.014641284942627,6
94C1C9CD10B7,"'If the school adds one hour and thirty minutes in a schools day'' honestly i dont agree nor disagree their some pros and con with this topic. The pros are that you learn more its good because schools get out earlier for the summer so their more summer days to enjoy. Another pro is if you have question on your homework the teacher can help you out by teaching you and you dont have to worry about the time because you have plenty of minutes to learn. Second If their were longer classes kids will lean more things and pay attention,if its their favorite class well it will be good for them because its longer. For me I love music class if i have more time in that class i could learn more things about music and i could be better player. Third pro it give us more time to hang out with our friends because your could be busy because they sports or church. Well for me i cant hangout with my friends because i have strict parents they wont let me get out of the house unless i have good also they don't let me hang out with friends so the only way i can see them is at school. Fourth pro is you can get to know your teacher and the students in the class you can learn many new thing about the teacher that you would never know about sometime its cool to hear their story because it could teach you something or can make you laugh. So i learn that their many good thing of having more time in a school day.

The cons of having one hour and thirty minutes in school day. First con is kids will be tired and they wont think that much or pay attention because all their energy is gone. The kids will be rude and wont do anything because they are tired or hungry. Well the only way to fix this to give them snack yeah that could help but how your going get the snack you have to buy them with money they are going to tell the kids to buy the snacks and the schools wont buy it. Second con is if the kid has doctor appointment they will go and the next day they will miss a lot of stuff in class and they make it up and the teacher wont teach it again because they have to move on and learn something new. Third con is classes will be harder because you have remember a lot of stuff for the test that your going to have that week. Honestly for me everyday when i get home i take a nap if dont have that nap i will be mad all night so many other kid could be just like me when they dont get a nap they are really rude so that bad for them ant the teachers also you will see kids falling asleep and teacher will yell at them. So i learn that their many not so great things of having more time in school.

In the end they are many good like getting help for work and their may bad things like getting tired. So having more time in school is good and bad .    ",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,7.0,5.4899163246154785,5

88FA9C1FF56D,"Dear Principal,

I think that it is unfair that kids cant have sports or activities the one reason i say this is because sports and activities is not stopping kids to learn. I think if you take away sports it will hurt children because if the kid would like to be a football, basketball, soccer

player he/she couldn't achieve that goal because the school is taking away sports and activities. I think that you should have these sports but kids with a d-f should not be able to participate in the sport or activity, so if a child is really interested he/she will step up and do what he/she can do to improve his/her grade. When your a student you just want to express yourself and have time off to join sports and games. Kids enjoy this and if you take this opportunity away from them they will be very upset. Sports and activities can also help you get into the college you would like to go to because when a child is joining a sport lots of college professors want to see that. Another thing i would like to point out is that lots of kids would like to have a prep rally and see there friends and family play that sport. Sense i am a student here i would dislike not having to play sports or do activities. When kids play a sport it takes there stress away and hypes them up so taking a sport opens there minds. Children this age just want fun and games so i do think this might be to much credit for them but it still wont be fair for the students not being able to become what they want to be when there older, Also being a student your in school for about eight hours and after school people would enjoy doing what they love and go to there sports and or activities. I would like to say thank you for your time and effort i hope you understand.",4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8.0,7.100314140319824,7
CE43CDF8BAA4,"Social Media,Technology,and Education. The World around us is a beautiful place , but we do not take notice.

The smart phones play a vital role in today's society , it is the hobby of the century. The schools are now taking the advantage of the new technology , but along with the new use comes new problems.

Although, using the technology in schools becomes a faster way to learn , most schools are relying in the new invention of the century. Nevertheless, distraction in the schools will be a problem, also the students will be less perceptive in class because the students will fail to maintain self control over their devices and the results will be disastrous in their future.

To begin, the students in the school should have all the things they need to learn such as books, they should not rely on the devices to give them certain information. For example, the internet has a wide variety of information which could have a negative or a positive impact on the user , also the information in the web is very inaccurate which could lead to misunderstanding. This shows that the students could gain wrong information and could be getting a misconception in the topic , which could lead to failure in academics and to achieve nothing in their future careers. Clearly, the user have to make a wise decision between using an information in their cell phones that could possibly be wrong, or use a textbook that it is revised by many authorized teachers.

Further more, in today's society there is social media which is use to stay in touch with close family members who are far away. Cell phones are a great tool for anything , it is a mini computer. The students will be using their cell phones in social media to talk to friends instead of focusing on their task. For instance, if the school allowed such action, not only will be making a very poor decision but the school will earn a bad reputation from parents and even to the national level. This proves that it will not only hurt the kids academically but the school itself will have a downfall in popularity. Obviously, the teachers and staff will be unemployed by the county due to the lack of income from the state , teachers but not only students will be damaged by the decision that could be taken.

Overall, having the ability to own a cell phone is a privilege to have not a right , teachers and administrators should take away the device from the student if and only if the student is not cooperating, and return it at the end of the school day or simply not bring it to school. The devices were not made to harm others in many ways that people have tried .Social media plays a role too in the students it is like a temptation in their pockets , they always have to update their status in social media and text their friends and stay off task. In conclusion, Cell phones are a great way to study and do some homework and stay in touch with family members but in school is a learning place where it should stay like that and cell phones should not take that away.

A2EF5BCC488B,"Some people think that when they master at something they've never mastered at, then they will grow up. That is what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote. ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

An example of this statement are babies starting to walk. Then they achieve at it, then they will start talking. From that point on, they will grow into toddlers where they will learn about letters, numbers, how to share with others, and some easy words to pronounce. When they get to kindergarten, they will learn about math, reading, and writing. Upon growing into teenagers, they will learn about harder math skills like harder math, reading, and they will even apply for a job. When they grow into 10th graders, they will learn about business, marketing, and learning to drive. A similar experience I had was when I was starting Automotive Technology was when I learned about how to operate tools like wrenches, ratchets, how to lift up and carry things like tires, how to use safety equipment, and how to operate electric tools like machines, impact guns, and drills. It was scary at first, but overtime, I've been continually practicing using these tools, and now I'm an expert at using these equipments. Another experience I had was when I was doing chores like cleaning, vacuuming, washing the dishes, and taking out the trash. I can do these chores without having a family member like my mom asking me to do it.

Another reason why Emerson's quote is correct is because if you continue practicing at something you've neve excelled at, you excel at it, then you will continue mastering at it. It will make people happy that they achieved at it. A similar experience I had was when I was in my elementary school years when I was eating dinner with my family. Back then, I used to eat a lot, and that is still true today. I would finish almost everything from meat, soup, etc. My family was impressed at how much I've eatan. As a result, I grew so much that I was taller than most of my family members, and it's still true today. I continue to eat a lot and I will eat more in my future. Another experience I had was in elementary school. In elementary school, I learned about mathematics from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Back then, it was a little tough at first, but I kept practicing, and now I can excel at this.

In contrast of Emerson's quote, if people keep practicing, but they don't seem to achieve it, it might make them feel upset and defeated. However, to remedy that, if people continue practicing at something challenging, there is a higher chance that they will achieve at it. It will certainly make people joyful that they achieved it.

As Emerson said in his quote, if you try your best or master at something you've never excelled at, then you will grow up and feel joyful about it. By continually practicing, you will most likely achieve at it.",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,7.0,8.497533798217773,8

The people need the contact for comunication with the other human for to do more technology and for that can to do more games the people need to do more imformation for to do more something for comunication with the other human for pay the games without speaking with other person my idea is that they have more contact with the other companies for have good idea and together going to have good imformation and they need take good idea.

3AFA78FFFC15,"So I would be talking about how people should sign up for something at there own school because people should do something they love thats my first reason. Everyone should be doing something its not like your doing it serious but sports is hard in my opinion because you have to be really good at that sport thats my second reason. Not to be on the electronics all day that would'nt be good at all compare that doing something all the time. But people should do something in there lives because you only live once so do something. Thats why agree to this so people would'nt all that because if you really love something or sport then you should make dreams come true so your good at it that is all I have to say about people should do something activity at school or sport.

Reason number one love something then do it because people should believe what they do also some people dont believe in there self they just knock there self down like believe that your good at it. What if there really good at what they do like people should follow there dreams by being good in that one activity or sport they love. We need really great people to do something dont be doing stuff you really dont like because u dont need to do something it dont make sense. This paragraph was about how to do something you actually wanna do and believe what you really love about your school like dont just sit down and relax like do something in your life its apart of life too.

Reason number two everyone should do something in there lives should'nt be lazy because that would'nt take you no where when your all lazy and stuff dont do work or anything. Do sports and activity so your body could be healthy because a lot of sports will take you some where. Probably professional sports that would be really great for you like big time. Be active al the time so your could help your own body it could probably grow like that and thats all I have to say about my second reason.

Reason number three is not to be in electronics all day long because its a distractions to others you need to practice what your doing in a activity. Be home all day you should really play outside with friends or make plans during the weekend because it would be fun for you and your friends. won't have much sleep at night because if your just distracted about being on your phone all the time you'll probably be tired in school or even at practice or after school. So you shouldnt be on the phone all day your play outside go to the movies or chores doing something doesnt get you bored all the time. So this paragraph was about you should stay off your electronics all the time not all but sometimes just go outside and play.

Thats all my reason I hope that a lot of people try something that there good at. People try something new in life because life is'nt easy at all but you just got to fight for it and be at anything. We all should try something new it would be amazing for other some people got people to look up. To so look up to someone its good because there probably a great person with a great heart. You should look up to others because other people made a big accomplishment. So thats all I have to say about being a leader not a follower like do something once again u only live once make ur life go big.    ",2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,5.0,5.423605918884277,5
35CF1B2B1326,"I think, with that changing 4 days of work in a week have disadvantages and some benefits. because people will not have time to live their normal life or do work at home, they will use the same amount of energy and resources and people will not support to work many hours in a day.

In addition, people have already their own routine to work, even thought if some busines try to change work days.

To began,

people will not have time to share with their family, also working 4 day a week for 10 hours will cause problem in your family, children in those time do not have enough responsibility to be home by their self, even thought, people will not have time to do work at home. For example; to clean their house, to go work after school and to coexists their problems or thoughts with the family. And to do other works at the end of the day.

Second, working 10 hours a day they will use the same quantity of energy and resources because is the same sum of hours that all people work, if they work 8 hours a day for 5 day, even that people may use more energy, because the rest of the week people will need energy, as well to work 10 hours a day will use the same amount of resources, to make up all the works that you need to do.

Lastly, people will not support working 10 hours a day, because many people have their routine to work, or some of them have problems working to many hours, another reason why people can not work 10 hours a day is that they have their own routine work, as well student in school will not support to be in class. For example many student gets bored in class juts been 8 hours in school and if we compare there will be a lot if issue with their attendance. another point is many student work to support their self, so in that occation they will not available to work and make money.

To conclude, to work 10 hours a day is to hard for many people and they will try to work less hours in a day, because they can not have time to share with the family, also they can get sick for being working to many hours. even thought on this times some people worked 10 hours a day, but at the end of all that working to much can cause serious problems with your health.

Because Students will no have enough sleep with one and a half hours extra of school with homework,

also students will have less free time, and also student wouldn't have enough time to go spend with there family.

If the school board extended the school day by one hour and a half then students wouldn't have enough time to sleep because they have to do there homework , and that take probably one to two hours to finish there homework and then they will have to eat and get ready for bed.

Do you like spending time with your family I like spending time with family but if the school board extends the school day by one hour and a half then you wont have as much time to be and spend with your family like going outside for a walk or playing games or going out places like to eat and those times are going to be making memories not being in school most of the time.

Thats why I think students shouldn't have school extended one hour and a half so they can have more time to do there homework and have more time to sleep, and so that they can have enough time to play video games and play outside with there friends , and finally so they can spend time with there family and do fun activities with them.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,6.0,6.240114212036133,6
C5784E7398EC,"Schools should have no right to decide what choices, a student`of them takes after a long 7 hours period. Local School should only worried when his or her students is taking wrong choices inside. Most Students are advanced and most of the time homework dose not really affect them. Every parents want there child to do good in school and with activities out there that can help is gladly helpful and deffenly to lighten and enrich their educational experiences. When it comes to the outside world school should not get involved to what parent decide for there child goals.

Schools should only make sure there students are safe inside and learning for the better. When School comes to an end, its all hands on parents to decide what they want for there child. Every parents want the better for their child and more education the better to enriched the mindful brain. Its great when a child is bright and full with education that can for sure help him when hes grown. I believe schools should not even get in between in the decision that are made by parents and this is why, Different kids, Different goals and Different future.

According to some scientist that research the brain from UAV they said 'Those Students that listen and pay attention in class, remember about what they was thought and have good grade, most of the time they dont do home work and still pass this is the thoughtful brain helping them remember.' All it matter is that the students is getting his education and up to him and his family what more hes trying to learn. Students can deffenly learn much more with special activities that can be helpful when it comes to education they can learn new job and courses. Local School should not get involved with students involvement in extra activities.

FA08CD5A2E48,"Sometimes when you are not doing anything or just do not do something physical, some good or great things could happen surrounding you and the world.

My first idea that makes inactivity a ""self work"" in progress. Meaing letting people around help you instead of you doing everything yourself. A movie called ""Christopher Robin"" shows that as a child, Christopher did things before but he had imaginary animals helping him.

The purpose of the movie, is to give the auidience the understanding of what it means to be always doing something, always occupy yourself with the simplest things that you do not really have to do. And adding pressure on yourself. Than letting others help you, can create good things surrounding you and you can have good thoughts. Because when you are stressed you are worried about how things will be in the future. Having people help you can still have great success that can be accomplished.

The example or message in this movie shows when Christopher is an adult and he pre-occupys himself a lot, the more problems is caused with his life. He almost lost his wife and daughter because he was always occupied doing his business job. Later when he realizes he was on the wrong track, his friend, pooh was telling him he is not the same as himself before. He told himself the only way he'll be less stressed and worried is to become the child inside him and bloom once more. Letting your inside child out, he needs to find himself doing absolutely nothing, no stress, and just spend time with the life he has been given and his family. After doing that, he was more gifted than before, like this idea he had for how to make his business better but had never presented because he was always doing something

Like the thesis was talking about not doing something physical could lead to some good or great things, Christopher found himself at the end. He is happy and relaxed with what he accomplished when he let go and did nothing. Now he realizes the result of doing nothing and how different it would have been if he kept on occupying himself in things he should not be worried about rather than enjoying what he has to thank for. So the key is that if Christopher Robin can accomplish great or good things by doing nothing rather than doing something, then that means everybody else can learn as well the understanding to find success and move ahead.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,7.0,6.812046051025391,7
C24F3DD7A37E,"What are some benefits of having a good attitude, even in a difficult time? A good attitude can make people successful even in a difficult time. But not always people have a good attitudes, and sometimes affects them. A good attitude makes people strong, and to always have positive thoughts and emotions. Having a good attitude helps people to be more intelligent and to face their problems. It is important to have a good attitude because people can face their obstacles, it gives them many opportunities and experiences to learn.

Nobody is perfect in the world, everyone has obstacles to face forward. But having a good attitude can help them to face their obstacle, it help them to never give up, like famous actors of movies, shows, and many more. Before they came to be famous they face their obstacles to be someone in life. They past through many things to be came successful, but they face them with a good attitude and yep sometimes with bad attitudes. Some actors still have some obstacles to face, but they face them with good attitudes.

On the other hand, having a good attitude gives people many opportunities. People often have opportunities but they don't know how to confront them. A positive attitude helps people in their life because it gives them many opportunities, like

Generic_Name,

the mother of a girl, who had face many problems in her life. She never give up and she always was with a positive attitude, when Generic_Name was 30 years old, one of her son's died from Cancer. At that time Generic_Name was very upset, but an opportunity appear on her life. She decides to take the opportunity with a good attitude. Generic_Name always has a positive attitude even during in a difficult time.

Otherwise, having a good attitude gives people many experiences. Experiences appears in people life so they can learn from them, but having a good attitude makes then more fun and interesting. One of the experiences that learn is that when you give money or food to a homeless they shared it with other homeless with a positive attitude. They think about others, even when they don't have to much. A person once said, When give more, you receive more, that is true because when the homeless shared something with others they receive more but they wait with a positive attitude is like they feel happy, they have a good attitude but at the same not all of them have a positive attitude some of them have a negative attitude because they had a hard time.

Overall, having a good attitude can help people anywhere in the world. A good attitude help people in their future they have obstacles to face, opportunities to take, and amazing experiences to learn. Sometimes people imagine their life with having a bad attitude, and everything that they have will be rare because they will not have the chance to learn or to experience. To the contrary of people with good attitudes are awesome because they are intelligent and they have an incredible wisdom. A good attitude is important because even when people have a difficult time they can face them.    ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,7.0,7.5793375968933105,8

Failure is inavoidable the path to success is not straight one.

everyone fails sometime in their life .

Walt disney was fired for a newspaper because he lacked creativity.

Learn from your mistakes, if you make a mistake at least you know not to do it again.

A failure might put an end to one thing (idea or opportunity) but lead you to other for example: I used to try to draw realistic people and animals with pensils, and then I found that i was better at zentangle (an art style that consists of repetitive designs and patterns. The success you end up having might not be the kind you originally had in mind. Failures could lead you into in something else entirely.

Failure often leads to problem, working to solve problems and getting through difficult times makes you smarter and stronger as a person. By dealing with your failures, you will be more prepared and experienced in the fututre. Strength, intelligente, problem solving skills, and experience are all thing that are gained from faiture and can lead to success.

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that success consists of going from faiture to faiture without loss of enthusiasm. I think that faiture Plays a crucial role during the pursuit of success.

If there were not mistakes in life. Then no one would learn from then. Faiture is unavoidable, but it can be a useful tool that helps shape your future.

My conclusion is Faiture can change who you are and what path you're on in life, and I believe that it plays an important role in the persuit for success.

Mistake only makes us smarter and working to solve problems only makes us stronger.

60A495340620,"When you see someone what are your first impressions? Is it possible to change that? Many say it's impossible, but is it? I agree with this statement because a first impression is basically judging someone without meeting them. You're judging them based on what they are wearing or how they look which triggers your mind to have a first impression.

First impressions cannot always be a good one so it is not necessary to change it. For example: Somebody first impression towards you can be, ""oh she looks like a mean and a disrespectful person"", but you know your a very caring and a kind person. Lets say you went up to go talk to that person, the person who gave you a a bad impression. They get scared and a little nervous when you approach them. You notice it. Their first impression towards you changes their emotions or the way you act. Sometimes having a first impression about someone isn't a good idea to be thinking about. You need to learn if they are really what you think they are. It is possible that your first impressions are correct, but theres a higher percent chance it's wrong

Changing your first impression towards someone you haven't even met or know nothing about them is impossible to change. Your mind is your mind. You are controlling it. You tell it what to do or what to think about. You cannot change anything in your mind that you've already thought about. especially your first impressions towards people. Changing your first impression about someone is like changing a light bulb that works with another light bulb that also works. Changing it doesn't change what you had at first. You already thought about your first impression about someone. You cannot change the past or change what your already had thought about.

Some people might say it is possible to change your first impressions, but they are wrong because how can you change the past when it already happened. For example: you see a girl and in your head you say ""wow she looks like she steals"", but later on you say, ""oh I don't think that she steals anymore"". Your first impression was that you think she steals, but your mind finds out your first impression was wrong because you started to learn more about then, so your mind shifts to a different point of view towards them. Your first impression will always be your first impression. It's like having your first relationship. Whether you don't like them or not that person will always be your first relationship.

To conclusion changing your first impression is impossible. It's in the past. If it's impossible to change the past then it's impossible to change your first impression.                                           ",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,3.5,8.0,7.45388126373291,7

EA03135D3C88,"Student-designed

Wouldn`t it be exciting for a student to create a summer projects for their fellow students to do during summer break? Summer break is a time for students to have fun with their families and friends. It a time to travel to so many places like Generic_City, Florida, California, and so forth. Furthermore, it`s great for students to complete summer projects during their break so their brains and memories can still be refreshed and for them not to forget most of the school materials they have learned before summer break. Moreover, requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is a brilliant idea. But these summer projects should be student-designed because the projects will be exciting, students will be more engaged with the projects, and the student-designed projects will definitely be less harder.

The first reason the summer projects should be a student-designed is because the projects will be exciting and enjoyable for other students. For example, when a students designs a Kahoot for their fellow students to use to study for their test and quizzes, it will be exciting just because the students will get to choose any names they wish. So, a Kahoot is a game that teachers use to create a test or quizzes for students to study to get them prepared for their test and quizzes. The Kahoot can be used inside and outside of the school premises. The student designing the kahoot will get to choose how many seconds or minutes it should take the students to answer their questions. Also, most teachers don`t give students enough time for them to choose their answers and that is unfair. Students needs more time at least 20 to 30 seconds to think about the questions before answering and not rush to choose any answer just because the teacher didn`t give them enough time. Students complain about how much time teachers give them because they need more time to work on their projects. For instance, teachers design boring projects like making a word puzzel about math. That is so boring because no students wants to spend their time making a word puzzle about math instead of doing other fun things like reading, going to the movie theater, going on vacation, and spending time with their families and friends. Most of the students don`t find math interesting beccause they don`t like doing math.

Another reason is that students will be more engaged with the projects. For instance, a student designed a project about each students choosing their own topic argumentative essay like increasing the minimum wage, the college tuition, and discrimination. After that, the student will design another projects about presentations. The presentation will teach them how to present to their fellow students and also how to present in future times like jobs. The presentation will also help them master the skills of presenting. When a student designs the projects, the student will give the students extra time to work on it because teachers will give students less time on their project and expect the students to be prepared when they are not. Furthermore, the students will decide if they need to present to teachers because most students are nervous to do that. And also they have not mastered the skill of presenting yet. The students will also decide how many words will be in each slides, how many slides they need, and how many minutes they need to present. Most of the times, teachers give students less time to present. Due to the less time, students won`t be able to finish what they have in mind or what they have to say and they will have to be rushed to finish before time is over. And if the students didn`t reach the time given or went over the time given, points will be deducted. But when the students chooses how they want their presentations to be, they are more likely to work on it more than when a teacher tells them how to do their own presentations.

The third reason is because the student-designed project will be less harder for students to do. For example, there was a project my history teacher assigned us to do, it was a project about the Progressive Era to make sure that we understand what it was all about. We had to come up with a creative title and 3 categories for the project. It was hard for us to do because we had to come up with a creative title that connects with the topic and 3 categories that 20 sub-heading can fit on one of them. If it was a student designed the project, it would be less harder because either the title is given to us, or we don`t have to create one. And also the 3 categories will be given to use to make it a little more easier. Then all we have to do is put the 20 sub-heading in their right categories and also insert some images where it suppose to be. Another example was when my AVID teacher gave a project about researching the college of our choice. It`s great that we had to choose the college of our choice, but the questions and the rubric was unclear. They were almost the same question and it was difficult for us to answer it because we couldn`t give the same answer to all the questions. Even though some people say that teacher-designed will be so much better because students will tend to take it seriously than a student-designed; however, student-designed is better because its made by a student and it will less stressful, while teacher-designed will be a lot harder and frustrating to do.

In conclusion, student-designed is better because its more fun, engaging, and easier to do than teacher-designed. Students need more time towork on their projects while spending time with families and friends. It`s great to have fun while learning and not stress out over a project during summer break. Schools need to give students an opportunities for them to design a projects for their follow students, and to show their skills and talents. ",4.5,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,9.0,8.04903507232666,8
2D7557DCE6AF,"Have you ever heard the saying,"" If you want to make it somewhere in life, you have to start with yourself."" In this case, that saying can relate a quit bit to the statement

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. Everyone in the world has their own talent, dream, and goal. Other's master things differently, but question is, exactly how ? Giving up, doubting yourself, and not being motivated will honestly not take you or anyone else in the right path to success. So, the statement Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote was motivating. So he says, "" Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" That should at least open the eyes of some folks.

Many people lack when it comes down to knowing who they want to be in future. Im not saying it's easy but, someone needs to start somewhere, somehow. For an example, my uncles friend lost his sister at the age of fourteen from a tragic event. His sister death lead to many unhealthy actions in the household. The destruction did not only affect him but, his parents as well. At the age of sixteen he decided to honor his sister, and reunite the family once again. So, one day he joined the wrestling team at his high school. My uncles friend admits he wasn't the best in the team but, he worked hard so that when it came down to the other wrestling teams he could be undefeated. He didn't only set that as a goal for himself but, the death of his sister was a huge motivational push of accomplishing that goal.

Being confident does not only make you feel good physically but , emotionally as well. On the other hand,doubting yourself seems to be more easy when your not really sure if things are going to come out right or wrong. For an example, when a teacher is giving a lesson he or she may ask the students to give a response to the question the teacher may have asked. Let's say a student wasn't really sure if their response was going to be correct so they wait on another student to answer it for them. What if the student that gave the teacher the answer was correct,

the student that was doubting their self may go back and think to themselves; "" I should've said it myself."" This happens to everyone including me but, sometimes you have to be a little confident even if your wrong, you can always learn from your mistakes and use your mistakes as a tool to do better.

Do you really think giving up is the right thing to do ? In my opinion, giving up is for losers if you want to get somewhere in life you need to strive to do your best at all times. As a result , giving up brings you to no good. It's like running around the track and you made it to three laps and let's say you had to do one more to finish a grand prize of 1,000 dollars. Are you really going to give up those 1,000 for NOT RUNNING ONE MORE LAP! Giving up is not the answer at all, pushing yourself , picking yourself up is the right answer. Sometimes you have to go through obstacles to get where you need to be.

To conclude, I strongly agree with the statement of Author Ralph Waldo Emerson. Theirs times when you need to add a little confidence instead of doubting yourself , push yourself hard enough until you need to get where you want to be, instead of giving up,

and most of all use your weakness as a tool to motivate you to find you purpose in life.    ",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,8.0,8.432599067687988,8
3954DF9C83CD,"Do you think high school should be three years or four years? should students go to college with three years? how do students get enough credit for three years? why do people go to summer school or night school? I say taking high school for three years is not a good idea Some peolpe say that it help if you take four years rather than three.

The first time i went to high school i knew that i wanted to graudate in fours years so i can have alot of time by my side to get everything done, because i knew that if i failed a class then i had to retake it again. So i wanted to have enough time to make up any classes or SOL that i have taken, so i can graudate on time with my friend and classmates. It's really stressful when you think about it beacuse you know that if you mess up you either don't pass or you don't graudate on time which kind of bad,it's makes you fee like you have a goal to make when you enter high school to pass all classes/ SOL then graudate on time.

People take the advantage to go to summer school and night classes to have the credits they need. When I was a sphomore i had to take summer school for algbrea,it was much better to take summer classes beacuse you really didn't have worried about the credit or how many classes you have during regular school. You just had to focus in one class, to me like it beacuse we had one class to focus on it made it feel a little stress free. I

had freinds who had to take night classes, they told me that taking night classes were the same as taking summer school but the only differences one is during the summer. It's nice to take summer school and nights classes because you have enough time to pass the class and get the credit, plus it give you more time to have all of the fun classes to take when you have all of the credits.

Taking fours years in high school gives you the opportunity to experiances the high school life, for instances you have all the school sprit. I'm talking about the football games, the pep-rallys, homecoming, and prom. you get to experiences that, it's the best feeling beacuse you know when you are a senior in high school you will always be part of your your school's familes no matter what. After high school you don't get to live the high school experiences anymore you have to become an adult.

Most people say that having three years is better than fours years because it is much faster rather than taking four years beacuse how slow it will take. But honestly it always going to feel fast weather you are taking four years. But in the futrue i hope that some high schoolers will choose to stay all four years just for the experiences of living like a high schooler and what it feels to have that one last chances of being a kid before you go out into the real world.

You follow the voice and end up in the middle of the mall where a girl is singing her heart out and playing the guitar. Then all of a sudden you find a interest in singing and playing the guitar. Everyone has a talent or skill and some people use it everyday.

Here are some talents people use everyday like singing, playing the guitar, playing the piano, being a magician, and being a comedian. A lot of people sing for a living and its so cool how they sing. My favorite singer is Shawn Mendes and the way he uses his voice is so cool and beautiful. Playing the guitar is a everyday thing for some people too like some singers play the guitar or some people just play the guitar without singing at all and it sounds so beautiful that it makes me feel relaxed listening to people play. Also Playing the piano is very fun and exciting and some people who play calm and peaceful music I love when they do that. I always thought magicians are cool and mind blowing I just dont get how they do there tricks. Every time i watch a magician on Americas Got Talent i'm always on the edge of my seat by the end of the episode. Finally comedians are so fun to watch they make me laugh so much that I'm always in tears. Sometime when i think the persons so funny I laugh so much that my stomach starts hurting right after.

These are some everyday skills people use like being very good in math, being organized, playing a sport, getting straight A's every time, and doing makeup looks. Most people are good at doing math and solving problems. It take effort in being good at something. Math is a very hard subject and i dont know how people do. Im kinda good in math but not that good like others. Being organized is a hard thing to do. A lot of people arent organized. It takes time, a lot of responsibly, and patience to be organized. Playing a sport is hard because you have to have a lot of skills and be athletic to play. Like Ice hockey is very hard because you have to have a good and strong balance in order to skate on the ice. Getting straight A's every time is not that easy I've tried before and im still trying. You have to believe in yourself and tell yourself you can do it. you need to have a lot of effort and study a lot in order to reach this goal in life.

Social media is a big thing in the world like Instagram, snapcaht, tik tok, twitter, facebook etc. A lot of people post on those social media apps there skill or there talent.

My talent or skill is baking. I bake all the time. Whenever I get home after school i bake whatever I'm craving. I found out about my talent when i saw my dad making delicous, fluffy, and moist cupcakes for his catering i asked him if i could help him with the order and he said ""yes""! ever since then i Bake almost everyday. Its so fun baking it calms me down and gets my mind off of things. Whenever I'm bored i start baking i know im addicted to baking! I make cakes, cupcakes, truffles, etc. My dad gets so excited when i bake he says whatever i make is gonna be good no matter what. Thats my talent, baking.

6B56C630FFC5,"Principal

This is my opinion of your future change in the school activities. I'm not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students don't have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they can't play anymore, till they make a good grade.

This change can do a good change because the students that play a sport or if they are in the band, and if they care more in the activity that they play, maybe that can be distorting the student, that can be the reason of why they don't have good grades, so the students what the students have to study at the same with their sport or other activity, and be good with both. Maybe the students are better in their activity because sometimes we have more fun, and because we like to be in more movement. I have to tell that the idea of tell us about this cange and for give us the opportunity to let us tell you, our opinion is good.",2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,5.0,5.658960819244385,6
4B8BFC292EF5,"Students should be able to decide in which extracurricular activities they want to join and the amount of extracurricular activities they want to chose.

First of all, this will help the students learn how to menage their time in the best possible way. It will also help the students relax their minds and exercise their body's as well. If students were able to join more than one activities or they could chose any extracurricular activities they wanted, students will be more exited to go to school and to do their work. Therefore, they could go to join the activities they like. This means that their attendance will get better and their grades will go up.

If teachers controlled the extracurricular activities, they will tell the students how many activities they could join so they could have more time to study or do their homework but, this doesnt means the students will use their other time to study or do their homework . Some students wouldn't like that. Which means that they would stop joining the extracurricular activities.

In conclusion schools should give the students freedom for them to decide in what they want to spend their time on. These wouldn't affect the students because they will also have time to study and do their homework.

07C6BB6ADA38,"One topic that is frequently debated today is schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would be benefit to student or not. Some people believe school should offer this program for students that need time for their morning routine. They feel that it would help students for do not need to have to wake up early and go to school. I believe distance learning program that school offer for students would not be benefit to students because students will not have a skill to communicate with other people, it will make students have less enthusiasm, and some students family did not have no internet or device to watch the video online teaching.

One reason why schools should not offer the distance learning program because it would make student get less skill from communicate with other people. When students go to school they will meet friends have a communication with each other or talk to their teacher. Communication is an important for every type of jobs. Communication is one of the most important thing that should have inside the lesson because every job or every company will hiring people that have good skill to communication with other people. Communication is almost every where inside the school but if school have to consent to have the distance learning program, it will affect to student to get a job by taking students away from their communication with other people.

Another reason why schools should not offer the distance learning program because it will make students have less enthusiasm to learn. Every morning students have to wake up early and get ready for school is one of the practice thing that will let student get ready for outside the world. Enthusiasm is one of the most thing that will help students to have more responsibility to their job or their self. Lack of the enthusiasm will make students have a lack of responsibility to their job or their self. However, if school consent the distance program it will make student get a lack of the enthusiasm and it will make students get lack of the responsibly to take care even them self.

Final reason why schools should not offer the distance learning program because some students did not have device or Internet at home to watch the online or video conferencing. There are many family that did not have the Internet at home and they will not be able to attend the classes at home and will not be able to watch the online or video conferencing. It will not be fair to the outer family that do not have a internet or device to get into the online or video conference to the family that have the internet or device to use. Therefore, school should not consent the distance learning program to make all the students equally.

As you have read, I believe distance learning program that school offer to students would not be benefit to students and affect to students by take students to the bad position. School is the learning place for students to get a knowledge. If we are going to have only the online teaching, school will not exist. Only when we value the learning in class, communicating with friends, and being equal with other we will feel that school is a good place for studying and getting the knowledge. On that day the world will better to have school full with students that have a good knowledge and ready for out world.",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,6.0,6.135766983032227,6
E2687856AA7D,"School districts should not allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Those programs force the students to take summer or evenings courses, don't allow them to take elective classes, or students might not have the time that they need to be prepared for college. This information can help students to think more about their decitions, and have a successful life.

Summer, or evening courses can always be stressful for some students. Sometimes, they will not have time for family activities, or they might not have the opportunity to get involved in sports that they like, which is a good way to spent time with other students. It is also very important to know that students need time to rest, a free time when they can sleep and release the tiredness.

The elective courses during the school year should be available for all the student that wish to improve their knowledge. For example, learning other kind of things can encourage students to think about more ideas for their future, and develop new skills on many activities. Taking away the opportunity of students to choose any of elective courses, and forcing them to complete all the hard classes that they need is not a good solution. That will make students to force themselves to do hard work, which can end up in a failing situation.

In other words, its very important for students to be prepared for college. Also students should have the sufficient time to prepare, and choose the career that they really want. If in case students are not sure about what career they want, four year of High School should be enough time to learn more about carrers. For example, students will have more opportunities to attent college day also, they could go visit, and get information about any college that they are interedted on. Being well prepared is the best key to bulid a good future nad accomplish dreams.

This decition should be made by the school district to eliminate this programs, and let the students have a comfortable schedule for thier everday activities. spending more time at home with family, and refreshing their minds it's better than summer courses. Students should know that getting involved in elective classes is more fun, and bieng well prepared for college is more important. Even though students know it's going to be a longer way, it would benefit them in the future.        ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,3.5,8.0,7.422627925872803,7
7D9BF6C711FC,"Many people think that working in groups is better than working alone.

For example when you work in groups you get to divide the work with your partners.

Also a group can make better ideas and choices than someone who is working alone.

But i think that for those people who are self conscious, working in groups can make them meet more people and have fun.

What is more benificial working with a group or working alone.

When you work with groups it is more easily to get the work done by the time is due.

When you have big projects you can divide the work with your partners.

You do not have to stress about doing all the work.

If you have difficulty understanding something, than one of your partners can help you understand it.

The best part of working with groups is that if you run out of ideas than, they can help you out with getting new ideas.

A group can make better ideas because a group have different people thinking about ideas for the project.

The more ideas you get from your partners the better it is.

When working in a group someone might give a suggestion, The group can discuss if is a good theme or if it is not good for the project.

Working in groups is better because you can give ideas, many people might like the idea and some might not but if more people agree that it is a good idea for the project, Than the group can use the idea you gave.

Group work are better beacuse you and your partners are going to discuss if it is a good choice for the group to use the theme or the idea for the project.

Many people have differents ideas but the group together are going to discuss witch one are the best ideas for the project

I think that for those people who are self conscious, working with groups can help them to talk more people, stop being shy, and they can start having fun.

When you work on a group you get to do your work, but also you get to have fun and meet more people.

Group work can help a lot of people to meet more people.

Also it can help people do their work even faster and easier.

You can do two things at the same time when working with a group.

I do a better job when i do work with other people because i get to have fun and do my work at the same time.

In conclusion;

Is better to work with groups than alone.

When you are working with groups you are having fun and doing work faster and easier, while when you are working alone you are doing a lot of work by yourself and you are stressing about finishing on time.

Working in groups helps people meet more people.

Do fun stuff during the project.

I think teachers on this day should start giving more group work to their students so they can have fun, and they can do their project on time, and they dont have to be sttresing to much.

Career experience is important to human society because it is needed in order to earn money. Some school provide programs that have different career. Student can have experience on what is like in the outside world. Without the help of the school program lot of student have difficulty on finding jobs.

Graduating early means that a student have master they're learning. They have the opportunity to start there career that they enjoy and have the requirement. Pre-AP classes, also advance learning can give students scholarship. Pre-AP classes means learning College while in High School.

Recommendation also falls on the same place as graduating early and career experience. When a student have master there learning they get to go to a special school that is more advance than regular school. They have reach the point where they succeed in learning.

A3C8FABB8B29,"I think is a good, idea that students get different types of classes because that might help to choose their career. Its a really good idea knowing what you going to do with your life once you're done with high school. There are so many teens that once they are out high school they don't know what jobs they want to start and study for it. I think that thats why they should have many more classes that thats what its going to help them continue with their thinking of what career to choose once they gradute high school. for example classes that are for automotive technology is a confortable job in a way that you learn more about cars but in a way is dangerous at the same time because cars have so many heavy parts that could injured you. Another confortable job is being a lowyer lowyers don't do much other than being in the computer or doing paperwork in that cause you dont have to be outside in the cold working on a bad job that involves working in a construction site. And thats the main idea that schools should offer carrer choices that involves students in a carreer class that will teach them once they are out school and that the jobs will interest the students. There is so many students that drop out school because is not interesting to them but thats a bad idea of not going to school because if a student doesn't graduate they will be workingfor some restaurant not earning that much money and working so many hours thats why it is important for teens to stay in school so that the school could offer them on what job they will choose once they graduate high school. School is one of the most important places where they will teach students what decisions they should take on their life once they are adults. In some cases students start going to college once they are out school because they got an idea of how their class works and what for what job they are going to study.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,7.0,6.152525901794434,6
F610C7BCD9EC,"Technology seems to be becoming more and more important now. As the technology improves year by year, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But people have very different thoughts to this idea, then the problem comes. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Although some think students should attend classes from home, actually they shouldn't attend classes from home because students might be doing other things during the online class time. And students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends if they attend classes from home.

Those who believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons. They think it's much safer for students to take an online class at home. And they also believe it might be better for students to study under a quite environment.

One reason of why students shouldn't attend classes from home is that they might be doing other things during the online class time. An example of this would be my cousin, Generic_Name. He took an online class on the computer few months ago. In the beginning, he was so exciting because it was the first time for him to take a class at home. And his parents were happy to see that because it's difficult to send Generic_Name to school everyday, both of them had work to do. After a few weeks, Generic_Name got his first test grade of online study. It was much lower than the grade he used to get. I asked the reason later, he explained he was playing his cell phone during the class time and didn't pay attention. If he normally took classes in the school, I thought he would get at least a ""B"" in this test. He was smart,just too lazy to study. It's undeniable that online classes brought a lot of convinces to Generic_Name and his family, but it was not the best way to help him to improve his grade.

Another reason of why students shouldn't attend classes from home is that students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends. An example of this would be my friend, Generic_Name. Although he wasn't like to talk, he had a lot of friends in the school because he was nice to everyone. But everything has changed, since he attended classes from home . We didn't see him for a long time even the class was over. His parents told us he won't come to school anymore because he hated school. If Generic_Name took classes at school like before, he would meet more friends. I can't say if it's a bad choice to attend classes from home, but at least not the way for those students who wasn't like to talk.

In conclusion, although some think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, I believe students shouldn't attend classes from home. They should get more opportunities to communicate with their friends, and enjoy their short, but wonderful school life. ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,8.0,8.314047813415527,8
7333B4549006,"Conserving energy and resources is very benifical for human life and nature. Human damage many nature things while making energy and resources for their daily use. For example deforestation, use of water to make electricity, which can decrease the ammount of aquatic animals and water on the earth. Some buisness have adopted the idea of a four-day work week so they can conserve energy and resources. A four-day work week can also effect on thier buisness and put them in loss but it depends on them how they manage their work in four days. But Should schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours and make a four day school week? In my opinion school shouldn't follow this model. student's already have five- day school week which sometime seems very short, when students have lot of work to do and they need more help of teachers. In a month there are some federal holidays in weekdays, Which make a five- day school week more short. Extending the school day two hour and adopted a four-day work week have many disadavtages. It can put bad impact on students study and on thier grades, they will spend their weekend more with friends not with books, Students may spend their times on computer games and on phones. So, four-day school week will effect somewhere in student life. It's better to keep the five-days school week for students goods and for their better education.

Every student study hard in school to get better grades in all classes. Student's always try to learn more from their teachers and do their best in class. But a short week can a put bad impact on their study and their grades will go down. For example when students have an extra time in their classes, they mostly spend it with thier teachers and asking them questions so they can get answers in a specific way. But what if they don't have time in class or teacher's don't have time for student's. If a teacher has a short time to teach soemthing. They will teach in a very fast or a different way to students. Some student's may not get everything in class, and their class performance will go down and it impact on their grades. It's very important for a teacher to spend a time with their students and ask them about their problems in classes, and also for a students it's very important to share their problems with teacher so, they can find a way to solve the problems. It can only happens when student and teacher both have time in class to discuss. so the Four-day week can make a distance between a teacher and a student.

Second, Friendship is a very important thing in every person life, Friendship with a good friend can tell you the path of your success. Spending time with friends is a good habbit. But it doesn't mean that you have to spend you al free time with friends. Almost every studnt spend their weekends with their freinds and they dont care about school study. Even we spend our one school holidays with friends and forget about study. what if we have three days off in a week. Do we spend that time with our books? the answers is no we cannot spend time with books on weekends. We need to spend our times with books and the schhol is the only place where we can learn something and soend times with the books. For example Last week we had an five days off from school and i didn't study in that week and i forgot to complete an project i got bad grades on that class. i spent my time with my friends and i didn't know the meaning of study in that time that's why i got bad grade in that class. But when i have regular week of school i always complete my work first so i can keep my grades up. More school holiday's will give more tension to student that's why they didn't study at home and they would like to study at school. A regular school week is much better than four-day week of school because in a one day we can learn a lot from our teachers at school.

In this century every single person is using technology. Students are using more technolgy than others, spending time on computer and on phones isn't bad thing but you also have to spend some time with other activites like sports, cultural activites. But children doesn't want to do this and they play games on phones and on computers. For exaample I have a younger who's fourteen year old. Whenever he arrived at home from school, the first thing he do is get out his Laptop from his school bag and start playing games with his friends on online group so you can easily estimate that how many school student playing that game on computer and on phones on weekends and on off days. Playing game on wekends and on holidays can effect you and your studies and gives you a bad grades. It's better to be in school than on computer games, so we can learn something new. A four-day school week can make a big difference in student's school life.

At the end, I would say that if school will follow the model by extending school and a four-day school week. It can develop a big difference in student education. Students come to school for learning, sometime they get bored from school. But if school make this rule for student the student will be happy with this but in future they will understand that how wrong it is to make a school week shorter without getting anything and just stayed at home. From more school hours and with regular days student can learn something more and keep their grades up.

They will spend their more times with books and paying attention on the study not games or electronic. So the Four-day schhol week will not work for the school it may only work for the buisness but not for the school. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,6.9669928550720215,7

In life there will always be hardships and obsticles that you will have to over come, but if you stay positive through it all not only will you be happy but you will over come thoes obsticals and hardships faster then the average person.

35C5C7E2BB5E,"Working with a group or working alone which one is more beneficial? Well to me working with a group is more beneficial for many reasons. First off you can get help from other members of your group, you don't have to do everything alone you can give each person one thing to do, and you can learn more about the topic. Now that you know my reasons of why i think being in a group is much better and more beneficial then working alone let me go more in depth about it.

Working in a group is great because they can help you with the assignment. If you are struggling and one of your group members sees that you need help then they will help you. They will try and make you understand the problem so you know how to do it. They will give you different strategies and other ways to figure out the answer. For example my math teacher put me and one of my friend in a group for a assignment we were doing and i did not understand the concept. I asked my friend to help me and she sat down with me and showed me how to do it. She gave me multiple ways on how to do it and if it wasn't for her help i would still be lost and not know what to do.

Another reason why working in a group is better then working alone is that each person in your group gets a specific thing to do. If each person gets a specific thing to do in the group then everything will go by much faster. You would not have to worry about doing everything by your self and putting that stress on your body you will have other members in your group that will do their part of the assignment. Last week in history class my teacher put me in a group with 3 other members. We all had a specific thing to do i had to find the citation for the information we got,Chloe found all the information on the topic, Marcus found pictures of the information, and Sean found videos to support the information that we had. We finished the project at then end of class and we also got a A as our grade.

Finally you can learn more about the topic with your other group members. They could find information on your topic that you once did not know before. It can give each student new ideas and information to make the topic more clear for them and also find new discoveries. It will also help them for test and even a quiz because they just did group work and also answered questions and learned new things as well. This is my final reason on why working in a group is much better then working alone.

You can learn more about the topic, you dont have to do all the work by your self, and also your other group members will be helping you if you do not understand the topic and need a little more help. These are my reasons of why i think this is much better then working alone all the time. Having a group will give you more advantages then just being by your self trying to do all the work. It is much more beneficial and i also gave valid reason of why i think being in a group is much better then working alone.     ",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8.0,7.712998390197754,8

Life is great if you keep a positive attitude for example give people advice on somethig good maybe one day they will do the same for you be greatfull with what you have or get beacsue soem people dont have what you have and they really want . Thats why i always have a postive attitude beacuse when i make good discissions i get what i want.

Here are some examples of why you shoud agree for example you get a job a costumer comes by needs help you give them a positive attitude they will give you a positive attitude to help eachother out give them respect talk to them nicely you never know something good could happen second of all what could happen if you give them a bad attitude they will give you the same attitude to. Look at the bright side what happens when you them a positive attitude and they give you a bad attitude you keep the same attitude no matter what they will see and think to their head wow he or she has a nice attitude while the perrson is giving them and ungreatfull attitude.

Always be the bigger person with great attitude even if the person is having a bad day probably try to give them a positive attitude and probably you might cheer them up its always good to make people feel good about themselves afterwards you will feel good because you helped them out .

Community park provide a lot of opportunities such as spending time with friends and family, sports and exercising, and doing school assignments. These are my three reasons what you can do respectfully and peaceful at your nearest community park. I hope you find these helpful for you in the future.

Spending time with friends and family at a community park is a good way of making bonds stronger with each other. Parks have a lot of activities to do in a park for example there is a lot of outside games you can play. My opinion on how parks can make your bond stronger is that you can talk to them while you walk, jog and other activities. For example Generic_Name and Generic_Name went to the park to go play checkers. They talk about grades and other subjects for one hour. Their bonds got stronger they hang out every day.

Community parks have a lots space playing. Sports burns calorie's and it is very fun to play sports. You can make new friends with sports might even get ask to play on their team. For example Generic_Name brings her new ball to her community park nearest to her. Generic_Name brings her ball to the court kids dashing as fast they can to her. A crowd of kid show up to her begging if they can play they make teams. Generic_Name makes a lot of friend and plays soccer with them everyday.

Parks are good way to study and do school work because it is peaceful and natural sounds help you get relax.

Imagine nice sunny day no wind hear of birds and grass bending every direction. Studying in a park will help you a lot because you are not going to get interrupted my neighbors and relatives. People from the park might help you and give you way and strategies to get a good grade on a test. For example Generic_Name want to pass his test. his sibling are loud he can't focus. Generic_Name goes to the community park to study for the big test.

In conclusion parks are a good way to do every day activities than staying home being lazy. I hope this helps you with your every day situation.",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,7.0,6.101747035980225,6
AA6F62C80F73,"Yes, I think that have a positive actitude is the key for the success in life, having a good actitude can help you to think about things with more time, if you dont have a good actitude and you are in a bad mood it can have consecuences like, make bad decisions and etc. have a positive actitude can help you also with people or relationships, for Example, in my life I have bad days and good days, in bad days I made bad dicision and in good days also I mage bad decision but not like in a bad day, it depends in the way tht you see the things, if you see the good way of the things, everything is going to be good for you, but if you always see the bad way of the things you just gonna see the bad things.

it can affect the relation between you and your family, friends, in your work, with the people that you just met etc. this actitude can also help you to transfer the actitude to other people, if you are in a good mood, the people in the roon or around you going to feel in the same mood.

many of the jobs values the actitude that you have and the type of personality on you, in that way they can see in what area they can work with you and if you goin to be a good person in the position indicated, have a good actitude in a good reason for be acepted in many places, people, jobs, sport teams, etc. this is inportant in social life, you can talk with people without problems and can understand other people. also you can help a person in their lifes and help to mke a good decision.

everybody sometimes have bad actitude or they dont have the right one, including every person, like famous.

in many times this happen to me in the my life, when I play for my team, I have bad actitude the other people from my team see my actitude and they may have the same, is hard to consentrate when you have this type of mood, or is hard tto comunicate wih the people or friends, or make decisions, is hard to see the problem when the problem is on you, I think that I have a really bad actitude sometimes and I can even think in somethings and this conduct gave me many consecuences with my family and friend.

So if you want to be a success person in life you have to have always agood actitude, a positive actitude, because everybody knows that with a positive actitude you can think better and you can see the problems and try to fix the problems that you have.

This actitude can help the world, our planet making the people think about us and our planet in general for some reason people always have bad mood and it cant change on them, some people start with bad mood and at the end they have a good mood, I think is the people around you that makes you feel the way how you feel sometimes, like I said if you are in place where everybody had a bad mood you are going to feel in the same way, is the same thing with other people, id you are in a bad mood they gonna feel in a bad mood same like you.

Animal are a great influence in your actittude, they can help you in many ways because they always have a good actitude, well at least if you give them the right education they are goint to be a good type of pet, For example you r dogs, they are the mirrow of your actitude beacuse the way that you treat them is the way that they are going to be woth other people.

Other example are the way that you treat you sons (if you have one) everybody knows that if your son doesns have a good actitude is for the way that you treat him, the educaton that you gave to him, and everything.

we can say that the bad actitude is not a good way for think in things, always have a positive actitude may help you to see the problen and fix it.

Also you can ask for help or you can give help, the thing is not to be in the same actitude if you have a bad actitude and try to be a better person everyday.

I think that way is the best for our lifes and always try to be in a good mood so the people can see that you really have a good personality. thats the first thing that people see on you and is not that hard to change it.

in conclution is the best way to be success in you life have a positive actitude and not a negative actitude.

That is my opinion.

69B2E3BDE779,"While completing high school early may alltow students to enter college or the work force early, it reduces the quality of education that students receive and should therefore not be encouraged. Taking courses in the summer could take away time from being with friends and families , It could also distract them from the sport they play if they play for a team outside of school.

Many opportunities are available in high school that are not accessible to students in college or the work force, for example, high school sports generally allow greater percentage of the student body to participate in high school than they do in post - secondary universities. While many sports are available in post secondary education which is college , only a very small number of athlete students qualify to participate , which means you have to be really good at the sport and stand out from the other players.

It's better to prepare students for the future in both college and work force, teaching students valuable skills that will help them in college, help them earn college credits for a much lower cost than college's do. While students who enter the work force may gain one more year of paychecks then students who remain in high school and graduate in 4 years rather than 3, the advantage is quickly negated. Extra classes is a superior education for those students who remain in high school, it allows them to demand to get higher wages and good jobs than those who graduated early. In my opinion, there are more benefits for those who graduate in 4 years than those who graduate 1 year earlier. These are my reasons why students shouldn't grauduate early and should graudate at four years. ",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,3.5,9.0,8.22300910949707,8
37A8D06A04AC,"What do you think about benefits of working with a group or working alone? Every country, every school, every teachers have teaching for students how to working together to playing games on assignment. And games can make for students likely work together to create atmosphere funny, if they working with a atmosphere new, they could be give some ideas faster and learning better. Why we need to teaching them the way like that? If we did not teaching the students working with a group, what happen will be?

Almost the students really like working alone than working with a group. Because they think they can give some idea bad, and they don't want somebody complain when they do something wrong. If parents or teachers don't teaching them working with a group and believe by them self, they will never successful on the way they are. When Bill Gate was young, him learning about software and computer, when him did not have more idea. Bill Gate told friends about working with him, Bill Gate said: We could be create something new about software and computer. After two years, they could be create the new computer and software. Five years later, Bill Gate become rich people in the world. If Bill Gate did not told friends working with him, than we never know about software and computer like him created that. Bill Gate said: If the war appears, you did not working together, your country will be lost.

Why we necessary to working with a group? Because working with a group might be make your love each other and understand when you work. When a group understand each other, they would be do some project better and always will be on time. Like a company they never have one people working in there, because one people could not be do some project better a group. Every people working in company, they never working with alone, because they don't know where you fail when you writing essay. That's why we need a group can fix your fail and make you do better in your job. When you working with a group, you can learning some ideas your friends talking and the way they working. Danial Williams Hale said: Everything you learn, everything you practice, it's would be help you some case.

If you like working with a group, you can learning skill about your friends, you will be easy to successful on the goals. Like playing games, they need a team working together, if one people in a team like working alone, they can make your team loser. If you like working with a group, you will be have more friends and second language if your friends from another country. If in the world, we don't working together, maybe the world war three will be occur and the peaceful never got in the world. And we will never know culture of another country.

In general, working a group can make students learning about how to work together and give an ideas best. And can be understand more about the life with people in group, can share problem and working better. If you teaching for your son or daughter working together, when they grow up, they can brainstorm better and faster. However, If they knew how to working with a group, they can create one company and system. They will leader a company grow up and never go down.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,6.0,5.3303399085998535,5

Always remember, you are not going to like all the people that you may meet, and some of them are not going to like you. But it is part of life, that happens to everyone.

Bad people will try to destroy you but that is your decision, if you will listen to that people or you are going to ignore them. Why to be yourself? well because your life is your life and you have to be happy in the way that you are.

To be yourself you have to make decisions, and that decisions are yours, not your friend decisions, yours. So don't let someone to make decisions for you. Those decisions are for good, you don't want bad decisions in your life, your friends can help you if you make bad decisions but they can't choose decisions for you.

AB16956A4C54,"Should they add an extra hour and a half? I say they should not because it brings more stress to the kids more information goes in their head , and then they get stuck on to what they are supposed to learn. Many kids already have stress because of how much information is getting put in their head.

If they put more hours to be at school they would have less free time and less time to do their work at home that their teacher has assign to the students. Kids play right after school ends which lets them release their stress and get calm from what they learned . Right after they finish playing they do their work , but if you add more hours students arent allowed to release their stress and frustrate more because of how much homework they get and how much things they need to learn before any test. Students usually dont do their homework because they want to play games or run around and usually they do it at night thats bad but they just want to have fun so it wont mess with their minds if they do work after work and no break.

Teachers may need to know that if their are more hours into school they have less time to get other things done just like the kids. Teachers dont really get things done maybe because how long they stay for school or maybe because how much information they put out and then forget what they need to do right after school is over. Also the kids and the teachers need to be able to hang out with friends and families because if they dont people are gonna think they dont want to hang out with that one person thats why if you add hours it will go wrong kids wont want to play and teacher wont want to go out and be with their kids after work.

High school and middle school have time to do their work because they come out early and wake up early they also have time to have fun hang out do other things they want and get their things done but if they add more school time they have to do work for hours and maybe stay up while they are supposed to be asleep. The students have to study because of how much the test will be graded for if they fail you gotta redo it again or maybe you just get an F. If you dont add time the students have more time to do their work or study from what they need to do and the rest have extra time till its bed time.

Kids from elementary have time to do work if they wake up early but the problem is that if they get out at three and add time the kids will be tired and have stress and wont have enough energy to do things because more work is going to be sent home and they wont be happy so they will get a bad grade for not finishing their work and also have a bad report because they didnt finish school work on time.

I say schools should not be extended because the kids get stressed out and have many more things in their head so I say they should not get more school time so kids and teachers can spend time with families and complete what they want to do instead of stressing. Also the students from each grade most likely wont have a good time because the school time is extended and wont have time to play games . Lat but not least because kids and adults will fade their family time away.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,7.0,6.951133728027344,7

For and example friends like to have sleep overs or girls like to do makeup with each other or boys like to play video games all the time.

42BF43BF8DBE,"Why does the curfews are important in some cities and state for teenagers? The importance's of having curfews in the cities is that they will be out of trouble. Sometimes teenagers not follow the law especially on weekend. Having the curfew in the city will be more helpful for their life. Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will always follow the law, and teenagers will never put them salve in a trouble that may hurt them some way.

Firstly, Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will always follow the law. For instance, Generic_Name lives in Generic_City Virginia and he said that the law here is after 10 p. m. teenagers should not be on streets or anywhere else. He always follow the law and keep him self out of trouble. If the city adopted the curfew after that the teenagers will start breaking the law after these hours. Therefore, every state and city should require curfew for teenagers.

Secondly, Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will never put them salve in a trouble that may hurt them some way. For example, My two friends went outside to have some fun and it was weekend. Saturday night there were out to get some ice-cream for them salve and family. The police stop them in their half way and asked them about what are they doing at this time outside;however, he said that you guys know that the curfew is after 10 p. m. teenagers should not be outside. They lied to police that we were in hospital with our mom, and in our way we bought some ice-cream also. Thus, teenagers never put them salve in a trouble so having curfew is much better then not having it.

Some people argue that, having curfew in a city or state is wrong because they think its interfering in young people's lives. This point is true that curfew keeps teenagers from getting in a trouble. However, curfew can safe teenagers lives because in this age they don't know wrong and right they do what they like, and what they are interested. Curfew unfairly interfere in young people's lives because some teenagers have their own rules, and they don't listen to anyone. Lastly, cities should have curfew to safe teenagers lives and do not adopted the curfew.

In conclusion, the importance's of curfew is to have a better and safe life in your city. Teenagers have the ability to follow the law and get safe of trouble. Some teenagers does not put their self in trouble even if they lie they never get in trouble. Some people says that curfew is a force on young people's lives. Therefore, teenagers should be responsible, follow the law, and keep yourself out of trouble.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,7.0,7.000533103942871,7

I think is not a good idea because, students wants to be in sports and activities , and all most of the students don't have a grade B .

I think it would be better if they have a grade C , because , in that way the students can be in sports, activities and they can study too.

I also think people can have sports so they can work out, and having a C its good , because I think C is a good grade. Some moms wants a higher grade, but sometimes the sports distract us from studying. But i think if we really care about the sports we will be better on studying because its important to us. And if we are good at studying we can enjoy sports.

The grade B , its to high and also a C its good for enjoy sports. And in some classes we are going to have a better grade then C, but in other classes that maybe we are not good at, we don't get it or understand , or just because we don't like it , we are going to have a D but if we really care about sports , i think we can do better then a D , we can try our best and get a least a C .

FAC0A72D62EE,"Churchill's statement is important to American lives. Currently, people who fail always gets back up to keep on reaching for the goal they want to achieve. However, when people fail, they think they should give up and stop trying. It's important to discuss about these different sides. Churchill's statement is important for not giving up or quitting.

The first reason why we should never give up is that we learn from our mistakes. when you fail at something you have to understand that it's not the end of the world. If you don't get something right or you mess up on it, you'll know to get it right next time. It's always important to recognize that you can reach for you're goals to be successful. when you fight for what you believe in, you'll never go wrong.

The second reason why you should never give up is because you want to reach you're top goals. When you want something, you have to fight for it. People who fail or didn't do something right, they give up and say that they have wasted their time, But in life, we can't always win or do something right. we are bound to fail at some point in our lives and it doesn't feel good. However, we keep on pushing for it because we want to be successful and feel great about ourselves to know that we didn't give up.

On the other side, when people give up, they have fail. People who think they have what it takes to be able to get a job, being able to go to a good school, or pursuit their dreams without mistakes, is someone who's going to give up the moment they've fail. The people who got great jobs or got into a good school, worked hard for it. Even when things went bad, they didn't give up because they work hard for that purpose. Some people who fail, often say that they're not smart or not that good. If your not that smart, how are you here today? When you struggle on something, you have to understand that the people around you are the people that can help you with deal with you're problems. Friends and families are the people who can help you in your time of need.

Finally, whenever you have a goal or something you want to have, it's important to never give up or quit halfway through. A goal is something you want to have and by working hard, you know you'll able to reach it in no time. Whenever you get stuck or something goes wrong, you always have support from the people you know very well to help you. By not giving up on what you're trying to reach, you can be able to feel confident about yourself and be able to be confident through life.

7B0430EDACBA,"I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life. I believe is important to have a positive attitude because having a positive attitude can open doors to different phase in life. For example, when it comes to school, significant others and obstacles that life may throw at us. Is important to not loose our cool and have the type of attitude that everything is going to turn out great at the end of the day.

Having a positive attitude when it come to school can be a way to cope with all your assignments, teachers and schoolmates. Especially being a teenager people thing is not difficult to wake up every morning 6 or 7 AM and deal with people's attitude and also having to worry about the amount of work the teachers give out to students and then going home to do chorus is something that teenager are capable of doing, but adults don't take that time to think that they was teens back in the 60s where life isn't easy but when it comes to school rules have change. Now we must pass SOLs to graduate but, a person who stays positive believes in there self makes it easy for their self to get through what's stop you from being happy.

Everyone in life have to deal with different types of obstacles physically and mentally. For example when i came to America I thought my life was over learning a whole different language and also trying to adapt to whole new country a whole different environment would be hard for me. Instead of being hard head i stayed positive learn English really fast and started to start feeling more comfortable in America. I also was thinking of families back home and how i cant let them down, because they would love an opportunity like this to have a free education and being able to make it to the 12 grade. We all go through so much and the only way to get through is having a positive attitude that things well turn out better than yesterday.

Others would say that you dont have to have a positive attitude in life to be successful because they probably dont have self confidence, someone around to give them hope or have giving up on their self to many times. I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life because you viewing life on a whole other level all you see is good things coming your way and the nothing can get in between of your dreams and if you was to fall you going to pick yourself right back up and start again.

In conclusion being able to wake up every morning and thank God for another day and pray that things are going to turn out better than yesterday is an important skill to have in this world we call life. We all have them phase that we go through and we feel like we cant keep moving forward but why stand in the same place with that same negative attitude is going to prevent you from wanting or doing more.

4EB117877F23,"I feel that we should work in groups because its more beneficial and others might have a better idea then you about something. Working alone might be boring for some people and if that person does know that they are doing the groupe could hekp them.

The first reason why I think wokring in groups is more beneficial is because more than on brain think better. More then one person can help on what they are working on. They can help each other on what they need help on. Four people in a group can get things down faster then only one person. People in groups have less to do then one person because in a group everyone does something and being by yourself mean you have to do everything on your own. You also get more tired if your wokring alone and in a group your talking to one other and discusing what you are going to do.

Another reason why I think wokring in gourps is more beneficial is becuase you can learn something new from another person and if your working alone you only have what you know. In a group you come up with more ideas and support them if you think they are right or wrong. If you work alone you get stressed out and if you work in a group you know what you have to do and thata the rest of your group is doing, but if they need help you can help them out on what they need.

My thrid reasaon why I think working in a group is better is becuase you can support other people ideas and oppinions on what they think is better on the work. They can have a better idea then you do and might work better on the job. If you wokr alone you only have your ideas that you think are good but if you work in a group someone could have a better idea or oppinion.

I feel that we should work in groups because its more beneficial and others might have a better idea then you about something. Working alone might be boring for some people and if that person does know that they are doing the groupe could hekp them. People in groups have less to do then one person because in a group everyone does something and being by yourself mean you have to do everything on your own.

314E6ED40C6A,"I remember one time when I applied for one school that was private. I talked with the principal of that school, and he told me that. I needed a specific career for to be in his school.

Students need a specific career by the time they enter to high school.

I'm agree with this article because you already know what do you wnat to do and study to be a proffesional in a future just choose a career that you like it, and then do it.

choose a career that you feel that you like it, and practice all the time for example; I like the mechanic career. I like the cars, and I feel that mechanic would be a good career, because you fix the cars, and I think I can get good money for it.

when you feel that something you like it, you want to do all the time, if you have a career that you like it, practice you career for example; I love play soccer and, play soccer is one of my favorite things I like to do in the summer I practice a lot soccer , one of my dream is to be a proffesional soccer player one day because I love soccer choose one career of proffesional always keep in your mind, and try to do the best to get your career. Each student have a career that they like, but sometimes they don't get the career that they want for reason of the life, but do you best to get finished you career one day for example; my sister she wanted to be a nurse, and she always practice the things that one nurse do, and she always studied a lot for be a nurse, and now she have six year working of nurse. She get career that she wanted, and she told me that when she was little she wanted to be a nurse, and now she is a nurse.

BEFA85A6134B,"Have you ever come across of asking people for an advice if so great. Asking people for an advice is a good way to see what is good and bad. Why cause if you do something stupid your going to regret it. The good part is that it's gonna be for something that your gonna get better at. If so lets say your having a hard time baking a cake and you ask for someones help. The person you ask for help might say "" Don't bake that cake for to long and use less eggs"". So in that case you learn from the mistake and now you know how to bake a cake.

First of all it's great for asking an advice cause you can ether learn from it. When something wrong your friends are there to tell you what to do or what no to do. Cause if you dont ask people for there option it can mess you up. Let's say your about to fight someone without no one concern. If you would of ask for an advice they would of told you ""Dont fight fighting is not the way to go just stay with me you'll be fine"".

Asking for an advice is the way to go less getting in trouble.

Secondly advises can take you far in life you might say how it's just words, but each words have meaning. You remembering what people tell you in situation. Remembering the words they told you and you wont be in that same situation cause you learn from your last mistake. The word that can take you far in like is ""Tell me who you your hanging around with, i'll tell you who yo really are"". That sentence is strong cause it keeps you thing what your doing with your friends and what have you been do. Just ask for an advice to no get in trouble and be a great person in the world.

Lastly advises are great way to show that you care about someone cause not everyone is there for each other. Other might not care your going threw tough time, but ask people for an advice to not to anything stupid or something your gonna regret in the future. Another thing try to asking other people for an advice cause two is better then one. Remember don't do something stupid there are people around you that want to help you in your goods and bad. Lastly be smart of what your gonna do its not gonna hurt you if you talk to someone and get an advice from an old person.

In conclusion, asking people for an advice is great cause it can help you in situation. Such as good and bad there are always time your gonna need to talk to someone. Always ask for help never stay quite cause cause your gonna do something your gonna regret.

F1A5FE43ADD0,"Even though other believe working alone is easier and better. I

strongly believe student do benefit from working in a group. Working in a group has it's advantages, and I feel it's a better choice. When work work in a group you can see different ideas,learn to work with other and also you can met new people.

When you work with other people you can see the different ideas also you can learn know things. You can see the same problem in different ways but as a group you try to find the best way to solve them. For example let's say you have to do a project for a class, and you have to do it in a group. As a group you can share you Knowledge of what you know about the topic and share them with you group . Also you can share you ideas with your group,and see if they like it or maybe they can add something more to your idea to make it a better one . You can see who you have in common with them also you can see the differences you have with you group members .

Working as a group can really have a good advantages. If it is a really big project you dint have to do it alone. Also you can split work and everyone can get a small portion of the project. You can also see people creativity. In a group every one is good in something, so lets say if there is some who is really good at drawing and some one really good in writing then the project can look really nice and the penmanship will look great. You can get it done half as fast with every one in the group does what they have to do and work as a team .

When you work in a group you can met new people. Maybe you change schools. You do not know any one at your new school. When you work in a group, you can meet new people and make friends. It also work if you are shy because in a group you have to communicate with others to get the work done, or you are just a born leader you can help other how to start the project together or tell people how to do thing because they do not know what to do first. Also it works so you can get out your confer zone and try new things. For example you really like to draw but you do not know how to draw really good maybe some one from your group knows how and they can teach you .

As a conclusion I think student do benefit when they are in group. Because not only they can share there different ideas. You learn how to work as a team. You can met new people, and make new friends.        ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,6.0,6.637059688568115,7
02B36EBD5C66,"Students can benefit from this option, but also can affect them in different ways. Many students have difficulty coming to school every single day. One impediment may be transportation, a lot of them do not know how to drive, so they can not drive to school. Some students live in areas where the buses can't enter. Many of them walk to get to school every day or ride a bicycle. They face many problems but the biggest one is weather. The climate can change quickly, when is raining a lot or is cold these students stay at home, because there is no way how they can get to school.

Students can benefit by not attending everyday to school. For students who live far away from school is a great option, because they safe time and also they can work during the day. As we see many students have a job after school, and this is hard for them because they have to be active in school. There is a big problem because they come tired to school, and you see them sleeping in classes. They can not be concentrate because they do not have time to sleep. Many of them do not have time to do homework, or different projects they have to complete.

It is a great option to have schools that offers distance learning. This action help many students but also can affect them. In my opinion when you attended to school everyday you can learn more. Because you have all the resources you need to understand, and complete the assignments. But students who like to work hard and take their time to studying in their houses, it can also be easy for them.

Before that there was not technology is was extremely hard. Now that the science had grown up, and the technology appear, we have a way more opportunity to do many things. One opportunity is to studying online from our houses. As I said now that we have technology, we have more opportunities and is really easy to find stuff that you need to learn in your school.

In my conclusion, I think is good for our society having those school who offers distance learning. Because many students can not be in school everyday, and this action help them to keep studying. If this program does not exist many of them could never go again to school, because of all the impediments they have to attend school, and they will never accomplish their dreams.

At school teachers' tell students' to do a draw about what they are dreaming to be in their future and every students' at young age are have in mind what they will be in the future. It is a good idea fo students to commit to career at young age.

Students need time to prepare for they career in way to succeed in what they want to be in their future.

For example, all career take time to learn about each subjec and students might don't have enough credits to past some classes and they have to take the class again. In addition some students wants to be doctors' and the career for doctors' take a long time and a lot of money that they need to have in way to be get that career.

Such of people says that student just like to be what his or her mother, father, uncle, cousing or some persone that they might almire career is, they might even now enything of thoses career that they want to be becuse they don't have much of knowledge about the job. Even though they says that students don't have in mind how really career that them want is not that easy that how they think it's; they says that students are not responsible enough to decide for ther future career at young age. People think students are not old enough to be ready to take a position in their live.

Deciding for what you want at a long time help students to do things better beacuse you have more time to fix you mistakes in your career.

4D23A7FA9408,"Although some say students wouldn't benefit attending classes from home because students will not have the opportunity to work in groups with other students, actually students would benefit attending classes from home because they will feel comfortable and students can be more safe.

Those who believed not being able to attend classes fom home wouldn't benefit students because they can't work with other students. Around 200 articles said that students that attend online classes don't have the best projects just because they can't have other student's opinion. For example, so many different ideas by having a group can be more interesting than only having a person's ideas.

However, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can feel comfortable. Furthermore, a school survey showed that students prefer online clases because that makes them feel comfortable just to be seated inappropriate. I agree with these people because I like to be seated in many ways, but in school rules is only a way to be seated.

Also, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can be more safe. Lately, more than hundred school shootings had happened, so it show us being at school can be dangerous. Other big danger can be gangs at school they can be an influence with so many bad things on a child's life.

In my opinion being able to attend classes at home can make parents happy; they don't have to be worried for their child's safety.

As you can see students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students can't stay connect with other students, actually being able to attend classes from home would make students feel comfortable and secure. ",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,5.0,6.227928638458252,6
85E806A814BA,"""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. While I disagree with Emerson statement. Many people around you think it's there job of choosing what makes your future, but there wrong. Don't let someone push you on doing something you don't want to be. If you want to be someone important, then be that important person. Never stop walking on the pat that's leading you to the future you want.

Let everybody see who you are. Dont hide away because your shy or because your scared that they will judge you by who you are. Let's dream together, stand up for what you want to be. Let's do something that the whole world will see. It doesn't matter if your goal wasn't as big as the person beside you, at least you know that you reach the goal you stared with. You will be happy that you've matter too. All the accomplishment that the world wants to make you do, just turn it around make it to your goals. Make it to what you can do. Suprise everyone to the REAL you! Their is always great accomplishments around you just make one yours!

Many People thing its hard to go through so much work just to meet your goal, but later you'll see that all that hard work you work for was worth the time. You now know you don't need someone to pick your future, because your proving them that you can do it. That you have other choose make ahead. To ever look down, and always look up.

Me have to be someone else to make the world happy, just by make the people think I like what there doing? No I won't like to do that. Doing what I really want will not just make the world happy but also make me really happy of myself. To not let others effect me too. Not everybody good at everything. We all have different skills and talent in us. We have many amazing things in us, just for someone to tell us that we can't do it.

7065B172D758,"When you have a problem do you think to yourself, how can I do my best to fix this problem? American jazz legend Duke Ellington said,""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" In my opinion, I agree with Duke Ellington's quote. One reason, is if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. Another reason, is if you try do your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. Lastly, if you don't put any effort try to resolve a problem you could end up back in that hole.

I agree with this quote because if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. One reason, is the amount effort you put in to a problem could affect your future. Also, a chance to do your best to fix a problem could be a one time opportunity. One example, of this is about my cousin he could have been playing professional soccer but he didn't try his best on the tryout which made him not make the team. Lastly, if you don't do your best in a situation it could affect your life.

I also agree with this quote because if you try your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. First, if you try your best in a situation you can learn on what to improve on. One example, is about my brother he did his best on a test and got a 82 percent now he knows he has to improve in that subject. Another example, is when one of my friend's brother did his best in a race and lost which made him train more and harder to improve his speed. Overall, If you don't do your best you will not learn and improve from a situation.

Another reason, I agree with this statement is because if you don't try your best in a situation then you will end up back in the same hole. First, if you don't try to solve a problem then it will come back in to your life and you will have to deal with it again. First example, is about my younger brother who didn't try on a test and got a bad grade which made him retake the test. Also, if you try to solve a problem then you will learn from your mistakes and wouldn't commit the same mistake twice. Finally, it is important to do your best in a situation because it would make you improve yourself from your mistakes.

In conclusion, I agree with this quote because you should always try to do your best in a problem. First, you wouldn't regret at least trying to solve a problem. Then, you could learn ways to improve on, to help you solve the problem. Also, if you try your best in a problem then, when you have the same problem you will know how to solve it. Finally, if there is a problem it's also chance for you to show others what you can do.      ",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,5.0,9.0,7.386472225189209,7
