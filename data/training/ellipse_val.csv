A1EC959B8C13,"Would it be surprising to know if students to know that students learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by the students getting to much school work that cannot be handed in one night. Students complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing any students to work on their own schedule help them become more motivated to work on their assignments. Students being educated at home gain more time to study and make up their own rules but responsible with it. Learning at home and not at school helps students to benefit themselves to get better grades.

One of the advantage of homeschooling is it can be done anywhere and at anytime. Because it can be done by a touch of a good night sleep, students rise up in morning fresh and have a flexible time schedule. The students can work around their parents schedule instead of the parent working around the student's schedule when it is time do some distance learning. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. The students cannot always work at the pace set by teachers. Distance learning allows students to work on their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress. Because instead of worrying about the rules the students can focus on their studies. Distance learning can improve certain students learning process by having a more available schedule and by letting them learn in their own way.

When taking a test or notes at school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home benefits students. Learning from home doesn't have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing resulting in better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in a class where other just fooling around which makes others who want to stay focus feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. In school, you are stuck at a desk listening to the teacher's teachings for six hours and have a limited time to eat and take bathroom breaks. But there is other way around, if you are home, you can eat and do what you want when you want. Because of this, students will feel less pressured and get better grades then they would have if they were in school.

There are still a few reasons not to do distance learning. There many more opportunities with public and private schools. People from different colleges don't go to student's homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public and Private schools are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school, funding for public schooling will fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of budget cuts. In public schools and private schools, depending on the teacher, cheating is hard to do. On the other hand, schooling at home, the students can easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device. So for all that matter it was you choose from not what want, it what you need.

Students should be offered classes online or at home because it is less distracting and less stressful. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. With a more flexible schedule, students would be more likely to succeed and make good grades. Even though socialization in the school environment allows students to make friends. The conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could affect the student in adulthood. Many students all over the world successfully take some, and even all classes from home. In the near future, school systems and all districts should provide distance learning.",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,9.0
11402548A471,"Does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement?

True self-esteem comes from praise because it can be motivating to students,it helps them want to learn more, and it helps the student to achieve any goal even if the work is not the students effort.

one reason why motivation can help a student build self-esteem is because when you feel that you're not able to do something, but if you have someone who's there with you, you are motivated to keep on going, to keep trying harder until you achieve the goal that you want.

For example, the first time that I took the W!SE test I didn't pass the firs time and I was close to pass, but I had my mom who told ""don't worry you're smart and I know that you will pass the second time"" and those words motivated me and it helped me to studied more and then when I took the test the second time I passed. Therefore, motivation can help students to build self-esteem and to achieve any goal.

Another reason why praising students can help build self-esteem on them is that they may want to learn more if they got someone who's always supporting then and help them to keep trying, for example, when I was in elementary school I used to get really bad grades, but I've always had my mom who has always supported me in anything and she told me that I could get better grades because I was smart to achieve any goal and it helped me to keep learning and I was motivated to get better grades, in middle school I started to get good grades and now in high school I've got better grades than I used to get in middle school, therefore, praising students helps to build self-esteem on them and it help them to want to keep learning more.

In addition, praising students can help them to achieve any goal even if the work is not the students best effort, it helps them to keep trying harder even if things don't go well and it helps them to never give up.

For example, English is not my first language and It was hard for me when I came to America because I couldn't understand anything, I couldn't communicate with other people who didn't spoke the same language as me. When I first came to America I didn't like to speak English because it was hard for me to pronounce each word, but I had to learn English to communicate with other people.

I used to cry because I couldn't understand anything, I couldn't even say a word in English, but I had people who always told me not to worry because I was smart and that I was going to learn English that really helped me to build self-esteem on me, I don't speak English perfectly, but now I'm able to understand and to communicate with other people.

Therefore, it is important that we got people who are there to support us and to motivate us to keep trying hard no matter how hard it is or how hard it looks.

Praising students builds self-esteem on them, because that gives them motivation to keep trying hard to achieve any goal, it motivates them to keep on going and to learn more each day, with people who motivates students, it does not matter how hard things are, they just want someone who is there to support them in anything. There are some students who don't like giving up, but sometimes if there is nobody who helps them to keep going they will stop trying, because they need motivation, they need someone who is there whenever they need them.

My mom had always supported me and I know that she always be there for me, she will always motivate me, that builds self-esteem on me because I know that I have someone who will always support me and that helps me to keep trying harder and to never give up. If we got people who praise students, then they're going to build self-esteem on them.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,8.0
8D6424E93B3A,"I think Technology had positive and negative effects because,

Positive effects like Technology allows people to complete many tasks just using your phone or computer,with technology you can see what is happening around the world,with technology you can talk with your Friends,Family. Technology allows you to met new peoples,to know things that we don't know.

Negative effects about using technology, technology change alot peoples lifes. people don't go outside because they using his phone,example people using his phone and driving,people walking using his phone and not looking around that can cause a accident,

in my position it be 50/50 because without technology i be boring because i dont know whats happening in the world, in my country i can't even talk with my family,with technology i can play video game i can have fun watching tv or movies but is a negative effects

D6C9DE61BAF4,"There are three examples about if I agree or desagree about the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life"". I agree with this statement about the importance of attitude and I will give some reasons.

Firts example, one reason that why I agree with this statement is because,if you want to apply for a job, you need to have a positive attitude to be sucessful for other people because they want to see the best of you and if you can have that job and how you relate with other people and you will see the results about it . Many people with bad attitude are lay off of their work because at work you have to show your best attitude with the costumers,boss or with other workers but some people don't do it . If you are the boss, you needs to have a positive attitude or try to have it because your workers hope the best attitude of you to manage the job and that can show respect of your person.

Second example, another reason that why I agree with this statement is because all people desserve positive attitude like, if you are walking at the park and you say ""hi"" or ""have a good day"" to other person with a positive actitude they will feel good and they would think that you are a good person . Be a person with a positive attitude can be successful for yourself or for your family for example, if one of the family members has a bad day and they see you, his mood can change because of your positive attitude, you make him feel better with advices about how he needs many options to resolve his life but if you have a bad attitude you make him feel irate of you.

Third example, the last reason that why I agree with this statement is because, if you are in the school there are many teenager like you that have hard classes, but some of them have a positive attitude because they want to have a good grades, pay attention in class and try to help other students who needs it, they try to make them sucessful too, so they can have a good grades or a good future . But, if they have a bad attitude they would be have bad grades,they don't pay attention in class,they try to distract the students who want to pay attention,make argument about the class or sometimes they scape the class because they feel that they have a bad attitude and that's why it has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life.

In conclusion,in this three examples I give reasons that why I agree or desagree with the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life"". If you have a positive attitude that can make you a better person or successful for yourself and other people.",2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,5.0
55EE5B4FC54F,"Have your parents or relatives ever told you about something that happened to them? Well, my dad often tells me about his experiences. At first, I did not care much and got bored whenever he would tell me a story about something that happened to him. However, I now realize that learning from his experiences is necessary. Learning from the experience of others is important because you learn from their mistakes, you know how to react to situations, and you can learn more about that person and what they have gont through.

I have done several things that I regret. I often find myself doing something, and then wondering why I chose to do that. By knowing what others have experienced, you can learn from their mistakes. You can learn about the mistakes that they have made in the past, and know that you should try to avoid doing the same thing as them. You know what they did wrong, so if you ever find yourself in the same situation as them, you do not end up doing something that you will regret later. Listening to other people's experiences also teaches you how to react to situations

My dad has told me about the numerous people he has helped. By helping those people, he has not only made them happier, but he also feels good about himself. Because of that, I know that I should try my best to help other people who need it. Knowing how to react to unexpected situations is something you can learn from listening to other people's experiences. For example, if I see someone who dropped something, then I will pick it up for them, because my dad has taught me to try to help others. Learning from other people's experience will help you and make you a better person overall. Additionally, you can learn more about what they have been through.

By learning about other people's experiences, you can know what they have gone through. Personally, I learned a lot of things about my dad that I didn't know before. For example, my dad once went all the way from Generic_City to Generic_City to go pick up his friend's daughter. She was unable to drive because her car had broken down. He was not obligated to help, but he did because he likes to help people. That was something that I never knew about my dad. You can learn things that you never knew about someone, along with the problems they have faced throughout their life.

In conclusion, learning from other people's experience is important because you learn from their mistakes, you know how to react to situations, and you learn more about what that person has bee through. I have learned a lot from my dad. Because of him, I know what to do and how I should act. I am grateful because learning from my dad's experiences has made me a better person.",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,8.0
EA37D9C12C91,"life is to much fun and joy and happines we just need to know how to organize it to make it easer, so we can be better as we can.

4F158CCF45AC,"First, i would say i agree with most of the student that they are intersting to finish their high school in three years,and in my opinion that is good for them so, they can have more years for college and some of the students have to do that to graduate early for example, i am one of them i have to finish the high school in three years because when i came to united states i came too old and i didn't take the freshman year in united states that is why i have to graduate in three years.

Most of the students are preparing for good colleges and some of the colleges you have to stay so many years to finish them. and also from my experinse it is hard enough as it as in four years but i know so many students have done it before and they sucssed on it. and i know some student have done it too but in 2.5 years. and i almost have done it and it have been good for me but it need alot of work and you have to study hard and foucces in your school and do your homwork and get good grades and don't do any pronlems in school becasue if you did any thing wrong you are going to stay more years at the school.

it is good to graduate early whenn you are young so you will have alot of years in college to be a heigher education. at the end i would say and support every one that want to graduate early because it is good for their future and i have to say thank you for the people that they are helping me to do that.

AB75D2DC92B7,"Schools were made for people who wants to learn and be a successful person in life even though , there are some people who don't have the opportunity to be in school. Right now in some countries be on school until you are 18 is a law but it other countries government those not care about children future. Here in the United States they have the option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. They have that option specially on universities because some universities are out of the city and a percentage of students with a bad economy may not be viable to get transportation everyday. So In my opinion that is a great idea to have that option on universities. They should have the same option in high school but not to all the students because that may cause students to fail the classes. High school 's should give that option to students with excellent notes and for students who live out of town. Attend classes from home by online or videos has benefits, oneis you become more responsible,

second it helps you to earned money, and gives you more opportunities to success.

In one hand,Attend classes from home it may be a big responsibility because you are doing it by your own no one is going to help you or push you to learn. For example when you attend to class in a school or colleague there is always a teacher ,who is there to help you,supports you ,and make sure you don't fail your semester, they also make sure that you are learning and getting better everyday. Instead when you have to attend classes by yourself you must be confident and responsible to make sure that you are going to take classes everyday and don't waste the opportunity,because no one is going to be telling you more than 3threet times to do you work .There are some students that don't know what be a responsible person means, does students may not be viable to get good greats by taking classes from home. This kind of students need help from someone to push them and teach them to be a responsible person. Be a responsible person is important because it helps you to success in life gives more opportunities and you don't depend from nobody you learn how to do things by your own.

In the other hand one more benefit to attend classes by home in online it helps you to earn money specially if you live in large distance from school. A few houses are located miles away from the city that means schools are located miles a way from home. In that case attend classes from school it would be very helpful and a big opportunity. Because take transportation everyday Monday to Friday it may be expense because you may pay at mornings to get to school and pay back in the afternoon to go back home. One more benefit is that it help you to success,you may be a viable to find a job. For example you can do your online classes in the mornings and find a part-time in the afternoon. Many students do this they go to school on mornings and work for a couples of hours at night. But if you could attend classes from home it would be so much easier to work and study at the same time you would made your own schedule withou a problem. Also make sure to give enough of time to do your online classes and get good greats.

In conclusion

I do believe this potion to attend classes from home in online or videos is a great opportunity. Specially for students who live out of the city and for everyone who was to success in life no matter what. School and universities should let students know about this option. I am agree and I believe that I may not be the only one who support this idea. Therefore this opportunity should give to students who really needs it and no to those who would waste it .This kind of option should be in all over the world to help people with bad economy and help those who want to success and have a passion to learn. Students who have the opportunity to attend school everyday without a problem should know that there is people that live far from the city that they would love to be seated in a classroom and attend school everyday.

7E29ACA46157,"Summer vacation is a good break for the students to spend time with their family, also a good way to take a break form school and your annoying classes, to take some rest, change your mind, and think about what will you change, when you go back to school, also taking a long summer vacation will get yourself out of stress. you will be able to do other think than just memorizing stuff you don't need in a real life, that's why it's not a good idea to reduce students summer break just because educators say so, we need to have some fun and start learning new stuff about the path we want to take in our life.

First of all taking a long summer break will restore ourselves, it will change our personally there might be people that are devastated from getting bullied at school, some people that have stress and don't want to talk about it and need some time to think about it, some that fail the SOL,and are failing a class, and never want to repeated again, or get ready for summer school, some that need to get ready for the next school year. we need time to do all those stuff and make our life better, when we come back from summer vacation. Summer vacation also give us the opportunity to get a job and save money, two months is pretty enough to get you at least much money. Some students that take care of themselves need to have more time to get ready for the next school season, so they can buy what they need such as: school supplies,clothes, ETC..... summer vacation need to be long enough so we can spend time with our family. school is not our family but home, the only reasons most students come to school this day are to make new friends.

Second think school is worthless, we dont need to go to school for that long what we need is to work hard to achieve our dream, and have some fun with life, that's all we need, and if we stay in school for a year and spend less time at home, we will not be able to communicate well with our family, this is not a good idea, there are people that went to school, and got their high school diploma, went to college for 2 years, and are still working at McDonald for few money, that means they just waste a lot of time at school this whole year and didn't get any good from it, so if we stay at school for a year, we will then spent 12 year getting educated, and still not achieve our dream, still going to have a job at a fast food restaurant. we need a longer break so we can recover form school stress and spend time with our family, school now last for 10 month and summer vacation last for 2 months and a half, so we should leave it like that.

Third thing is taking off one week off spring break and fall break is really a bad idea, why because we need to have some rest and some fun. who want that, no one want a week off spring break and also a week off fall break. what, that's insane, we are going to do a year at school and get only a total of 1 months off out of 12 months what, no, that is a bad idea, if we get a year of school , how are we going to get 3 week or 4 week of summer vacation there will be no summer vacation. School start in September and finish in June so, when we will have a year of school we will be finishing in August that make 12 months of school, so where is the summer vacation break.

so some people might disagree with me, but i think that what we should do is change the school system. so lets say some students like school and want to get to the higher level.

i'm sure that they have families and have to rest. for example; let's take a place of a student that want to be a athlete, and is learning math, science, economics, and other stuff for 12 years without getting any lessons from the the types of athlete he want to be, so that's kind of bad and not good, why because getting educated for something you don't have any interest in or you don't like at all, it's not good. we can say math might help you a bit, but not everybody want the same things, also not getting a long break will weaken our brain.

Every country have the same system break as us, not all but at least FRANCE has the same as the U.S, by changing our break time it might affect other countries, students will have more stress and will not have fun at home with their family, parent might also complain about changing the break and going to school for a year, by the way every time we come for a new school season we learn new things and different things, At least half of what we learn just come in some of the topic, we will not have the same class as last school season, but new one and new different topic, you will only have the same stuff to learn, if you fail the class or if you the SOL in that class, and that's why we need a longer break so we can focus more on that in the break time and won't fail no more next school season.

Family over school, family is the most important thing, i'm don't know anyone that dont like his families members, so let's said that we should not reduce the school break, or go to school for one year, we should also change the school system so we can put students in what they are trying to become the future they want to build, the future might need more people that could do a lot of different stuff, we might need help for, then let's agree that going to school for one year is not worth it for some students and reducing the summer vacation is a bad idea.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,6.0
58A9AE90D009,"What I think about extending two more hours in school would be a bad idea because school can be very stressful and give you so much work that can cause people headaches and won't even have time to do their homework at home and they would get really tired and sleepy that looks like their brain will explode with so much work they do and they would have health problems too a person would not resist too much of their body either.

My opinion about it is that they should keep the five-day school week instead of four because I think it's really unnecessary to add more hours to school and take one more day of off. I think if that happens they will take the time from other students time with what they are doing outside of school and activities. The idea would be very pointless and useless. I think five days of school is better than four because five days they have seven hours of school and it's shorter. For me I would get really stressed with more hours of school be more hours means more work to do and I would get really tired of doing so much work and I would get really exhausted. People would have many things in their head and worry too much about it that would cause so many stress and a headache and it would not be good for them.

I think there is some other way to conserve energy and resources than adding hours to school and work. For example they should take care of the earth by recycling and cleaning the water and save up energy. I think it is the best idea to conserve energy and resources because it really important to take care of the earth and learn how to take care of the earth. Many people these days are careless and would prefer to do it in another way like adding more hours to school which is not helpful and that won't do nothing of helping energy and resources, so we have to do another way to conserve it. What I think people should use their brains and do what's best for the whole world and every around us and be helpful. Like for example restore energy would be a good idea or volunteer would be another thing to help the planet, there are so many ways you can do it and how you can do it so it would be really helpful if Everyone would join doing it.

Many people would be disappointed for adding hours because they are subtracting their time and very important things they have to do. A lot of people that over work themselves means their they would get really tired and lazy and the community would be very disappointing and out of control. Another problem would be that if they overwork and get tired and them while driving and could get into to a car accident and that's another why their are so many accidents happening lately and that is really bad so it is a bad idea.

Know one would agree to work more hours and that would cause them to have health problems and their body does not take to much exhaustion in them and that is really dangerous and would risk their life's for it, i would not over work myself if I were them that is too much to Handel and would get me sick too that my body would not take it either so no it would be a really bad idea.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,8.0
D2517350CB3A,"Elective classes are chosen by student who are intresting to be part of it. Many students

Probably prefer to have a elective clase because they are learning what they like, and will be less difficult for them to understand the class. In my positon students should be required to take elective classes because they attend to school every day, students are teach in what they want to learn and students are much success in class.

Many students do not attend to school in order to not have a clase that they do not like. Students that use to not attend school is when he/she have a class that is not intresting to learn; they may think that the class is not important enough to help them in a future, and letting students to take elective classes probably will stop the absence of many kids because they will want to know new things about the class . Furthermore if students have an elective class they will have that exicitement to start the class on time and not be late, neither to miss school any day because of their interest of learning .

Students should be guide in what they may think is useful and much helful for them. In some school people had heard that many students are teach In things that may not be needed in life like art, some students take art because they like that clase and problably because In the future they Might be plaining to become an art teacher, but for others is preferable to select an elective class that will manage her/ him to be succsessful. As a result of take an eletive class can be a tool for students to discover what subject is most important for them to have knowledge and have the passion of keep learning.

However other may say that students should be required to take a music, art , drama class because students can have intertainment having these kind of classes, but I stiil be thinking that students should be required to take an elective class because learning what they like, they put much effort to get knowledge and good grades, for example study, pay attention to what the teacher is saying participating in class or any other activity. Moreover obtain good results of what they decide to choose to become a successful student.

Students who take elective classes have the advantage of learn what is interesting for them , and be succsess no just in class also might be helpful for students in a future. Be able to choose a class is a good opportunity because it helps students to be intresting in new projects, know new things and obtain a good education at school.

People now days don't want to be friends with someone who is always mad and is ready to fight someone, and because of that particular time you had serious face it led to you not having a girlfriend or a friend that was going to be with you for the rest of your life. First impressions can be hard to change and its impossible because once you had that one chance you waste it all due to that one serious face that everyone was intimidated and now people don't want to talk to you because all it would've took was a smile.

Then,not taking care of yourself can make people not wanting to talk to you. Hygine can can change everything and lets people know about who you are and it makes people wanting to talk to you. Having a bad odor can lead to people running away,can make you look like you just don't care about your'self why would you care about others. Hygine is really important if you want to impress because otherwise it would make a bad impressions leading you not having friends or a girlfriend because no one wants to be around a person who smell bad and doesn't take care of themselves. The smilling comes in quick too, because you have a friendly convertion with people around you and people wnat to be your friends and it may not be because you don't smile. Your breath also counts becasue people like to have a conversation without having to smell what you ate for dinner or what you had for lunch, so is important to saty up with all those things beause people take notice of all those small things and the see that is woth talking to you.

Therefore having the proper clothes for the proper time can change the way people look at you and it can make you have friends and be known for dressing good and people now days want friends who dress up good, for example is the homocoming dance and you go with your friends and you're wearing jeans and shirt and you have your friend all dress up for the occasion and theres you now no one wants to take a picture with you or dance with, dressing the proper way can make a difference on how people see you and is somehting that is a proven fact. When my satrted working as a chef people in the streets would see that her clothes would be all dirty with food stains it would make people think that they don't know how to cook and what is funny that she was making lots of money making food for important people and people was thinking of a different way when she was making more money than the people judging her, but when she started working as a nurse people would respect her for the way she was dress, eventhought she was not making the same amout of money, but people people saw her differently. Those all cahnges that you make in your clothes can make a difference and they don't have to be expensive of from a popular brand because all it is clothes is just how you use them and what makes it good that the clothes can be cheap but how you use them for the proper ocassion can make a difference.

In conclusion having a serious face,not taking care of yourself and the way you dress up can make people have diffent thoughts of you. When being approche or even if they don't talk to you they will see that your not worth talking to and after they know who you are and your way of life style can make people hard to change that first impression of you. All this small things can chenge your life because I have been through those situatioins where people look at you differently and it makes it hard to change someones thought of you and that first impression that is important. Having a diffent mentality can change everything and peoples way of thinking.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,8.0
1E122D099A1A,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the additional four years. Honestly it is a good idea that some high school offer a program like that. They got their things done in three years. The students who do that take their time, also spend time during the summer, they dedicated more to get done their studies in a short time. Some people will think that is not fair for the others students, that graduated in four years.

First, if the students wanted to finished high school early. They have ideas; otherwise, they had already thought what they wanted to be. They push themselves to another level, to get their things done, however, some of them do that to start saving money. The year that they wasn't in school, they took it to get ready for college, with the money, with the papers, they have the time to over think what they really want. I will put my cousin of example, she did that, she graduated in three years, then she got two jobs to get money for her college, she push herself to do what she really wants. Now, she's in college getting her degree as nurse.

Second, if all the schools offer that I know that a percent of students will be doing that. A lot of people think if they could have a chance to get graduated quickly as they can. Some of them because they want to help their families soon as possible they can. We have a lot of immigrants, they came to the country to a better life, and I know a lot of them will like to get graduated early. It is a good choice for all of them, they can help their families.

In conclusion, it is a good chance for students, they dedicated time to graduated in three years, they push themselves to be someone with a good degree some day, some of them do that, just because they have families issues and they want to help them getting done high school early. Some of them want to get done early because in one year they have other chance to get some money, to make sure want they really want to be some day. It is a really good offer.

I believe people should make their own decisions. Because everyone is responsible for their actions.

Not everyone have someone who help them with their decisions.

Some people do not like that people tell them what decision they have to take or what they have to do.

In some countries people have the freedom to do whatever they want.

They choose if they want to do the right things.

For example, we can see a lot people in the jail, the majority of them are teens.

because they took bad decisions in their life.

We can see people who do not count with family or friends when they need them. For example, I am a person who do not like have a lot friends.

I have family, but I do not count with all my family when I need it.

Who's always with me sometimes is my brother.

I notice that friend are with us when they need something from us.

In some many times we can see or we can notice a lot people who do not like that people tell them what they have to do.

For example, I have a sister who got married when she was 15 years old.

I remember that my mom always tried to talk with her, if she was sure about her decision, because my mom did not want that she got marry.

Anyways, my sister got married.

When she was 17 years old, she got pregnant and her husband left her and her baby, because she did not wanted to hear my mom.

However, some people should seek guidance from experts and authorities.

People who always get in trouble.

People who can not make their own decisions.

People who have a sickness, like Syndrome of Down or other serious sickness.

In conclusion, I think we are responsible for our own decisions, but we have to listen advises that help us to take a good decision.

We have to remember that every decisions that we take have consequences.",3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,6.0
38E03AE14C78,"Go beyond to grow or don't grow at all. Ralph Waldo Emerson once said unless you try to do something beyond what you mastered you will never grow. Never going out of the shell can make it hard might never know what skills able to get in life. Don't ever try something new can make life boring and might never experience whats life is about. Get way more in life go beyond and try something new make life way more amazing as it supposed to be. Being able to be good at something and mastered it why do you need to go beyond and do something else. Going beyond dose not always promise susses it can lead down to a road of failure. Doing it again trying to go beyond and mastering something else can take a lot of time and energy if not being sure to do it.

Make it easy get out of that shell and go get new skills. When i was in high school i never Thought of doing anything new. I always stick to what i was good at. But that made my life so difficult as i never went beyond what i can do. But someone told me to stop being scared get out of your shell and try something new. As i did what he told me to do and it was the best thing i could of done in my life. As i got to try something new met new people got new skills and most importantly got out of my shell i was stuck in. There was a basketball player named Michael Jordan one the best basketball player to ever to live on this planet. He once told a story that he was to scared to play basketball because he was never good at it and he said won""t make it to the team. But his mom told him how cloud he passably ever know that if he didn't go out and try to make it to the team. Then it hit him to attest try it out and he did and now look at him as hes one of the best basketball player ever.

Tried of that boring life go beyond and make life more amazing as it supposed be about. I was never trying go beyond in my life because i never thought i needed to. But i Finley realize that my life was boring and awful and i thought to my self that it is time for a change and i did the unthinkable and went beyond to do something new in my life. I went and practice soccer and i was bad at it first but practice takes time and i got good at it. I even made to the team. I grew so much as a person wile playing soccer that i can even say it made me a better person. Brock Obama once the president of the untied state of America said if you stick to the same old boring thing you will never grow as a person. How will you know what you are cable of doing if you never go beyond he said. Do something new he said and get what you been waiting for most of your life.

Get way more in life and grow as a person wile doing it. I was the same old boring person for ever because i never went beyond what i can do or what i can get. I thought it was a waste of good time and energy to try and do something new oh boy how wrong i was. I said to myself i need to grow up and go find something else for me or else how would i fine my place in life who will i ever be and what can i do. I later found the answer to what i was searching for my entire life. The key was to go beyond in life and try something new in life and i did that. Was one of the best choice i can ever picked. However it wasn't easy but it was worth it. My best friend all his life he did nothing he never wen't beyond he stick to what was working and never change it. That made him the same old boring person that will never grow out of his shell because was to scared of change. As many people are in life. But i told him it worked for me in life as it did for many as well. At first he was little unsure but i Finley convince him to do it. He moved forward to the big change and try something new but at first he failed as many else people do at there first time. But practice makes better and as he did practice and he got better at it as so many people do in life he Finley was successful and wen't beyond he was so proud of his choice.

Doing something else can cause a big problem and make you regent it because you go down to a road of failure. No how would you know if you don't practice at it failing is just in excuse not to do it. Waste to much time and energy of doing it just stick what your good at. Doing something new is not a waste of time and energy and it can be a good learning experience wile doing it you can also grow to. What if your already good at something there is no need to go beyond. Yes there is if you don't you just be stuck in the void of never growing you can also see what you can get wile doing it.

In conclusion what im trying to say that make in easy for yourself and get out of your shell doing it and get yourself new skills. Don't make life boring as it already is do something new go beyond. Grow as a person wile doing find your new improved self. As many people did they wen't beyond and try something new and it worked for them and they were proud of them self and i grantee you would to.

The people who don't make their own decision can have easy life, and they don't have to think about it; however, it's better to make their own decision by them self. People should make their own decision because they can have self confident, they can be happy in their life, and they can face challenging moments in life.

First, people should make their own decision because they can have self confident. If people have self confident they can learn new things, and they can start doing something by them self. For example, someone can try to make me a decision that I am not interested in, but I shouldn't follow that decision. I should get up and start making my own decisions by my self without any ones help. Another example, my friends can try to decide the classes I have to take, but if I have a self confident I can choose the classes I need. No one can tell me what to do in my life. It's better for people to make their decision by them self, so they can have self confident.

Second, people should make their own decision because they can be happy in their life. If other people makes a decision for me, I won't be happy about that because they don't know what makes me happy or sad. For example, if my family want to choose me something that I am not interested in, or something that is not important to me I should tell them that is not going to make me happy. Another example, some people don't want others to be happy in their life, but they shouldn't let them in to their life. It's better for people to make their decision by them self, so they can be happy in their life.

Third, people should make their own decision because they can face challenging moments in life. It is good to face challenging moments in life because they can make them be strong. For example, if I make a decision that is not important to me, so I can learn how to get out of it. If people make something by their self, and don't like it, they should learn how to pass that challenging time. Another example, in this year I challeng my self by taking difficult classes, but it was bad idea because I got bad grades on first quarter, but I change the class after that bad grade. It's better for people to make their decision by them self, so they can face challenging moments in life.

In conclusion, people should make their own decision because they can have self confident, they can be happy in their life, and they can face challenging moments in life. First, they can have self confident to make something by their self. Second, they can be happy in their life if they are making something by their self that can make them be happy in their life. Third, if they choose wrong decision they can learn how to pass challenging moments. For those reasons it's better for people to make their own decision.        ",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,8.0

If the student is expected to identify a career by highschool it can affect how their doing in school becuse all they will be thinking about is a career to pick.

I can do this by staying after school so i can practice more skills,or ask the teacher or students for help when I need too.

I think practicing your voice skills is very important if you want to enjoy the chorus class because you can get alot out of it. Ones you're out of the basics you can get more advance classes.

Secondly i think learning from others can help you because if you don't know something that other student knows you can ask if they can help you. Also seen what other student might do you can get an example from them or you can do what they are doing for you to get better at it.

Also when it gets to performing in front of alot of people I might get nervous because I'm not use to that I might even forget the lyrics of the song that I'm singing ,but ones you've done alot of performs you are not going to be afraid of going to sing in front of alot of people.

Some students may think that school board should not add more hours to school because its going to be too boring and a waste of time. But in the other hand some student may think that is a great idea because they can have extra time for learning. Well i think that the School Board should not add more hours of school because it will be too boring, teachers will not know what to do with the extra time, and at the end student won't paid attention.

First of all everybody is already used to the school schedule and if the schedule change, It will have a huge effect on everybody. not just students but also teachers and staff . The teachers already have their class plan but if school board change the schedule its going to be a mess. students will start paying less attention . that's one of the main reason why the school schedule should not be changed.

Probably a position like that will be deleted immediately . because parents, students, teachers etc will be disagree. its going to be too boring for students to be in school for one and a half extra hours at school. some students may could even get out of control.

Finally i know for fact that teachers are going to be one of the person who most likely are going to be disagree with adding more time to school because they don't get paid well, they want to go home, and sometimes they don't even want to teach. in addition to that , if school if school board add more time to school the teachers won't know what to do with the extra time that the school board in giving to them.

In my conclusion school board is not going to add one and a half hours to school each day. because most of the people is going to be disagree , nobody wants more time at school , is the worse idea that school board ever had. also i feel like if is going to be a great mistake. and even if school board try it it's something that will never be done.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,7.0
04ACA7EB3994,"No,I dont think students should attend online classes from home. Because online classes might be sometimes harder for them to understand and to get help. It is always better to take classes in the person so students can learn better and get more experience and they can easily get help from the teachers whenever they want to. Online classes make people lazy and dont went them to do anything. They should get experience of going to school so they can learn more better. In my opinion in person classes are way better than the online classes. And it help students to be on time always.

Students should take the classes in person so they can attend school daily and get more active. It is totally different experience by taking classes online or in person beacuse sometimes its hard to understand from the online classes and students cant get it. Online classes are good for the students who need to graduate early and they cant have more in person classes so they can take the classes online and graduate on time. online classes make students lazy and dont they dont do it on time and they get lazy by staying at home. Online classes might be harder sometimes than the in person classes. Some people are used to online classes because they feel they are more easier for them. online classes are good for students who want to complete their all the required credits. Some people dont get time to do the online classes beacuse they have to go to work and they cant able to finish everything on time. They put more effort by going to school and sometimes they just dont feel like doing to online class. Online classes are good for those who wants to complete there courses early. Students should attend school so they learn more better. Sometimes online classes might be pressure for some students because its alot of them to do it and it depends on them whenever they want to do it and they should finish before the end of the school year and itmight be more stressful for them to complete everything soon. They should try there best to attened school beacuse it is more better than doing the online classes.

Online classes make some people lazy and they dont get experience of going to school. They should go to school and attend the classes so they can do all there work in class and get help from teachers whenever they feel difficulty beacuse getting help from online classes are harder it is a bit harder to get help from internet because some people dont understand them and it is more easier when they get help in person and they can understand everything easily and ask questions whenever they would like to. While,Some people might say yes it is better to attend online classes rather than going to school because they have to work in the morning and they dont get time to come to attend in person classes because they dont feel like going to attened them so they attend them at home. Students dont get much things in online classes and the feel difficulty sometimes and its hard for them to get some help from someone. Becasue if they go to in school classes they can get more help and they can get help for them to go to college. They can ask their counselour about how to apply for the colleges they want to get admission. They can get know whats going on in school and they can attend many activites in school and take some electives classes so they can learn more. Some people just want to take the classes online becasue they dont have the time to go to school.

Some students attend both online and in person classes beacuse they cant get enough classes at school in a year and they want to graduate on time so they take online classes so they can finish everything on time. It is little harder to attend both at a time beacuse they had to go to work too and they dont get time to do online classes. One of my friend jose he had done the same. He had to graduate on the same year but he was missing one class and he was not able to graduate on the same year so he went to his conseolur and he asked him what can he do to graduate on the same year so she gave him the idea for the online class and he started doing it. He felt it little harder but he was able to finish on time and he was able to graduate on time. Some students are always late on doing on online classes because they dont have enought time to do it If students get to in schools they get to know more about school and be more responsibility and they can get more education so they dont feel difficulty when they go to college they should always have experience of high school so they dont have any problem in college later on. And students put more effort in class because they have to get good grades so they can get good GPA and easily get admission in the college they want to. Online classes are sometimes harder depends on what class are they taking. Maths class might be harder to do in online classes beacuse you always need someone to help you because you might have so many questions and it will be harder to do maths in computer.

In conclusion,I would say it is better to take classes in school so students can learn more better and its more easier for them. In person classes are always better and students can get more help and understand better. Students can take part in activites. Students get more active by coming regularly to school. By coming to school daily it helps students to learn more and they get good experience for coming to school by making new friends and getting to know more about school. And they wont feel any difficulty beacuse there will be someone who can help them whenever they want to. By taking online classes students dont learn more like they can can learn in school classes. Students should take the online classes only if it is needed them to complete all required credits they want to graduate. Online classes might help some people and they feel more comfotable. But in my opinion i would rather take in school classes because it would help me in future by getting good experience of highschool and learn more",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,8.0
49948514DE35,"School is difficult to deal with already. No student deserves to be put in a class they do not like. That's why I think students should be able to choose what classes they would like to be in. Whether it is music , drama, or art, they should be electives not mandatory to take. Because kids don't try when they're being forced being in them, students get to choose what they want to learn, and kids feel like they have a little freedom.

To begin with, kids don't try when they don't have a choice but to take the class in which they don't like. They know many schools have a choice of choosing an elective of art, music, or drama. If kids weren't forced into it maybe the outcome of class completion would be higher because the students in the class wanted to be in there learning the stuff. Kids would choose what they would like to learn about in school besides math, english, history and science.

Next, kids learn what they probably are interested doing as an adult and are excited getting more motivated. With knowing he or she chose that class and because of themselves they're happy enjoying the material they enjoy. More pushed towards their dream of being a musician, actor, or artist. Kids get motivated when they know they've done a great job. Kids choosing the class having to do with the career they most love is a huge achievement for students. My mom onced said, ""a person's more proud when they accomplish something themselves.""

Lastly, kids love the freedom felt when they finally have a choice to make especially one determining their placements in fun classes like art, music, or drama. Students feel the greatest, smartest ones when making a big choice. Letting kids choose which to take and which not to take is a right and if someone is not letting them make choices that is evading their freedom. Students are already required a certian amount of credits in math, english, history, and science, they do not need more requirements.

However, students could have a perspective and have a chance to see these classes. Before rejecting a class they have never known about before. It could benefit their knowledge to be versatile in many things. Sometimes kids just don't know what's good for them and what's not. That is why if it would be required to students to take a drama, music, and an art class, it could change things. The children's mindets could be set and determined towards where they want to be in their future lifetime.

In conclusion, students shouldn't be required to take art, music, and drama classes. Students don't put effort into topics they dislike, they like learning what they know is right for them, and we give them more freedom and don't get into their choice-making. Kids of our future know what they are doing to be successful. ",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,7.0

101E64C9DA0E,"School cafeteria are planning to make healthier and nutrisous food for students. While applying healthier food to the menu, it could eliminate some students favorite food. convincing the principle to change the menu would be a good idea, for example, students are eating junk food for lunch, eating healthier could help students body become more active and stonger, also students may feel good about themselves for eating nutrisous food and not having to eat burgers for lunch.

Junk food isn't healthy for student do to how less active they have become. Monday through Friday students have lunch everyday and may eat the same unhealthy food. sometimes it's good to eat junk food once in a while.

Healthy and nutrisous food help students become more active and stronger. For example, nutrisous food would help students become active during their classes and after school activities. Having something small to eat like a chicken salad may help students from sleeping, being lazy to become more social, and having a healthier mindset. Students wouldn't have to worry much about getting sick or having some sort of stomach problem.

Students should feel good about themselves having to eat healthy. While students eat healthy and nutrisous meal they're keeping their body from shutting down on themselves. eating healthy effects students in good ways by keeping them fit and strong. Every student should eat healthy to keep their mindset healthy for school and ready to learn.

While the principle may eliminate some of the students favorite food it would help for the great or good. Healthy food should help students in may ways from becoming lazy to staying awake in class and to learn properly. To some students, changing the menu may be hard because some food have been eliminated and it could have been their favorite food.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,7.0
0C2179431D0C,"One topic that is frequently debated is that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Some people agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. I think that failure is not just loosing, is something that didn't know how to do something that can help people try harder. Some time being successful does not mean being great all the time cause some time is hard to keep being the same all the time. Being a failure is not a reason why people should make fun of others cause they can hurt other's feeling.

One reason failure is not just loosing, is just that some time people don't know how to do what they have to do and by that they think that they are failure. Some time when people see others that they need help instead of helping the other person they start laughing. When people can't do something they start getting mad at them self and they can hurt them self.

Second reason some time being successful does not mean being great all the time cause some time is hard to keep being the same all the time. Everyone can be successful one day but not all time cause is not easy. Sometime people try to make other look at them like they can do everything but sometime they can't do something and they can get upset.

Final reason being a failure is not a reason why people should make fun of others cause they can hurt other's feeling. Some time people can really hurt them self cause other make fun of the person that made the mistake. Some time when people are really mad at them self they can react bad and hurt others.

As you read being a failure does not mean just loosing that's not something good because that can cause someone to hurt them self. being successful doesn't mean being great all time cause is hard to be great all time without error. Some time people can make bad decision like hurt them self or react bad and hurt others.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,7.0
CD9FDD5F9F9E,"Does failure play a big role in success? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that, ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Although failure often just ends up in failure, I agree with Winston Churchill's statement that failure can lead to success if people continue to use enthusiasm.

First of all, many of our inventions used today are a result of failures.

For example, Edison created the lightbulb, but failed many times before he discovered electricity.

He used his faith and motivation to not give up and keep trying even though he had many set backs.

He accidently made a circular shaped like glass ball which became a source of electricity. If Edison did not keep trying, we would not have electricity today. Also, many scientists have created medicines after many failed attempts.

For instance, there is now a chicken pox shot that prevents people from getting the chicken pox.

Through many experiements with mixure of chemicals and failed trials, scientists were eventually able to find a shot that prevents chicken pox from entering your system. These examples show that failures often lead to success if people never give up trying.

Second of all, many students have failed in school, but if they keep trying and keep their enthusiam, they will succeed. For example, I have had a hard time in school, especially with passing my sol's. When time goes on, I try harder and harder, and spend more time studying with my teacher.

As of today, I have passed all of the sol's I need in order to graduate except for the one I am writing about right now.

I also have a learning disability and ADHD and have a hard time paying attention and often lose focus in my classes.

Even with my disability, I have not given up and keep coming to school and get extra help from my teachers so that I can graduate this year.

I make sure I follow the rules, don't skip class, or don't miss school becuase it's so hard for me to make up what I miss. Although many seniors like to skip class, I do not skip becuase I want to earn a high school diploma. Even in education, there are failures, but through hard work and a good attitude, students can succeed.

In conclusion, I agree with Chruchill's statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of entusiasm.""

Even though people will experience failures, there will be success if they work hard, keep the enthusiiasm, and never give up. ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5.0,9.0
F3604BAC5D79,"I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill because in my opinion, the failure makes to the people strong and the next time they can do it better. Sometimes we are making failures day per day, but if we become sad and we are closed that we can not do it again, we are losing something important in our life, but if we are doing it with enthusiasm we can improve our failures and do it better every time. Success is the achievement of doing what you have tried to do or what to do. Winston Churchill is referring that no one have to loss the enthusiasm, however if you are making mistakes in your life and you are saying that you can not do it and you will try it but you are going to get the same results and you are giving excuse by excuse you will fail in your life because you are giving up easily and you dont see that every cost and fight at the end it has a benefit or something that you really wanted to get or a goal that you are trying to reach and you will see that you dont have to loss the hope and the enthusiasm in every dream that you want.

The failure has an important role in the pursuit of success, sometimes a lot of people do not have the enthusiasm and they think that it is the end of everything, the failure can be the destruction for a lot of people, but if you make a lot of mistakes and you are keeping fighting still to get your goals you will see how important is not give up easy and watch the positive part of your failures. When Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" he is only saying that sentence but it has a big meaning everybody can apply it in their lives, you can find the best outcomes just smiling to the problems. It does not mean that you will not care the problems, of course you have to resolve the problems and make them clear, because if you are making failures and people is affected and you dont care you just want to get your outcomes it will be a big problem, no body needs to be involved in your failures because the people around you will see that you are making a mistake and you are selfish.

Churchill's statement has big meanings and has good outcomes, everybody wants success but what happen when someone is trying to get success and miss? of course everyone will feel so sad and no one wants to try it again because the person is afraid of their failures, it is like if the failure is tying you and it does not want to leave you. The persons will be sad and their hopes will be down because they think that they are going the get the same outcome, but what happen if you raise your head with enthusiasm? Winston is trying to say us that the enthusiasm is very important to get the success because if you have enthusiasm you will fight with love for something that you really want. An enthusiasm person has more possibilities to get success than a person sad, broken and a person who is thinking just negative thoughts or who is close that they will get the same result and give up easily like nothing will happen if he/she is going to try it.

The enthusiasm has an important role in the success because you will keep your head up and keep fighting for your goals all the time and every time that you will make a failure it will be more easy to resolve it, because you have a key and you are enrolling every time when you get one failure. The enthusiasm help to the people to see the answer of the problems easily because the brain will be relaxed and will think the best things, however, when the brain is frustrated the brain can not think correctly. So, if you are enthusiasm you will do it very good because you want something that you want and also it will be something that will improve your life not just in the success of work or study it can be in all your whole life you can get success and everything if you apply this in your life, and the people around you like your family will see how important is this role in the life and they will want to learn about the enthusiasm in the failures and they will understand that sometimes we dont need to destroy ourselves or lost the head in something that we can resolve in an easy way that enthusiasm is helping us to improve ourselves.

I agree with Churchill's statement because the enthusiasm it is an important role you can motive to other people to be enthusiasm and they can resolve their problems using the same method. Sometimes the failure are really hard to resolve but if you really want to reach it you have to feel enthusiasm because I think that automatically you will see the answer clearly and easily and if you are frustrated your brain will not work and will be closed and sometimes when we are frustrated we are getting extras failure because we dont think clearly and we dont think about it. Sometimes we have to learn a lot from the failure and we dont see it, the failure can be some steps just to reach the success and the goods outcomes. Winston is showing us that the failure can be defeated it does not matter how long it is going to take but before the success you have to keep strong and smiling to the big failure. Winston Churchill is using a statement that means that we dont have to give up easily we have to fight for something that we want to make real.

Example: The success in the school can be really difficult and more than one time we can fail because we dont do homework but we want to pass, so if we want to reach this goal we have to enthusiasm ourselves because we have a goal that we want to reach, so we are going to fix our failure and we are going to do everything because after school we want to go to college and get a good job.

In conclusion, the Churchill's statement has an important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The failure is just a difficult step to reach the success and with enthusiasm we can defeat to the failures. The enthusiasm is a supply very important in the enroll for the success.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0
3F722ACC887E,"To conserve energy and resources some businesses have adopted a four day work week and consisting of 10 hours per day, everybody are different everybody do they want so can be good or can be bad.

I'm disagree because for me is the same thing that the businesses adopted a four day week that consist of 10 hours of work, because if they work the 6 day's at week doing 8 hours at the end is the 40 hours at week same with if you work 10 per day in four day's at the week.

When the businesses make the people work the 10 hours per day in four day's week the people get more tired and most people do workout in the morning or in the night and i think that if you work 10 hours per day you dont going to do your workout because your going to be tired and the only thing your going to do is sleeping

If the school follow the same model and extending school day two hours for some student is going to be good but at the time no because if the students come to school for four day and add two more hours they will be in home doing nothing and they can play all day in video games, and that cant get more energy, for other student can be bad because some students work after school and that can affect them.

As you read sometimes you get benefits and sometimes disadvantages one of the best benefits can be that you conserve energy and one of the best disadvantages is that your body can be tired, but at the end is going to be the same thing that businesses want four day week that consist of 10 hours per day or that businesses work 8 hours per day and there be the 40 hours at week referent with school they dont have to follow the businesses because students need to learn.

6586DF43A92D,"I agree with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill when he said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Because we are all failures, but we all succed in life, if we work hard. Success is not going to come to us as esay as pie "" we go to success"". To go to success we have to be failures in a consistent matter but we learn from being a failure, to fix our mistakes. Knowing that we want a better future and that we want to be successful in many things such as in school, work, sports and many other things we have in life ,that we want to become successful gives us enthusiasm eventhough if fail to do good at moments. Trying hard and keep tryin till you reach success helps us to keep our enthusiasim.

Being successful in school well help us in our daily life. We will go from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiasim. We know that by being successful in school we are going to have many opportunities in life. Being a failure is not bad, it makes us strong to keep trying more and more. To graduate from high school we all need to pass a certain amount of SOL. Sometimes we pass the SOL some times we dont,Thats what leads us to success because we are going from failure to failure but with enthuisasim ,since we keep trying and trying till we pass the SOL. Because we know that passing the SOL is leading us to success and that we have to work hard and go to success because its not going to come to us if we loss our enthusiasim to keep trying.

Work can make us go from failure to failure ,but enthusiasim well take us to success. Being successful in work may be hard that it might make us feel down or even make us feel like giving up. But always working hard and with alot of enthusiasim will help us succeed and acomplish many things such as getting a higher payment and getting a better employment can be possible if we always work hard towards success and with enthusiasim. Keeping enthusiasim is good because it doesnt only helps you to be motivated to keep working hard towards your goal / Success, but it helps your peers as well since your transmitting them the good vibe and enthusiasim. Others well succed too since your transmitting the good vibe/ enthusiasim to them they will be inspired by you.

Playing a sport is not easy. Alot of practice and dedication is required to because successful in a sport. Becoming successful in a sport will take you from being a failure and to a failure once again . But if you really want to succed in that specific sport that you like ,you will have to try and keep trying with enthusiasim. Trying with enthusiasim willl help you become successful in that sport that you like and that you have been practicing with your dedication and enthusiasim.

Others may say that "" Success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"". People say this because they dont try as hard, if they get things wrong at first they give up. People wotn try to work hard and go to success they just give and wait for success to come to them (THATS NEVER HAPPENNING!!!). People also say this ("" success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"") because they find it impossible that enthusiasim gives you the strength to keep trying.

Since they are the ones who are the failure that wont work with the enthusiasimto succeed.

Being a failure is not bad. Working to success with the loss of enthusiasim just because we fell a couple of times is bad. Because if we dont work to success and lose our enthusiasim we will never succed in anything we will just live our daily life as a failure. We are all failures but if we work hard we will become a better failure, A failure that succeed in life not a failure who just gives up and loses its enthusiasim. Working to go to success with enthusiasim will help you accomplish your goals and also it will inspire others. Others will also get the same energy as you and will work towards success with enthusiasim.

By setting a good example can inspire the youth to change, some people take actions more seriously than words in addition promises can be broken but actions can be marked for example the word hypocrite defines the opposite of something that has been said therefor words can't be taken seriousy than actions; On the other hand actions can inspire people to do better, some people look up to their parents or relatives, not because of what they have said but because of their actions on showing good behavior.

By setting an example from your own behavior can also change people to become better human beings, in additon when some people are surrounded by the wrong group they are most likely to become one of them, for example if you're raised by someone who has a good behavior and a great personality, you are most likely to grow up with great behavior and being a respectful person, often it's not what you hear but it's the actions that you observe in other human beings; people can change because of the type of behavior that surrounds them, not always because of words that are being told.

Many people pay attention to action rather than words, It's easier for surtain people to become more influenced by actions; most of the time if you are being told not to do something wrong you are most likely to end up doing the opposite, sometimes no matter how hard you try to give someone a good advice they won't taking it therefore i believe that words are weaker than actions.

In conclution I believe by setting an example by your own behavior is a good way to inspire other people, it's not about words it's about showing good examples.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,6.0
3BEF322748A1,"Imagine that you got a project in your college and in that project you have to interact with different people and you have to write about their lives, but now you will be thinking that it is really difficult project to do because in all those previous years of high school all you did was to avoid people.

Some people believe that technology saves your time as you can buy or sell things online. However, so much use of technology effect your eyes and brain in a negative way.

Therefore, usage of technology should be made less and people should interact with each other more, because the more friends you will have the less you will go in the depression.

Use of technology have a lot of negative effects on people's lives. Too much use of technology weakens your communication skills with other people. Recently it has been said that there are some kind of radiations on your phone and other electronics which affects your brain and body in a negative way. Too much use of phones, laptops and television can weak your eye sight making it difficult for you to see.

Some people say that technology can be used for different kind of resources . On the other hand, it can also leads you towards the cyber crime which is really bad for you, because if you are caught once doing that crime the rest of your life you will be in jail.

Now a days, if you will go outside, in many places you will see that there will be friends or family sitting on the same table but no one is talking with each other, everyone is on their devices.

There are many people in today's world who do suicide or are in depression just because they think they have no one to whom they can talk and can share their problems.

For example, if there is some one is trying to talk to you and is trying to be your friend but you are busy in using your phone and the next day you came to know that the person who was trying to talk with you yesterday did suicide today because that person thought that he had no one to whom he can talk. So you will blame yourself and you will regret at that time for not talking with that person.

Hence, people should interact with each other more and more and they should try to know about each other life intead of using their devices all the time. People should spend more time with their families because not everything is found on Google,there are somethings which you learn by spending time with your family and your family will be the only one who will be with you every time, in your good and bad days, but your devices will not be with you and also they will not support you at that time.

When I grow up I would like to be a loryol becaues I wanna help people,what they going throw and also make there life more better.

My first reason I wanna be a loryol is becaues I wanna help people and I dont like seen people sad or see someone mad. I wanna make this a better place where people will not talk about them like how they look like or where they from and also how they dress. For example I had a girl bestfriend and people will always talk about her how she look like or where she came from. She wanted to do some bad just becaues what people will say about her like bad things. I wanna let eveyone know that just becaues someone say some bad about you dont mean you have to do those bad things like try to kill your self,cut your self. people just mad becaues your cute and pertty and there are not.

The seacon reason is what are people going throw because some people are so mean that they dont even know what they doing. If I see someone cry and not feeling good. I would tell you what happend to them. For example my mom was going throw some bad things when she was little she had her friends that will be right next to her and tell her how she feel and my mom will tell her what is going on.

The last reason I wanna be a loyol is becaues I wanna make there lifes better not feel like they are somewhere bad and I wanna tell them that someone will always be here for you.

First, the technology help when you don't know something, for example when you have homework and you need some answer you can look and Google. When you need know how do model or some project you can watch videos in YouTube and follow the instruction. When you don't how explain something you can to teach one images in some web side and show.

Second, can help the person need, for example when you not speak the same language to one friend or you travel some where and you need to speak you can use the Translator. Or when you have one emergency and is urgent you call the 911 and the police go quick to place. When you need know something in special only use Google and this show you many web side with many information maybe can help you.

For example, the inform more quick, for example you don't know today is rain or is cold you only need to look the climate in your phone and you have the answer. When something happen and is bad in your country or some place your phone notify with one messenger. When you have the long time you not talk with your mom and can't visit you call and is more quick.

Also some people thing the use of technology had negative effect's on people's live because when something is many easy the people got lazy or when you use the phone not put attention to anything because you only concentrated in your phone; however, the technology is one resource can help to many forms.

AC692F322516,"I personally disagree using cell phones in classroom, because students will not get the education they need. Students can go on other pages without teachers knowing like looking up something that they are not suppose to. It also can distract others focusing on their work, or studying for a test. It may cause an issue for teachers for allowing students using their cell phones in the classroom. Students using their cell phones can lose focus on the work that is given.

Cell phones can cause problems in the classrooms; while students are doing their own work and can not use a cellular device, while taking a test. Using any cellular device while doing any work or taking a test can get into problems by the teacher and it counts as cheating. Students can also lose their cell phones during class or losing it while going to the restroom. Students can get in trouble by other teachers using it in their classroom, can get in trouble for using it while walking, or hitting someone by accident or making someone fall. Students do not see where they are going to doing around them.

Using cellular devices will not help students learn the materials that is given. Students can get distracted on the work that is given to them and not attend to do it. Students need the education that the teachers has provided for them. So, students need to stay focus on the work and stay on task on the class work, students can genially have their cellular device off ,so is does not keep them from learning. Using cellular device can effects students thinking on a subject in class.

Teachers may not know what students are doing, on their cellular device in the classroom. It can cause problems for students if they are not using their cellular device properly in class. Teachers do not know if students are saying inappropriate comments to others students. Students can also send inappropriate images among other students.

Although, using the cellular device is not the best device for doing work or studying on a subject, that they have to do. Provided the knowledge that is given to students and stay on task when is need that way, it helps you not to get lost, but it also can provide students to learn and not to use their phones. More students lose track on time and whats around them. Using cellular devices can stop you from not doing the job quicker. It can slow the work and lesson that is given to them.

Should people guiadance from experts and authorities about life's important matter or should people make their own decisions? Why make own decision is better?

Generic_School, have different kind of career that student can choose for study in their life, also there is people who help to select which subject is better, they make opinion about why you have to take that career. Hear ideas and opinions sometime make you to do best things and get successful in the life.

Some students are thinking about choose Science, Why they prefer Science?, They believe that science could bring it better opportunities in their life, for example: Exist important people who created tools that are availabe to save life of people. There is more people who invented different kind of instruments, the microscope is one, this tool really that is very important, this one help us to see stars more close or any other thing that are a far of us. Those are some examples that why we took the decision of choose Science, does not matter what the instructors of the University said.

Generic_School, also have the career of study History, some guys voted for that one, But Why?, just because for a few reason, one of them is that they want to learn more about how each war started, Life's Presindents, etc. History is a great subject that teach us many important events that we even dont know that was real in the life, however, at end of the day just you have the option to do waht you like and want.

When we have the option of working individually or in group, some people may choice i different choice of how they would like to work for different reasons, some people may like to work in groups because they feel that may have more possibilities of talking to their friends or someone that they like, or they may feel that they work may get complicated or may take longer and that they may need help to accomplish it,so they would like to work in group to get help and to finish the work faster.

Some people that would like to work individually may chose that choice because maybe they like to be alone and work by themselves,or maybe because they feel that they okay and that they don't need the help from anyone else to finish or do the work.

In some cause on school, teachers sometimes don't like or don't prefer students working in groups because they want to see if they know how to do the work and if they can actually do it by themselves, or sometimes they worry that one person won't do the work and just let the rest of the people in the group do the work,or just do wherever the other guys are doing, or copy work from them, is true that it could happen in some occasions, but is not always like that,and the reasons why it would be good to allow students to work in group would be that, if every student knows how to the work,then every student can participate doing a different activity on the group and cooperate with anyone, or if the student doesn't know how to do the work, then he\she can get help from his/her partners to explain the him/her how to do the work ,and them she/he can be able to do the work,and they all can be able to participate in the activities.

Has a conclusion, it would be better do work in groups, because in that way it could be easier to get the work done, because you can get help from others in the work,and it would be more fun because you can work with your friends at the same time that they do the work, and it could also be another way of how to met people and make new friends when sometimes you have to work with people that you don't know, and for the people that like to work by themselves, maybe they should know all those benefits of working with people, but is they think that they have no problem working by themselves or that they can get the work done by themselves, then that should be okay to.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,7.0

And if we make it longer there are going to be parent's that are going to be waiting for there child to take them to the football, soccer games and then when they come home its going to be late beacause like they want to change the hours they are not going to have enough time to do anything there going to go home to homework and then when you know it it arleady like 8pm and you have to go to bed. And we arleady wake up at 7am and then coming back home and it's like 5pm-6pm it's stress out kicking out stuff that you do but now you can't to beacause they put more time in School.

And i think it sucks beacause there are kids that go to my school that live in Generic_City and it take along time to come to school and go back home from school beacause i've lived in Generic_City before and it suck when i stay after school i get home like at 7pm-8pm and it's sucks so it better to not make school longer beacause there are kid that live pretty far and there are going to get home late and then they have to get there homework done too. so it's dummy hard work to get that on time. And us as chidren its going to ruined are shecdule and are parent's to maybe we have not go to soccer or any activity that we take just beacause they put more time in school it going to suck being in a class room for 80 mintues now. it's to be trieding.

They meant if we get a half an hour of more school they start giving us more homework then we mostly get and doing that for just 3 hours that we get just beacause they want to add more time it's going to be hard for everybody and they teacher if they live far it's going to be hard beacause at 6pm thats when all rush hour are so much traffic and there going to come home late and when they come home late there going to be grading work and then waking up at 5pm to go back to work and that trieding doing that smae rountine for there whole life it hard I dont even go to work and i'm like wow if that happens it going to be bad.

Another thing that why would should have on more half an hour is beacause we wake up early and have another half hour kicking ints not far if they want to do that they should a least change they school time and wake up like at 8am or something beacuase its not far wake up early and then leaving so late it should be the oppsite wake up late and leave school early it going to be better beacause then everybody going to kbe happeir no one is going to be in a bad mood and it's going to be chill and then .

to continue, the second reason is because they get sleeping to late at night and wake up to late, for example they can get sleeping late at night watching TV or playing video games with they friends.

suddenly she cross the final line ; Everyone was screaming from joy. Most teenagers can't participate in any extracurricular activity for different reasons.

For example, in Generic_Name experience was because she had to look after her brothers.

Occasionally teenagers look for ways to spend time doing what they like. In fact, there have been many cases where teenagers use a sport to feel less stress or to spend more time with their friends, for these reason teenagers should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Recently researches discovered that kids that are more active in their life-style can concentrate more than kids that stay in their houses doing nothing all day, like when

Generic_Name was practicing the sport she start making new friends and loving the progress she was making every day.

Generic_Name parents felt surprise because their daughter was following her dream. Some parents think sports are a waste of time and that you are not going to needed in the future, although its going to help you in the future in many ways . For example, before Generic_Name was in the team of runners she felt tired all the time, but went she start practicing she was more active . Most teenagers don't like sports, as a result of that the principal add more things you can do. Know you can decide what do you want to do after school.

I like the idea for students to participate in an extracurricular activities because students will have an activity to do after school and the will spend more time with there friends. If there is a student that don't have any friends this will help them make friends and learn new things. Teenagers should do at least one sport or participate in other activities for their own good.

That inspired me used all those factors that where making me fail and improving them to make me a better actress.

In school/classroom always fail in sols, test, and quizzes but those students never give up trying and after trying and studying students succeed in their test.

In a community everybody tries to help out trying to catch people that break in peoples houses, but never do. The people made a list of the things they were doing wrong and they very upset people stopped trying. Until one day one person broke in to a house and instead of doing nothing like the people said the made a successful plan to catch the criminal. The planed worked and then community celebrated their success and for not giving up.

One of the most famous soccer player in the world Lionel Messi also has failed on the field whether it is on penalties, shooting, or speed he always tries to be better and all his failure has made him one of the best soccer players in the world.

Success in life.

Former British Primer Minister Winston Churchill once said that ''success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Life get harder when people are trying to reach their goals. Not losing the enthusiasm is the key for people to get success. Sometimes when people fail they gain skills that can help for the future. Success consist of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because people earn experience and people get proud.

First, Success consist of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because people earn experience. For example, Generic_Name was trying to be a teacher and move out of her parents house,her parents were telling her that she cannot move out of her house because that will be a lot of responsibility she did not pay attention to their advise and she move, After three months she didn't have money to pay her bills and she give up with everything and move out with her parents. Even thought people do not reach their dreams they learn from what they did and also that can be beneficiary for the future. To restate, people get experience that will help them for later.

Second, Success consist of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because people get proud. For example, Generic_Name want to pass her math exam but she wasn't sure if she could pass the exam because it was the harder exam and because of that exam depend if she graduate or not, she study for 2 days and she get to pass the exam and she graduate. When people try hard they can accomplish their goals even through is difficult. To restate, working hard and not giving up is the way to be success.

Some people may say that success do not consist of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. This point has merit because what would people try again if they fail the first time. However, success consist of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because life is about fall and stand up. For example, Generic_Name was a man that use to have the better cars, the better phone, the one with the most money in his country, one day one girl came and he fall in love and she stole all his money and he ends with no money and no friend and sleeping in the streets, One year late work at a Barber shop and he gain to recover his life. To restate, even though life gets hard and people treason us with out knowing how hard we work for the stuff that we have life keep going and we can get over it.

To summarize, success consist of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. For example, people get new skills and experience, also people get proud of themselves when they accomplish they goals and dreams that they are being achieving. And lastly, people dont want to try if they know they are going to be success. Therefore, Failure plays a important step of all the people life that people can never forget. Never loss the enthusiasm is important to reach our dreams.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,8.0

First, people said the first impressions can change because most are not the same as people see. For example, Generic_Name it a quiet girl when she not know the people but when she can trust the person she is different girl. people in the first impressions seem a different person as when people know the person. people can impress by they way they are change personality when they know and trust the person. Most people change they personality and being a different person.

Second, people said first impressions can change becuase people can sorprises them by they action.

Generic_Name were not felling cofident with the others boy he is friendly but when he don't trust he being other person. Starting his action changes being a quiet boy when he don't know the person. The first impresions can change by sorprises them by they action of beign other person and don't having trust.

For example, at first day of schools Generic_Name was a quiet girl and new in the school Generic_Nameis insocial she don't have friends Generic_Name first imperssion saying at the first time he tought she was social but it was impossoble to he believe that. Generic_Name was not impossible to change others mind of her impressions. However, people can change their impressions if they turst that person then people are going to think different of others. people can change people mind by the way they are.

Some people say that our first impressions are i't's something that we can't change, while others say that our first impression it's easier to change. I think, that our first imprssions are literally impossible to change, even when you know that it has have impacted in your life.

It's really hard to change something like the way I am, how I interact to other people is something that my parents has teach me since I was little, most of the time I happy I love interact with good attitude to other people.

For example, I always like to show up good expression for all the people.

those are things that I never going to change. In fact, I always like show up same personality.

Sometimes change expressions or for get expressions are impossible. For example, when you really love someone, it's really hard to even that everything is done but you still in love with that person your expressions still the same with that person. in fact, sometimes even that we want to change our expressions we can't.

In conclusion, sometime i'ts really hard to change the way you are, and is more hard when you usually act and do the same every day. In my case I never will change my expressions my personality and I always will be the same.    ",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,5.0

My point of view is that we all have choice's we make to better our selves to make us better people in the world but some of the choice's we make as human's can lead us to a wrong path. We as people have to set goal's for the future and plan ahead to accomplish them. One thing i learn while being incarcerated you got to value yourself more than you value other's, if you dont value yourself what's the point for setting up goal's if all they going to do is collect dust.

Everybody haves different opinion's some people might think the world is at fault for the choice's they make and thats not true, people blame others when they know their in the wrong or done something wrong than try to say it's the other person's fault. I'll say is, with everything going on in the world we got to get together and help each other more and come together as a team NO! more as a family, when one of us fall down we lift each other up, if one of us get's hurt we heal each other. There's got to be thing's we can do, hard time's dont last forever at these moment's we got to remember how far we come from hard time's when things didnt look good for us.

B5FF33681C22,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more. Attending a school can get you ready in the real world then just attending classes from home.

Those who say attending classes from home say that because teacher cant teach the way they want. They have to follow the way the schools wants you to learn. For example, the teacher does not want to teach some of the stuff hes given but he has to because at the end of the day this is his job and he does not want to lose his job. When your attending classes from home you have more sleep and you wont be tired because it will be at your own time. And also you dont have to be in a class that the teacher dont really like to teach because over time some teachers lose that feeling that they loved.

However, people believe that attending schools is way better then just staying home. Some reasons you should attend school then stay home is that you will have more fun in a class room then just home all the time. For example, you will make friends and do stuff together the will make your time more joy able then just at home. you wake up and go to school you see your friends and you make jokes and help each other and it is limitless.

Another reason you should attend school then classes at home. Schools have field trips,sports,after school activities that you will probably love to do. Because you have the chance to try all of them at school. For example, there are filed trips to the art museum that have great at works like the monalisa. And filed trips to New York and other places that you will love to see. Sport teams are like family, you watch each others back and help improve you game together and thats something you cant get from home or video conferencing. Other reason why you should attend school with others is that someday you will find a bond with someone or a group that will last and you will be grateful for. For example, There were couples in high school that later on got married and there were these groups that became friends actually the became family.

In conclusion, Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more.

In my life i have learn many thing like i never think i do like maintenance in toys, fix computers, and other things.

And i like my teacher teach very well because is one way to learn better others teachers dont like teach very well or just like to be angry with the students in the class and thats the reason why the students say i dont like the teacher because is angry or dont teach very well.

Give examples is the vest way to understand thing like i never understood. behavior is other thing how behavior we are in the class or in the house, our behavior is one part important in the life because the the others peoples could say that person have a good behavior i would like he can tell me a advice or example how to make this or fixed.

There is one more way is read newspaper, watch the news, ask peoples, ask questions, there are so many ways.

A good example is see how much you can do, how much do you know, dont matter what kind of color you are, you are special for everyone from the most youngest until the most oldest, every one can give a little knowledge how much he know.

There are many advice we can use to exhibit our effort and value, many peoples come to me and they ask me for a question or advice they tell me everything they want to say because they trust on me, i am the people like listening another when they need help.

430C1B16922B,"Imagine how awesome could be if we have only four-day school and three days off. We can spend these three days with our family in parks, rivers and lakes. Or traveling to other states. Or traveling to other countries!! With the condition that have to stay two more hours each school day to finish all our works before leave the school. Would you accept it? I think that school should have four-days school week, and extending the school day two hours because all the students could to learn more and finish their works each day and teachers with students would have more time to spend with their families during the weekends.

All the students could learn more and finish their works each day if the day is extending two more hours. For example, imagine that you are in technology class and your teacher says, ""Type this lesson in the computer then I'll teach you how to save it.""

So, you are at the middle part of typing the lesson, but is time to go home, you don't know how save the lesson in the computer because the teacher doesn't taught you, if there is not more time to teach you to save it. What do you think that it goes to happens to the lesson for the next day, if you can't save it and you turned off the computer?

What do you think that could happens? However, if you have two more hours of school day you can finish the lesson. Further, the teacher has more time to teach you how to save before turn off the computer. This shows that extending the school two hours, students can finish their works on time and learn more.

The teachers and students would have more time to spend with their familes during the weekends. For example, the normal school days are five and two day off, which are Saturday, and Sunday. However if school follow the model to change it to four-day school week: all students and teachers would have one more day off to spend with their families. Now, they would have three days free to spend, which are Friday, Saturday and Sunday. They could could spend the three free days going to the beach, park and visit other states. Without worry that they have only two free days. This proves that changing the five-day school to four-day school week is going to benefit students and teachers.

Some students said that changing the five-day school to four-day school week and extending the school day two hours wouldn't benefit them. They are wrong because changing to four-day school week and extending school day two hours, would benefit them to gain one more day to spend with their families, two more hours of school day to get finish their work and they can learn more.

In the future, I hope the school follow the model to change the five-day school week to four-day school week and extend the school day two hours.

0A80A992E9AA,"Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early? Some people might argue whether if it is a good idea or not. In my opinion, I think it is a good idea to give an opportunity to some students to finish high school in three years if they deserved and have worked hard for it, even sacrificing their elective courses and their time during summer or after school. Some people might not agree with this statement because they think students are too young to be acting as an adult and have adults responsibilities. However, I personally think it is a good idea for some students to finish high school in three years because some students can be doing something better in their fourth high school year out of school, some students would like to graduate as soon as possible, and students can learn how to be responsible at an early age.

First, students can be doing something better in their fourth high school year out of school. I think students could be doing something more important in that fourth high school year out of school than wasting their time in school in their fourth year. For example; a student could be going to college one year early and finish his/her career early as well, and have a better life at an early age. Students could plan their life and do productive things in that fourth year in high school and sometimes that's the reason why they want to graduate early. However, some students plan to graduate early because they think, they could be doing something more important than wasting one more year in high school.

Next, some students would like to graduate as soon as possible. Some students would like to graduate early because they might not like school or being in school, and they just trying to graduate. Some students might want to graduate as soon as possible because they want to be successful at an early age. We have to understand that sometimes some students don't live with their parents and they need to be working but they want to graduate at the same time, and I think giving students an opportunity to graduate in three years would help them a lot. For example; one of my friends told me that he was trying to graduate early because he does not have the support of his parents to be spending his time in school, so he can graduate early and work so he can have a normal living and be a successful person in life. However, Students have a lot of reasons in why they want to graduate as soon as possible.

Finally, students can learn how to be responsible at an early age. I think finishing high school in three years would help students grow mentally since they getting out from school one year early. Students would have responsiblities of an adult at an early age and I think that is a good thing which is going to help them in many ways. Their moral would be stronger, and they would learn how to deal with hard things in life. For example; there are many teenagers in high school that are not responsible, and I think If they had a chance to graduate early, they would take it and maybe they can learn how to be responsible in life. However, If students would graduate early, I think they would be way more responsible than they are.

In conclusion, Is it a good idea to graduate from high school in three years? Well in my personal opinion, I think it is a good option for some students since not all students want the same thing. Students with their credits and all the things that they need in order to graduate, I think they should graduate in three years. Students with important goals in life should considered finishing high school in three years. Some people might think that finish high school in three years is not a good idea because they think teenagers are not ready for the world and for the responsibilities that life require. However, I agree with this statement, I think finish high school in three years is a good idea because students can be doing something better in their fourth high school year out of school, some students would like to graduate as soon as possible, and students can learn how to be responsible at an early age.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,8.0

Calories are based on what you eat,eating unhealthy will make you gain weight while eating healthy will help you balance out calories. Eating healthy will help reduce the chances of being obesity.

Eating a health meal during school will make the students be productive during school. Biting into an apple is the same thing, as drinking a sip of coffee. If we don't serve healthy food the chances of being active in school will decreases. If we serve our students unhealthy food than they will be lazy throughout the day. Giving the students a healthy meal will make them be more productive.

Therefor serving your students a health meal for lunch will help them accomplish obstacles in school. Serving your students will help them improve of being smart. Knowing that if you serve your students healthy options on what to eat they will not be obese. Productive is based on what we eat. If you serve unhealthy food you the chances of being smart,being fit,and active in school will decrease.        ",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,5.0
3CB26FC60794,"STUDENTS SHOULD COMMIT TO A CARRIER IN A CARRIER IN HIGH SCHOOL

What is a career? A career can be broadly defined. It is the general progression of one's life, especially in ones profession, a chosen profession or occupation, a path of course. A career is basically what everyone who wants to be successful in life, should take seriously in school before they graduate from high school, university, or even community colleges. Everyone's should at least know what the course they want to study before graduating from high school.

However, Growing up as kids we watched all different kinds of entertainment; movies, music, shows and all kinds of other entertainment scenarios As kids we always admire some many type of people, and we always wanted to be like them when we grow up. Some kids that watch adventures movies always thought that they could fly when they grow up, some other kids who loves musics, always thought of being a world superstar, they also taught that they could go to the moon and play/walk as long as they want. Also eat till until their stomachs gets exploded.

Furthermore, the older we get, the more knowledge we acquire about our social environment and community. We see how things are been done both the right way and the wrong way. We know the 'do's and don'ts' of our community. Some people will decide to do the don'ts of the community; stealing, fighting in school, being disrespectful, not being honest, bullying, coming to school very late or even not showing up to school, not doing the right things they are supposed to do at all times, killing, joining bad social groups in both school, and outside school, telling lies, taking part in examination malpractice during examination, quizzes or test in school. Other people will decide to do the right things; not fighting in school, keeping their grades up, joining good social clubs in school that will benefit them greatly in future, not cheating during examinations, quizzes or tests in school, coming to school early, completing their school task and other kinds of good things.

Moreover, going through high school, some students think they know the course they want to study when they graduate from high school, because they think it is easy, and they could just simply take the course and graduate from high school. While some other students don't even know the course they want to study in high school before they graduate. Parents of most students don't really know what their kids are capable of doing,(weakness and greatness) they just want them to be a Doctor, Nurse or some other kinds of scientificial career. Most parents want their kids to be a scientist, so that they could bring money to the family. This is not really a good idea because, not all students has the capability of completing the tasks required for some of the science classes in school and passing them. Students have their greatness and weaknesses in all classes. I oppose that they should be a counselors confress meeting at least three times in every school year, for all students, so they could know where their weakness and greatness is, and they could be able to decide what they really want to do in college confidently.

In conclusion, if students in high school know what they really want to do in high and school and college before graduating, they would do the right things that they are supposed to do and they gonna find out that it's going to be more easier for them.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,6.0

In my opinion these type of classes help to students to develoment abilities physical or mental, and help to founding a job in future by learning art and music. The art class help to control the character of many students have imperative problems.

students develop abilities physical or mental,in music class. They learning who to used diffrents instruments like guitar or flute. Students maintains busy their mind and help students to be ouside of drug or alcohol. Students apresiate more beuties and have better actittuded towar their sircunstanceans.

The students have better oportunities to founding a job. When they finish higtt schools, they need money for university. They could used their skills for apply to a part-time while study in the university at the same time practice their skills, and they have more oportunities to get the job.

Art class help to many students have imperactive problems because they learning who to draw, coloring painting. For all thise need patience for the reason they became patience. Many parents think, these classes should be electives because this type of classes don't seem to used every day.

I disagree we don't have to challenge other person's to do better. Some people they are satisfied what they have,for example job,school, and other activities. may be they still in high school and they are no ready to go to the next level to go the college.

Does your parent ever said, ""You play on your phone 24/7!"" Students should get involve in at least one extracurricular activity at school because students can makes new friends, they get to experience new things that they never done before, and help students express them self to others. Students can choose up to 25 different activities to do after school like sports, art, clean the school, and a lots more different activities. This help students get involve with their school.

When students is participating the extracurricular activities, they can make new friends. When making new friends, they are introducing them self to other students. This can improves their communication and social skills with other, good communication can also help students when they are in school or in the outside world. Additionally, they also get to a better understanding of the other students personality. For example, a student can shared their past experience with another student, discuss what they have in common, their goals, and about their friends and family.

The students get to experience new thing that they never done before. They get to find out what they enjoy, and get to know a little bit of them self. Students can express them self through activities like art, sports, and music etc. Students get to learn new skills throughout the variety of activities, and later students can shared their skills that they have learned to other students or family member. Students also get to learn about different career, subject, languages, and etc. Later, it can help them in life when they are adult.

It can help students get involve with activities. Back when there is no electronic, every kid play outside, and not a single kid hated going outside. Children were energetic, they love outdoor activities and playing with friends. Today generation is different, 10 years old boy playing video games all day, and children spending 4 hours everyday playing on their phone. If we have extracurricular activities at school, then more students would get involve in activities. Parent can also get involve by supporting their children.

In conclusion, there are many benefit when it comes to getting students involve in an extracurricular activities. Students can make new friends, they get to experience new thing, and get to express them self through the activities. Some may say if every students have to get involve in an extracurricular activities. Then, it just going to limit the time that the students get to spend with their family. However, is it going to change anything if parent don't get their children involve in activities? The students is just going to keep playing their phone 4 hours every single day. If parent don't wan't their kid to be 24/7 on their phone. Then, get them involve in an activities at school. ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,7.0
0E4059713969,"Why would we add another hour and a half to school? I say we should not add 1 and a half hours to school. Some reasons are because school is already boring with the hours we already have, kids may have things to do in the afternoons,and it may be too much time already in school we don't need to add more time.

First, I think that schools should not add 1 and a half hour to school because school is already exhausting, and many kids are tired of it. They have to wake up early go to school and stay seated for at least 5 hours. Many kids can't stay seated very long so its very difficult for us to stay seated for that long. And when they get to school they are all tired

Next, Many kids might have plans in the afternoon and if you add more time to school than you might be disturbing there free time. Many parents are very strict so kids may have a curfew and adding more time will make them have less time to enjoy themselves. Also if they have family things they have to do than school is interfering in the way of them doing their personal things.

Finally, We already have too much time in school. Many people say that most of your day is in school, and they are right because we arrive at 8:00am and dont leave until 3:15pm. Kids already don't like the time we have to be in school so why should yall add more. Many kids will just always complain about the hours in school.

Many kids find it boring, they think we already have enough hours at school, and they might have personal things to do after school. So in conclusion thats why think that they should not add an hour and a half to school.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,7.0
4585DE769AE9,"I don't believe the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. First of all, the research showing there is a lot of chance to know about the distance. It's hard to make the online or video to offer the distance. Because when the students are in online or when they try to make video they are not going to take care them self. For example: I remember when I was six grade my friend PROPER_NAME was making online video. We went to classes from home to know how far it is. On that time she just focus on her video she wasn't focus on her way. After that, she try to cross the way but she still making video. She didn't saw the car she try to cross the road. So,she got some accident because of the video and she just focusing what she is doing.

The most important way is to offer the distance classes from home is using map. It's easy to know how far or how close it is. Other ways, the students have to take care there self when they are in the way because there is a lot of car.

Additional, there are not going to take care them self when they are making online or video. They just focus what there are doing. For example: when I was tine grade I remember my friend PROPER_NAME she was eleven grade.

She try to offer the distance for her friend by making video. When She was school from home. Then, she started showing the way. On that time, she wasn't take care her self because she was focusing the video.

Next, she try to cross the way by raining. She didn't pay attention the way and she got car accident. On that time she passed away she died. I agree some students think they would benefits from being able to attend classes from home. But most of them are not going to take care them self because there are not focusing the way. They just focusing what there are doing or they just focusing online or video. Additional, using map is butter than making online or video. Other ways its hard to make online or video for offer the distance. Most students are not going to focus when there are making that.

4ABC0ED00F91,"Do you believe that in order to success is going though failure contently? People think that going though failure can help you be successful though out time. Some example could be emotions, not giving up, and a quote ""Third time is the charm."" These are some of the things that people do in order to succeed though failure.

First, when people can not got something right the first time they can get emotional such as upset, mad, and frustrated and many more. An example of this could be when you are working on a math problem and you did not get the right answer the first time people can get upset. That is why emotions can be a part of failing to get successful.

Moreover, when people can not get something done they tend to just give up and do nothing. People should never give up because not everyone gets it the fist time. One example can be when you are trying to find information about an animal and you can not find anything on it so you just give up and not do the research information and now you are going to get a zero for it which is not good. This is why you should never give up even if it is hard for you

Although, most people have heard this saying ""third times the charm."" This saying has a meaning to it because it is telling you that you have to keep on trying in order to get it right. Sometimes when you keep on trying it can turn out better then the other times that you tried. One example can be when are drawing something and you do not like it you can try again and do it better then the first time. Keep on trying in till you like it or in till you get it right.

I think that many people are avoiding going outside, because of cell phones. going outdoors is actually more fun than staying indoors doing nothing, because you can do a lot of activities. Some activities you can do is play sports, practice sports, run laps, and do exercise. I think that some people find outdoor activities enjoyable, because they can do activities with others and enjoy the weather while doing activities.

People should go outdoors more, because if they dont go outdoors and dont do activities, there is a chance that later on in life they can have weak bones. There are people who stay indoors just listening to music, but you can actually go outside and do activities while listening to music. If you dont like to play sports, exercise, or run laps you can just ride your bike. Riding your bike can actually help you later in life, because it can give you stronger bones and can improve your stamina and strength.

Another thing that you can do is play outdoor games, such as tag, freeze tag, and hide and go seek tag, but there is many more. These outdoor games can also improve your stamina and strength.

8E053EA4FE6F,"Should schools offer distance learning? I think yes because first of all the counties would be saving numerous amounts of money. One we wouldn't need to worry about buses no more, transportation it self is probably very expensive. We as students wouldn't have to get up so early no more we could chose what time we start learning. Also students wouldn't have to worry about disgusting school lunches the county would be saving more money, because students would be at home making their own food at the comfort of their own house. They also wouldn't have to worry about bad friends no more.

If schools were using video conferencing it would be so much easier for students to get ready for school. Students would just have to brush their teeth and then they would sign in to their video conference website and they would just call their teacher. Also their would be less distractions it would just be one on one, teacher and student no classmates distracting each other. It would be more easier for students to learn also because the teacher could focus on the student, then the student would focus on teacher and get all of their assignments done, students will learn better if its one on one. It would also be much safer with all these school shootings happening in today's society.

Another thing students wouldn't have to be stressing about food getting them sick no more. Because the school lunches are just nasty and terrible. Students will be more comfortable at their home eating their food instead of the counties food. Think about all the money we could save with the website they could make. No one has to spend no more lunch money, on cheap food that will make your stomach hurt for a week straight.

Also we could stop bullying by starting this program up. Students wouldn't be able to get picked on no more because it would be a one on one conversation. Parents would not have to worry about bad influences on their child because they're child would be safe at home not with bad people at school. They wouldn't be around any other kids unless they go outside. Students will be more ready for the real world if we start this program.

If we start this program the county will be saving thousands of dollars and we could be spending that money we need in the world. If we start it students could chose a time in their day to start learning for at least four hours they would log in and say hello to their teachers through a screen. They would have to wake up at six o'clock in the morning then brush their teeth, then go pick a outfit they would like to wear in school. Instead of all that stress they could just wake up brush their, then make breakfast and if they wanted to start class now they could. This a terrific idea if the county starts a program like that.

12F2FFF56A84,"I think that if my school extended our school hours by two more hours every day for four days, kids will have rough a time focusing and staying awake then a normal school schedule. These are my reasons why I think my school should not change its school schedule.

I'll list a couple of reasons why my school should not add an extra two hours to school. For one a lot of kids dont get enough sleep I read somewhere in a book that kids on average get about five to seven hours of sleep. If this is true then you already have a butch of students that deprive themselfs from sleeping on time. Another reason why my school shouldn't have a four day week ten hours a day schedule plan is its going to be extreamly difficult to focus for a straight ten hours in class for the student and teacher.

The advantages of having a school week of four days and ten hours in a school day will definitly save school resources. If the students and staff only had to come for four days instead of five days but extend two hours on school days it would probably be smart as a low cost energy saving plan standpoint , but because I dont think students or staff are going to be focused enough to be in a classroom for ten hours in a day.

If somehow the students can get eight to nine hours of sleep then the plan might work out but because teenagers stay up all night long and dont get enough sleep on average then it would probably just be a waste of time to plan this out.

Third reason a younger student pairing up with an older student is beneficial is because it makes the older student feel more responsible for somebody else is learning like making sure the younger student knows this like making sure he/she knows how to pronounce words correctly make sure the younger student can be organized.

Students can also work at their own pace at home in a relaxing enviroment which I think works best. Lastly, this would give students more free time for themselves and choose whatever they want to do what they can't do during the day.

Most students around the United States dislike waking up early in the morning and having to take the long proccess of getting ready and parents yelling at them ""Wake up"" or ""The bus is going to leave you"". There are some schools that offer online classes that benefit students from going to school and taking the classes online. I think this would help all students from stress becasue you won't have to think about early morning wake ups. This would help students not having to deal with overloads of work stressing about ""where did I put my papers"" and losing valuable homework. This also helps with time management. Students won't have to go to school for more than 7 hours and be stuck in class sleep deprived and would just be at home taking there time with there classes online. Furthermore, this would help students getting into trouble at school and dealing with teachers about who's right and who's wrong.

In addition, students would benefit even more becasue they would work at there own pace. Students can take time by working in each subject at there pace and won't be rushed by and teachers or anybody. I think this is a great way for students to build self-indepence for the real world becasue they will be on there own and have to manage there time wisely and accordingly. I also think you can get more worked down where the you can choose a place at home or a nearby coffee shop where students don't have distractions. Students can also engage with other students if they taking the same materials and help each other out.

Moreover, this allows students to have more free time and social time to themselves. Many students these days want to have some change in there pockets and find partime jobs. This would allow students to either choose a job or a hobby they like to pursue during the day since they won't be physically at school. Most students can join a sport they like and also have plenty if time to condition and practice to get better.

In conclusion,

students would benefit from being able to atttend classes from home. I would reccomend many schools should have online classes for students who just dont feel school isnt where they can learn but at home they can enjoy there comfort and still excel. ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,8.0

I can fix people if they have any medical problems in life. I was reading books about doctors and I started to get interested becoming one. Being a doctor is alot of hard work, I love doing hard work because hard work makes you pay off. My parents told me don't do something what you think it's fun, do something what you love, what I want to do and love to do in life is to become a doctor.

I sometimes mainly do hard work because of money, one of my main goals is to get alot of money. I need money to buy a house, have children, and taking care of my family. Doctors get alot of money when they do hard work, it's not easy to become one. Hard work makes you feel tired, but at the same time you relax and get alot of money. Money is not important in life, when you have alot of money, the first thing I think about is family first, then I think anything I want on the second thought.

I would mostly become a surgeon than a doctor because I read mostly about surgeries and it get me even more interested. Surgery is not that disgusting when you get used to it, that's why I read alot of surgeon books. When I first thought of surgery, I thought it was really disgusting, but then my uncle told me alot about it, then I stopped the disgusting part. My favorite part about surgery is fixing people, I feel happy that i'm fixing the person. The main reason why I want to become a surgeon is because I want to get alot of money to take care of my family, and I want to help people in life.                  ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0
DCDED7261D03,"""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it"" everyone should be free of deciding their own character this is important because it can help with being more confident about yourself while making difficult choices, making clear what your goals for the future are, and makes easier to show who you really are to other individuals . In the other way some people believe that our character is formed by the difficulties and influences beyond our control.

First, feeling confident about yourself is one of the best ways to succeed in life, it makes easier when deciding difficult choices, sometimes when people go through difficult moments in their lives, being confident with their self can help them choosing the best decision by just looking at the positive way of their decisions. For example, every time people visit a new locations they should feel confident with their selves while creating new friendships or business.

Secondly, setting your goals is not as easy as it sounds, because you have to know what you really want, when people know what their goals are they have to work really hard and encourage their selves to achieve it. If people chose their own character its easier to set their goals because they really know who they are. For example, one of my goals is to graduate from high school. So,I need to put a lot of effort and hard working to achieve it.

In the other way, some people claim that our character if formed by the influences beyond our control, some of those difficulties might be what your parents want or economic resources. Also, when people let others create their life choices or character they don't enjoy their life as how they want to enjoy it. Foe example, if your you let your parents decide what to do with your future, you might don't like that decision and that would not be really who you are.

In addition, making your own character influence in how you show others who you truly are, this is important because, it feels better doing something that you chose and want than doing something that other individuals what you to do or difficult situations.

In conclusion, I am agree with ""John's"" quote because everyone should be able do decide what that really want to become, feeling confident with their selves, having clear all their goals and work hard to achieve them all, your character shouldn't be former by influences beyond their control. You should be able to show everyone who you really are.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,8.0

My first reason why is becouse when I was wrieing my last essay for english i didnt now how to write it, but the more i fael on my essay the better I will get at them, the more I will grow and I would have mastered a new skill. I like to stick with the stuff I already know, i know a little bit of stuff and that dosent maek u smart if u dont try somthing beyond what you have mastered, you will never grow.

There are peple that have everything good with them and they dont puch them selvis to grow in life to be someone its becoues they are lazy they jusy dont want to be someone they just dont care if they grow, succed or be someone in life.

My forth resaon why I agree with Emerson's statement. is on why i thinck 16 or 17 year olds should have jobs becouse it will theach you how to work how to deal with the money you get and were you should spend that money it will help them when they grow up and it will show you how it will feels when you grow up it will make you succed in life it mite be hared but you will grow.

8EB2AF12FA77,"To being with, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of then hours. Schools are planing to do two hours of school each week. The disadvantages of doing such a thing to school are, Schools are reducing school hours, teachers won't be getting a salary instead they will get pay hourly, and the economic is going to be low.

I believe that, school days shouldn't be reduce ,just because they want to save energy. Students must be at school for eight hours. Otherwise the teachers won't have the time to give the given material. Students studies will get interrupted if they get two hours of school weekly.

Second reason, is that teachers won't be getting a salary for two hours of work. The pay checks will be reduce to hours worked during the week just like any other job that pays by hour. That means that those people need a secondary job so they can support themselves

Finally, the economic will increase because businesses are reducing peoples hours just because they want to save up energy. People have debts to pay like credit cards, health/car insurance etc. Food cost will highly increase its price.

In conclusion, employers shouldn't reduce peoples hours. it is a good idea to reduce the energy that we consume but in away it's also affecting our economic and learning system.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,6.0
615FAEE4F8EF,"School should not extend the school days more than eight hours. Some people think that spending more time at school would be a good idea because students would have more time to study. Others think that An 8 hours of school time is enough time to study every day. This is an controversial issue and school time should not be too much .This change would affect students and teachers because some students have part time jobs,students would not have enough time to do their daily activities with friends and family,teachers and students would be tired by the the end of the day and they would not do good.

Some students have part time jobs and they take some rest before going to work after school. Some students go to work right away after every school to get out early and do their homework after. By adding two hours a to the school schedule would make students who have job work till late. Even though some students need to work as much time as they can to help their families or pay something they are trying to buy. Some of this students would be also constantly tired of spending too much time at school and then going to work.

Another reason why school days should only be eight hours long and not ten is because students would not have enough time to do their daily activities. Students hang out with family and friends. Some students are part of a sport team and they have to have time to go practice. Even some students help their family to either clean or any other thing that has to be done at home. Some students have to take care of their little siblings after school because their parent have to go shopping or work. Students also need to do what they like and by doing that they would be more active.

Another reason is that teachers and students would be tired by the the end of a ten hours school day and they would not do good. Some students are already tired in the 4th hour of school. Some students do not want to do their work in the last class and some fall sleep even in a eight hours school day. Even teachers would get tired of being teaching and grading papers all day long. When it comes to a history teacher they have to talk a lot in every class and they get tired. By making every school day 10 hours long would put to much pressure to students and teachers that they would be exhausted by the end of the day that they would not be able to pay attention in their work.

School itself it hard sometimes but working and studding is even worst and those who work and study at the same time often need time time to get things done, and by spending too much time in just one thing can affect the other .Every one has personal things and activities to do and some require certain among of time.

46A763F7D942,"Everybody has to do a hard work to accomplish their achievements as job or studying for school, instead we need breaks in a determinate time of our lives for accomplish our goals. I am strongly agree that schools follow a model by extending the school day two hour would be a great idea because this change can provide us a better lifestyle. In the other hand, does not have any sense if we do everything wrong for cause of lack free time for our needs, as well as to have stress, to get decayed grades and do not have time for people who we love. Also, I will provide a disadvantage for this change by extending the school day.

First, extending school day is a excellent idea because a lot of people can avoid suffer stress during the school day. Also, sickness is an issue that can affect us mentally as well as healthily. For example, when I was in my country my school had an overstate schedule, and many of my classmates get sick for excess of homework and tests. Most of them get depressed and children suffer healthy problems as well as loss weight for the same issue. Therefore, some of them unfortunately give up since they get pretty depressed, since they had a lot of business to accomplish also, some of them had to maintain a scholarship. To do all of this stuff was a real challenge.

Meanwhile, if student are allowed to have more free time, we will have better academic achievements. For example, I was student at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico and I have to be at school a lot of time even after school because sometimes I had to go some counseling. Likewise, many times I had to do a lot of stuff and at the end of the semester I usually forget everything. Also one time I lost my scholarship. For this reason I believe that to have extra free day is a great resource for a lot students as me, because when I arrive in this country I have a little more free time than Mexico. In addition, I realized that to have extra time work for to be a success person, my grades go up the last year, even I was in honor roll the whole year.

Thus, a lot of us have a family and we have to spend time with our parents since family is a important factor of people's lives. We should be thankful with our parents because their are always willing to to anything for us. That is why we need more time for them. For example, a lot of times I want to play or to be with my father or my siblings, nevertheless a have to do homework or study for any test. Likewise, this year is a challenge for me because I have to take five SOL's test, my admission test in November in my country and y senior project; even though I have been in this country just one year. For this reason I would like to have a free extra day for to be with my parents,siblings, and do all my stuffs. My family is everything to me.

In the other hand, I believed that to have two extra hours each day during school,

it will result the same thing to come at school five time for week. For example, if I go at school six hours everyday for five days the result will be thirty hours in total. However,

if I join two more hours each day except Fridays because that day I supposed to get free day, I would get thirty-two hours in total. Nevertheless, I believed that is a fair to have more hours of school because as reward I will have four free days and no just three. Moreover, I will have more time to be relax, and I will get better notes at school. In addition, in my opinion

I would prefer to suffer a little at school,

and then repose also, I will hep me to be relax and spend time with my family.

Finally, my school should follow this model by extending the school day because is helpful for everyone, even for adults. Therefore,

breaks are great in multiples senses as well as everybody are merit to have free time for our parents who had been a huge support for us. Also, we merit free time for doing any activity to avoid stress and be healthy. We need free time for get academics achievements as well as get a great notes and then we could get a scholarship for college. All of this points will work for to gave us energy and sources to have a better life style. To have more extra hours in less day during a weeks is better than to do everything with stress. As my final reflection, we are humans no robots, we needs breaks, and we have needs to serve as family for example, and in the future will see how we improve in our lives.

BDF0709671AC,"In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school.

Not only that but also being commit to a specific career at a young age . This issue with young students and their study to a specific career isn't a good idea, nor is it fair. There are many reason why this topic isn't fair.

For example,

it's not fair to have a young student make a specific dissension on career when there so much more they can pick instead of setting there mind to on specific topic,

they may not have interested in when there so many other opportunity they can pick from.

Being commit to one specific career isn't at all easy, when you know there so many other opportunity out there you will like and want. But because you enjoy it, when your young you really have no clue what career will best suit you.

After you choose what career then comes the commitment to the class and other subject.

Another reason this is a bad idea is because not only do theses young student have to pick a career at young age.

They also have to keep in mind that their class will be about and how this will guide them toward their career. Another thing is that these young minds will be overwhelmed about all the work they will be having to do during their classes.

Another problem would be the about of stress they will be put in, also the amount of homework they will be giving and the amount of time they will have to get it done, it will be a big stress for the young students.

Further more, young student will have a difficult time with weather or not they make the right call on what career they picked. Having to make a big dissension on what career best suit you isn't at all easy it make over think your choose and how hard it will be so on.

Then after you will start to question weather or not you really want to pick that on career or will there be more along the way that best are in your interest and you will know when you find that one career that really chases your eye later on when you know what path to take.

In conclusion being commit to a career at a young age isn't a great idea, after putting all this though in this dissension it's best to say that it a bad dissension in the matter. For these reason not only do you have to be think about how hard it to pick a good career but also think of the career and the path you will be taking, not only that but also seeing if this career suit you in the best way, also see the outcome of it all. This will always be a big affect in life because your debating weather or not to follow the path or giving up and not trying because the path you choose wasn't the right choices. In other word i feel that it would be a bad idea to commit to a career at a young age not knowing what will be the big out come of it all. ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,6.0
AE96820CDAA2,"Can we get more activities done by working on it all the time? working on a goal, it takes us time. I know that achieving a goal it is one of the proudest activities we can make for ourselves. But thinking and working about a goal everyday it is not the best idea. Because we do not have time for ourselves, also we need to recharge our minds in order to continue doing an activity, and stress will come to our lives.

Firstly, to become successful in this world, we need a routine based on productive things and also time for ourselves to do what we desire. We need time for ourselves to relax an enjoy what this world offers us. 5 years ago I remember when my parents were too busy to have a day off and to take care of me during the school year. My dad was working in a construction company from Monday through Saturday, and my mom was studying at the university. We did not have time for ourselves to have a deep conversation and enjoy a day off at home. We needed a break time during that moment, but once the Spring Break came, we stopped our routine. My parents and I were happy because we knew that we have time to make some fun things, and we stopped worrying about school, work and study. After the break we were ready and exhausted to start our routine again. Having a break between activities help us to give time to restart our minds.

Secondly, Humans are able to accomplish great goals, but time is required. When I was in middle school, my teacher always gave us time to relax and stop what we were doing at the classroom. According to my teacher, inactivity provides us energy and it is a way to going to be able to continue classwork or activities at school.

Practicing this activity was helpful to me, because I could concentrate even more on my activities at school. Additionally, when my classmates were tired, they ask the teacher for a break because they need that time to clear their minds from worries and stress.

My friends and I needed a time where we can interact with others. When I get to know with a new person it makes me feel important to that person. We need time not for only activities and responsibilities, we also need time to rest and stop worrying about work in order to recharge our minds and become successful.

Finally, stress can lead you to depression. It is hard to imagine how hard life can be. By concentrating even more on your required activities than fun activities, here it comes its negative side. Some people might quit their goals by not having time for themselves. For example; when my big brother went to college, he needed money to pay college and utensils. He was required to work at a restaurant to earn some money. Once he started going to college and working at the restaurant. I noticed that he was super exhausted, stressed and quiet. He felt he was not able to finish college. After a couple of days he quit college and his job, because of not having time for himself he stopped trying to reach his goal. He could reach his goal but too much activity and stress led him to depression. Breaks are important as activities in our lives.

Many claim that the more early and rapidly you start doing your activities, the more chances you have to get things done. Additionally, some people believe that breaks are not important and beneficial on achieving a goal, and it should not be required to us; however, taking a break between your activities it is going to change your life. Because you have time to recharge your mind, also you have time for yourself, and stress does not affect your well-being. Life is short do not let activities lead you to depression take a break and start again.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,7.0
97C6E22BA8EE,"Working alone will always be a better progress to your knowledge. Some people think that is better to work in group than by yourself. But many famous people has shared their own stories of life and it show how working alone can open your brain to another level and acomplish more of what others think that just can be done in group. I read an old story of my favorite wrestler , and he explained how he worked really hard at the gym to become one of the best wrestler man in the whole story;that's why I think is better to work alone because working alone help to increase your understanding , it show that you are willing to grow on your own, and it will be one more step forward of your knowledgy.

Consider,for a moment, working alone will help to increase your understanding and if working alone have so many people on the top of hall of fame why we should not try to be one of those people , but to be one of those people we need to work harder than ever. However, people must work alone and they must feel the pain of the hard work that they need to get done. Furthermore,to increase your understanding you must try to learn or do something new every single day of your life, In order to see the result of the hard work that you are doing , does not matter if that is a meantal or physical work as long as you are doing a safe work to succed in those goals.

Besides, working by yourself is safer than working in group and when people work alone it show the desires to grow by their own experiences because a lot of times we trust people that we should not trust for many reason as envious of what you are cusseding at, pervert people in your group doing the wrong work that they should not do,and many times they do the wrong work just to see you down or because they are not interesting on the topic or kind of work than the group supposed to be doing. According with paragraph one ,working alone will definitely take you to succed in your goals and you will get each of your goals done. However, you must be focus and give all the motivation to those dreams that you have in life.

There is a lot of people that think is better to be working in group than by ourselves because five heads think better than a single one. True , I agrees that five heads think better than one , but how about not every menber in the group is agree with the topic or the material that they are working on; what could happen there is problems between themselves because none of them have the same goals or thoughts. Moreover, it could even cause discussiones with teachers, and it will be worse for the group, so which means working alone would be the best option for everyone to take. That way every person can work on their goals and express their diffrent thoughts without getting into discussions.

Concluding with paragraph one,two and three,'' working alone would be the best fit to you to acomplish everything you want as long as you work for it,''. That is why I always try to work alone in all ways because it help to discover new things , a new person inside of you, but also it help to push yoursel forward and always do your best in every single thing that you do on your own because at the end of the way whatever you acomplish,''that is gonna be your legacy,''. If it were up to me , working alone would definitelly be the first option to people to take in a classroom or any place that you are working on.             ",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0
07A4DAFDE5B7,"Hello, Mr: Principal.

I'm writing to you this letter to inform you about our responses about changing the school manu.

I'm a senior student in your high school. I really want to thank you about approving the idea of chenging the school manu to a new healthier and bigger one. We really appreciate that.

Some of us have a bad experince about the unhealthy food and the schol old manu.

one of them is PROPER_NAME he hate the spicy food and once before he tried it by mistake from the cafeteria, his stomach hurt him and he was throwing up all the day, and all of that because of the un healthy food.

And also I will tell you sir about my own experince, I still remember, when I was a kid I had one of the worst days on my entire life in the middle school when I decided to eat the new spicy wings with the super hot souce, I went to the hospital and I was very sick for a long time in the home.

And all of that because of the unhealthy food such as what our school used to have.

Do you know sir, I used to feel unacceptable in the school, just because the food, just because I can not eat like the rest of the students. and I can not enjoy the food with them.

I have never tried the school food since that day. the only case I could eat the school food is when the cafeteria have some kinds of soap, and some kind of the none spaicy food. And there is a lot of students have the same case of me, we all are sharing our healthy lunch together, you might before have seen us in the cafeteria while we are setting as a circle.

But by your decision, there are more than a hundred of student will turn back to eat in the school cafeteria.

We all will be enjoying the new cafeteria manu.

Especially because I heard that will be a different types of milk and different type chicken and also I heard from the new chef that you brought him from one of the biggest holtes in Virginia, he told me we will have a few types of salmon fish and others fish types.

In my opinion changing the school cafeteria manu was great idea to begin to keep your student health safe, especially your freshman and salphamore students.

I know what i'm telling you about the salphamore and the freshmens student very well, because I have my youngest brother his name is Generic_Name, he is addicted to the unhealthy food with the all of this food types, like the fast food. he could eat only the fast food in his life and he would be happy, but his body would not like that. Acctually his body begun to hurt him from now, because he been so fat and he could not move or do ant effort. he eats only the fast food which is the only unhealthy food in the world. he has a problems in his body, his body hurt him because he does not eat a vegetables and he does not has ant vetimans in his body, his body is fery big but is's very weak.and that is what the un healthy food does in our boodies. that is what you sir, saved us from and saved the next students from it. absotutly the healthy food a lot cheper than the unhealthy food. also one of the good thing is the teacher also would like to eat and try the new healthy food.

one of the good thing and actually it's the best thing ever is that healthy food will give the student more power than the un healthy food, and also the healthy food will make them paying more attention to the classes and to what the teachers are saying.

the new healthy food will be very good thing. I wish if you sir would took this decision 3 years ago, just whaen I was a freshman or when I was a salphamore that would be great if that happend. I can not stop Imagine if that happen I was going to be playing Gym all the summer and in the winter I'm was going to have PE class. That was going to be very good. I wish if that happend before.

But htat's fine I still can enjoy the rest of this year with eating a just healthy food from our cafeteria from this new chef. I heard he will add a new typers of food from other countries like France and Egypt and Spain, and Ethiopia also. yeah that is how the school lunch should be like.

Do you know Mr: principle that there are about 20 Muslim student in this school who does not eat the old manu food like the bacon and Pig.

Do you know Mr: Principal, in our school there are about 50 student or more than that who are vegan, this students used to feel very bad about the old school manu because they could ot eat any food from the cafeteria for all the time they had in the school. But from now and over these students are very happy about your decision. and also the Muslims students now they are happy because they can eat the vegan food and a least they can eat the chicken and the others food.

Actually I know there are a lot of student will arguement with you about your decision. but they still young to understand that, they still too young to look for thier health and the healthy food and the unhealthy food.

But, acctualy they will appreciate that very well when they became adults.

828AD5868299,"Is setting a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people, or are there better ways to influence others? I think showing that your personality is good and outgoing can influence the people your always around with. One other reason is if you show how hard you work and how much you bring to your community, it can influence others to do the same thing.

If your behavior is good and outgoing it can influence the people you hang out with. An example is, if you hang out with your friend with a very admirable behavior it can effect the way you act in a positive way. Another example is, when everyone see's what kind of a person you are and how you help others for anything they need help with it can effect their mood in many positive ways which could help them in the future to do good deeds.

If you show how hard you work and how much you do for your community it can influence others positively. If you are helping the community by doing fundraisers or helping from preventing littering in the area it impacts the the community in a good way and it influences others to do the same thing. Another example is, if you show how hard you work in something it can show what kind of a person you are and help influence the people that are always around you to succeed in whatever their goal is for the future.

Some people may think that your behavior doesnt matter on how it influences others because they think there are a lot more methods to influence others without showing your personality. I think the opposite because your behavior can effect others because of the set of mood and the way your acting. Your personality is a big factor to influence other in a positive way.

In conclusion i think the reader should search up on how a humans behavior can set a good example for many people and show what come from it in the future.             ",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,8.0
8C34447FF21C,"I have heard that many people gets bully by others people sometimes, and which is I don't understand, why this it happens probably for the color of you're skin and we all are the same just the color of the skin is different. Or can be other reason why they bully other people, which is people who gets bully they could kill themselves about getting bullied by other ones and thats a bad situation.

But those bad people they keep on bulling they don't stop until something happens and I ask my self why? this happens sometimes, probably its because we are different than they are or they feel more stronger than other ones or can be any other reason probably they are rich they have more money than other people, probably thats why bulling someone is not nice it could cause bad things to you.

And I understand that its hard for those people who are suffering about bulling, and its hard to support all that when you get bullied for someone, when you bullied i thin k is not for some reason and its horrible for those people who gets bullied by someone, I think thats something that those people who are bulling they should stop bulling those poor people.

What should we do about bulling collaborate to stop we should stop because, it can cause bad situation to those people who are bulling other they can go to jail for the reason they make fun of others, why they can go jail because those poor people who are getting bullied they could kill themselves and thats why they can go to jail its a bad thing thats what can happen to them if they don't stop bulling           ",2.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,4.0
65CC82C9B3C9,"I I agree because people should have more time to rest mostly because the effect of the stress and the health of their body. Schools should be the same, they could have more time to do their homework and rest, because there is stress in children. In the majority of middle schoolers and high schoolers there is always stress and preoccupations about grades. Most of high school teenagers stress and worry about colleges if they got in or not. And by taking the four-day weekend we are reserving energy and resources, by not driving cars or motorcycles because of the toxic smoke a vehicle throws to the air we breath.

Sometimes some of the big businesses become of abusive or people's hours to get extra work done. It should be people's decision if they want to stay extra hours if they want to get their work done. People work to live and not live to work they somehow got to look for ways to provide themselves and sometimes their families. If they were to finish their jobs with everything done , they get to go home and be with their families.

Having the time off can be people to catch with work if they are behind or for teenagers to catch up with homeworks. School sometimes can be exhausting because some people could be depressed or stressed out to get their things done. Everyone can run out of energy especially when everybody expects for you to do good. Every single member of your family is always telling you to do good just to get things in life is very stressful. Working hard through four days it is more then enough to get work done if you put your mind to it.

People need the extra time to relax, because it is not good for the body mentally and physically. Working too much causes stress and grueling because thinking too much about work and worrying about the bills that they have to pay. By being worried too much can even cause you to go to the hospital so it would be not be good for your health. When you think about the things you have to do to support yourself you have to put yourmind to it and not slack if you want that advantage of thedays you are going to have work.

In conclusions I agree because people should have more time to relax and not stressed about their jobs and what they have to do. People get exhausted and start to worry about all of their responsabilities they have to do. Working for 10 hours is more then enough for a person. Sometimes teeagers and adults carry many preoccupations that they shouldn't worry about but they have to if it envolves them. Schools should be the same and not be so stressful, it could be dangerous to stress and not sleep because they worry about the responsabilities that have to be done.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,8.0
21460A7F2719,"Although some people might think that graduating in 3 years in stand if traditional four years is bad and doesnt worth it, I disagree with them, because graduating from high school early can help you with a lot of thinks.

First, reason I wanna talk about is getting a job which in my opinion I think is really important for high school students, for example it can help you save up money for your dream college that you wanna go too or save money for your dream job, and also getting to know new people and learning how things work in real life; how people react with each other.

The second reason I wanna talk about is having more time to think about what colleges you wanna go, and what your college plans are, and having more time to focus on your summer/evenings courses.

Last but not least I feel like some students don't have time to spend with their families because their always busy doing things and, working, I just feel that can help them get more time with their loved ones.

45E5B6DE09E9,"One of the most frequently debated questions in today's society is whether or not first impression are possible to change. Many people argue that first impression are almost impossible to change. They say that is not possible and inevitable. I disagree with the statement. I believe that first impressions can be can be changed because we cannot judge people just by looking at them, everyone has different viewpoints, and we dont know the struggles that the other people are going through. Words can also hurt!

The first reason as to why i disagree with the statement is because we cannot judge people from first impressions. The way people act or interact is not essential information to see the intellectual development and capacity of those individuals who are being judge. There is a famous quote that says, ""Our words can sometimes hurt even more than a punch."" We all can relate to this, sometimes the words that other people use to express are very damaging and hard to listen; even when is just a silly joke that one of your friends is saying.

Nevertheless, everyone has different perspectives and view points, but just because we may think differently, doesn't mean we have to get driven by our perceptions or speculations. There are millions of people in this planet, and every single one of us think and look different. We are all not the same. The complementary diversity we have nowadays is a great example of this. It is good to have a great range of diversity, but the race we all come from cannot define us, nor the judgments that other people make from us.

The last and final reason is that we don't know the struggles that the other person is going through. Sometimes, we may look tired, weary, or even depressed. Sometimes we are having problems with our families or with our own selves. The judgments we make can potentially affect those individuals life. Sometime we make decisions without thinking about consequences or how those decisions are going to impact others. Decisions, such as the judgments from different speculations we make.

As you have read, I disagree with the statement. I believe that the judgment from our first impressions is not inevitable. We are capable to change our own perception from other people that can potentially affect their lives throughout the struggles that he or she may be facing.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,9.0
22BF4720FB84,"for this issue, I think attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would not benefit. Students would not benefit to attend classes from home because not just for studying in books but we go to school for another reason also, for examples we go to school for getting friends and that mean we have social. And another is we can do activities that we get from some classes.

First, friends form school is the reason that students cloud go to school because they will get a good relationship and that mean they have a socialite. If students attend classes from home they might get just a thing that teacher teach them but they will not get a teamwork when they have any work group form teacher. They will not know how to be a teamwork or working with another people. When they graduate for high and get into college or apply a job and they never used to have a social it will not work for them because they do not know about teamwork or how to live whit a group of people.

Second ,it is about activities for student. When they study,some subject they have to go outside from school for studying ;sure as scenes classes would go to a sea for studying about a sea,so if they go and see a real sea, students might get information more than they get from a book and can feel it. Students should do activities and study in books together it might help students understand.

I think,student should go to school because I believe that we can do better when we do thing that not just read books or study at home but we should go to school fore getting better.         ",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0

BD889A4D831B,"Students have to attend school to learn more efficiently, but long distance learning is not good because you have to take your own notes online ,however, if you were to attend school on regular time, you would not have to worry about taking your own notes. Although, online is still a option because you just need a computer or a laptop to take online classes, and not having to worry about missing the class when the teacher took notes that day. All you have to do for online school or video conferencing is get online and do all your classes, and not worry about getting to school. Students need to go to school instead of online or video conferences to learn more and participate in class or school.

Going to school than taking online classes or video conference is way better because you go to school and actually pay attention and not get distracted of what is around you in school ,however, taking online classes can get you easily distracted when you're at home or a public place trying to do you work and you hear people talking and having conversations all around you. While you're in school you can peacefully finish all your work in class and ask for a question, or even help from the teacher, but if you're taking online classes your only source is most likely going to be a online source, or the guides they give you online which might not be always correct. The information online could be outdated. while the information at school is planned out and ready to be given out by the teacher or staff at school. Even though, everyone would prefer online classes over actually going to school, people should consider going to school for a backup just in case the people taking online classes don't like how it is done. Going to school and learning just for being in class helps you in a lot of ways such as visually, speaking, and self control, however, if you're at home taking online classes it will only help on your visual learning.

Taking online classes can probably be difficult sometimes, because people can forget to take the class the day you need to log in ,however, going to school and knowing which days to go to school is very helpful because you can learn without any problems happening. Although taking classes online and not having to go anywhere and stay where you are is good, you're putting your grades at risk, the computer can malfunction or even be corrupted with a virus on it, and it can slow down your computer or even shut it off every time you need to do your work. This is why going to school is more efficient. The people that go to school have no worries just bring all the materials they need for class and work and pay attention.

3E47DA330201,"Allow students to graduate in three year, its a good idea, for the most part. Students can take the necessary courses during the summer or after school; when students follow this plan, most of them are not able to take elective clases. If students want to enter college or work force one year early this would benefit them, but in the other part their high school education wouln't be enough. Graduating from high school in three years has its good and bad sides.

Planning to graduate in three years has it good benefits for students, such as: enter college one year early, students can work and save for college, take this year as a break and then enter college, and if they want to enter work force one year early, this benefits them, too. For example, sometimes, students work and go to school and feel tired of having this responsabilities at the same time. Following the plan of graduating in three years, would be very beneficial for them. They can take one year break from school and only work, so they can feel less stressed at the moment of entering college. Doing these can clear more their thoungs and also decide on what they want to do for their future.

However, taking all the courses they need in three years, can bring a lot stress to them and if they work would be a lot to do. One year break can help them, but the stress caused before that can affect them. Also, not taking elective classes in some way can affect their education, what if they take a major that need classes they did not take during these three years. Students might have to pay or work more in college so they can achieve their goals.

According to the ideas, reasons, or examples that were given, I support the idea that students graduate from high school in three years. Even if these cause them stress, one year break can be a big help for their life and their way on deciding what they want for the future. As a student, having the oppornunity I will take it, work on what need, and put a lot effort to achieve my goal. We know that to achieve our drams or goals we make sacrificies in our lifes, give our all, work hard, and never give up. Work hard three years, have a break, a go back to our goal it's a good way to plan make in our lifes. ",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,8.0

I was in walmart one day, than I saw a man with small legs and Generic_Name started make fun of how the man walked, talked, and the man heard him he asked Generic_Name if he wanted to do a biking raise with him, Generic_Name said yes, they did the raise and the man with small legs own. After that Generic_Name never made fun of anyone he saw. A problem is a chance for you to do your best because it can change your life and it can teach you.

First of all, a problem can change your life. Oneday

I was at walmert and Generic_Name was telling his story of the past. He said, I used to steal, tell lies, I didn't listen to anyone and I also didn't work. One day, we went on a family vacation, on our way back we got hit by a truck and

I was the only one who surived in that accident. After that, I wanted to take my life, for I didn't see the reason of living anymore. Six months passed, and nothing was working in my life. Then oneday I went to the beach planing to take my own life he said, when I started walking toward the water I saw a man sitting in the sand. He asked me, who are , my name is Generic_Name

I said, and I started telling the man my story. Then the man said, your life matters the reason why you survived the accident that night is because it wasn't your time yet, your life matters because you are still breathing said the man, that is a gift because there are people out there wishing they don't have machines helping them to breath. These words changed my life, he said, I didn't forget about my family but I fixed my life for the good. This evidence shows that Generic_Name used to steal, tell lies, didn't work and didn't listen to anyone, his family got into a care accident and he was the only one that surived, he wanted to take his own life but all that changed when he met a man at the beach who opened his eyes. clearly, a problem is something that can take your life to the next level.

In addition, a problem can teach you. There was this man named Generic_Name, he was a faithful man he helped people in need with what he had, Generic_Name had eleven children, five boys and six girls. All his children were trained to help people in need. One day, something happened, a messanger came to Generic_Name and told him that his house was set one fire, and his children were in there. Everything that Generic_Name owned was destroyed, Generic_Name, who was Generic_Name's wife, was not pleased with what happened. Generic_Name's friends told him to repent maybe he did something bad to his God, but he said he didn't sin against anyone, his wife told him to curse God and he will die , but Generic_Name didn't. Oneday Generic_Name got really mad that he shouted at God and when he did that he remembered years ago, Generic_Name promised to give a family some food and kept saying I will give you some food I promised, but Generic_Name will always forget. The whole family died because of Generic_Name. When he remembered this Generic_Name asked forgiveness to God, and he forgave Generic_Name. Everything he had was restored. This evidence shows that Generic_Name lost everything he had, but at last he remmbered his mistake and asked for forgiveness. Clearly, we can learn from our problems. Inconclusion, a problem can be a chance for you to do your best because it can change your life and it can teacher to you.

You need to show to everyone what are your ambition to improve your life, and if you don't show to the World what you can affort, do not put any complain to someone else for your fault. You always want to know what are your own limits.

First, I think what he is trying to said with "" Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is always have big dreams bigger than you and have big ambition too. That you always work hard and know your position and show to everyone how you get there, because is not easy go to the top and keep the place, and most of the people give up, and not showing us their goals complete.

Second, do not put any complain to someone else for your fault, ehat you did, you did thinking what its the best way for you, and don't take it like a loss, take it like you get more experience in life, and its not always happines have sadness too, but always you are getting more knowledge to know how to do that next time, and show to the world how you get there.

Third, people always have challenging on their life that cause that people always want to know what are their limits, so they always push themselves to know what are their limits until they can't anymore. Then, they try to overpass their limits working harderst than anyone, sacrificing themselves, and living their pride to stay at the top or to go at the top.

In my opinion, everyone have the right to improve their life that only they need its to be more confidence then its to do not to give up and push themselves in other words being perseverance to overpass their limits thinking always in big, and leave a legacy for the next generation.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0
28494A144B1A,"Character traits are what define a person. there are what make one person different the another. Although some people believe we choose our own character, nevertheless, our character are influences beyond our control because technology influences our traits and famous people can influences our traits and our parents influences our traits by they expectations.

To begin, video game can influenced our traits. For example, my own experience say

3 year ago I start play video game, when I star play with my friends. We always say that when we grow up we like to do what they are doing because their life look good. Also, we start doing the same things as the game like dancing, and thinking same as the game, and acting like them. Our others friends who do not play the game they tell us, that we are change our traits because we are acting like them too. One day we released that game was influenced our character. Clearly, because we star thinking in the future our life same as the game, and that we can do our future as we see in the game easily.

Furthermore, famous people influenced our traits. To continue with my experiences in things that I was influence, for example, when I was 12 year old. one day I was on YouTube, and I star see some videos about bloggers beauty, where they have a lot of makeup I do not use any makeup at the age, but when I see that they do their makeup, and look so beautiful I start doing my makeup, and think because I

was wearing makeup I look good, one they my mom ask me, why I am wear makeup, if I told her that I do not like makeup, I just say because they do their makeup. Then, now that I am 19 year old, I released that I was doing things that I do not like because they are doing. clearly, this prove me that I was influences for a famous beauty.

Finally, our parents influences our traits by they expectations. I will say something our parents want we do what they want. For example, we want to go out we are friends, and we ask our parents if we can go they say not, because they thing that our friend is a bad person. Also, they want to change our thought saying that bad thing about our friends, and finally they change are though about our friends. This show that, our parents can change our expectations about our friends. Clearly, parents always want we do what they want, and we always want they want because we do not them mad with us.

To concluded, our character are influenced beyond our control because video game can influences are traits and famous people can influences our traits, and our parents influences our traits by they expectations. technology influenced our character in form that we that life be like them and people can influence our change in the form the we do thing only, because we see they are doing then older people want to change our though to what they thing. To conclude, our character traits can be influences in different ways that we never expect that can happen. ",3.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,6.0

Not all people can think it can be true because you can do something wrong and get in trouble for it. You can keep doing the same problem and not care for it.

You can choose what your problem's are. You don't need to have a problem to do your best. You can be good at something and not have a problem with it. Some problems are good because you learn from what's good and bad. If you do something that's wrong it's ok. Because doing the right thing can be hard for people to do. Much of the time theirs something you can't do about it.

People choose to take the wrong path for their life and some don't. The ones who take the wrong path will go though a lot trouble. They would have a lot of problem's that they can't change but just cause you that path doesn't mean you change it. Even the ones who are living good doesn't mean their not going though some problems because everyone does.

So what I think it's trying to tell us is would you work out your problems to become the best. You can change one problem that's is stopping you from doing something. That you can change the wrong thing to a good thing. Even if you mest up doesn't mean you are bad. Learn from the problem you did and grow up as you learn form it.

5F8A5963A0E3,"The positive attitude is the key to success in life. I am disagree with this saying. The attitude is people hopeful to future. If want success, you needs effort and some luck, only positive attitude can not be a part of the success. The success of each person are never stop to learning to change. They are learning to effort more than mostly people and have a some opportunity. For example, A person help other person, than to be a boss, have a business. Second, a person was attitude and work in the restaurant, end of life, he did't success. Third, A person also a attitude person, he has money and a luck, but when end, also did't success.

First, I have see a news, the chartepeter is two person, I will call A and B. B does have A job, and one day, the A is sick, than, faint on the lord, B saw he is faint, sent him to treatment to fast. When A is weak up, he thanks B and let B come to him business to work, than, B effort to working everyday, finially, B was made a business, he to be a boss. Him not an attutude person, but he have a good luck. This thing of kind are much, maybe on the news is fake, but it is really to existence in the life.

Secondly, it's about attitude person. A person is work in the restaurant, this is a tired job, but this person is happy everyday, he was hopeful to new day, when he old and before the retirement, he also work in the restaurant, never change the jobs. This also are life of many people.

Third. this example is like to first example, but the end is diffident. A is attitude person and he help to B, B thank for him and give to him lot money. when A get money, buying lot thing to making happy. money is fast to less, when he have no money, he also are happy, because him think people live in the world, just happy for each day. I believe this thing also existence in the life.

AC5CB628970E,"Have you ever lied to someone with a good reason? Did you lie to someone to get you out of trouble? Everybody has lied before starting at a young age. Some people say that being honest is the best policy. Other people say that its okay to lie when you need to. I disagree with being honest at all time is because the surprise will ruin the fun, being safe from threats, and truth will hurt reputation.

First, A surprise will ruin anyone's fun. Nobody likes when anything exciting gets spoil because you told the truth about a surprise. Surprises can make people happy or any positive moods. They could have a bad day or the worst birthday and if ask anything about what you are doing later, telling the truth would let them know that there a surprise later that day. This will also effect the people who is also throwing them a party as well. For example, if it's someone birthday and ask what you are doing later that day, and told them a surprise birthday party then they wouldn't exciting as planed. The others will be mad because you ruin a fun party.

Also, being safe by many threats is a good reason to lie to someone. We don't want anyone to ask us our private information. If any kidnappers ask you any questions about the information you suppose to keep than you would be more in danger. For example, telling someone your information if asked they would do anything with it. They could post it on the media or tell someone dangerous the private information. That dangerous person would go after you because he or she know where you live to rob or kidnap you.

Finally, truth will hurt your reputation. When telling someone the truth anybody could use that to their advantage. Friends would not want to talk to you anymore. Some people might be disgusted by you or hate you. As an example, you have a crush on someone in your class that you keep secret . Someone mean ask you what your secret and told them you have a crush on a someone in your class. The mean person would tell the person you like and that person would probably stay away from you.

In conclusion, The reason why I would disagree is because not to ruin a surprise, being safe from threats, and truth will hurt your reputation. I don't say that you should lie all the time, but what I'm saying is it is okay to lie in these certain situations. If you don't want to lie at all you can ignore these questions or tell them why you don't wanna give any information about something.

Student might change their mentality, also you can think more mature while you are in high school, in high school you can really decide what you really want for your future. Starting high school with a perspective of what you want to study could be good because yo can gain some experience, however from my point of view i really think that is a bad idea.

Is it a good idea that students that enter to high school are expected to know what career they want to study and receive classes just for that career?; In my opinion is not a good idea because: Student might change their mentality.

I am a student and from my point of view i change my mentality almost every day. One quick example could be when i am in the cafeteria is really hard to chose what i want to eat because when i am in the classroom i said that i am going to eat something like a burger, but when i am in the cafeteria i decide to eat pizza. As a student i also change my mentality of what i want to work for the rest of my life because right now i work a part time after school as a bust boy, but i know that i don't want to work as a bust boy the rest of my life, so when i think of what i want to study that makes me crazy, however i'm in 11 grade and i feel the mature enough to chose what i want to be in my future, but as a student i feel afraid to chose the wrong career. That is one reason why i think that is a bad idea that students enter to high school and study only classes for one career.

Is it a good idea that students that enter to high school are expected to know what career they want to study and receive classes just for that career?; In my opinion is not a good idea because:

Students can think more mature while you are in high school than middle school.

In my point of view when we graduate from middle school we still think as a kid and while we are in high school we start developing what mature really means. In high school we become more mature , but we also become more responsible and we practices the values that we learn while we were children. In my opinion going to high school helps students decide what they want to work as in a future because in high school you can take a lot of classes that can explain how a certain career is and what is about, i think that really helps students makes that decision that is going to be for the rest of their life, so thats another reasons why i think is better to decide what students want to be while they are in high school not before.

Is it a good idea that students that enter to high school are expected to know what career they want to study and receive classes just for that career?; In my opinion is not a good idea because:

in high school you can really decide what you really want for your future.

In high school students can try different classes about careers, that can help them decide what they really want to study in a future. In high school they can really decide what career to study because they are older enough to see how a work is and what is basically about. In high school students have some field trip, they go to different collages and when they go there in the field trips they talk about different careers. that is the last reason why i think is better to decide what students want to be while they are in high school not before.

Is better that students decide what career they want to take while they are in high school not before because students might change their mentality, students can think more mature when they are almost graduating from high school, also in high school you can really decide what they really want for tehir future.

99D067A7FA9C,"Students should have a career that they want to commit to or even thinking about what they want to do in the future at a young age.

Students usually don't know what they want to do in the future or out of high school. It is good thing for students to commit to something they see their selves in for a long period of time. Students should already have a thought on what they like to do. They should have the mindset on what they want to do in the future as well. Parents don't want their kid/s to sit around the house all day. The parents would want the best for their kid/s and would be proud on whatever they want to do when they grow up.

Entering high school, they would have certain studies for students for what they want to do in the future. Teachers and counselors will tell you and help you what you need in the future and on what you want to do. Students will need a minimum of Sol's that they need to past and a selection of classes that they need to take. Teachers and counselors will ask you what colleges you want to go to or where you want to apply to. They will tell you what you need to do for you to get into a college that you are willing to go. Any teachers or counselors will help you on where you want to go or what you want to do with yourself in the future.

While students are trying to commit a career that they want to do, it might be a little stressful. Students having a career to commit to is really hard, over whelming, and even irritating. Committing to a career is a lot, but it is also a relief because you don't have to think last minute on what career you choose to do in life. Some students thinking or committing a career is fun to them. They want to get out of high school already just to see how life will work on what they want to do but, they should never rush on what's in front of them and have fun while it last.

Students should always have a career or even have a thought of in their mind for the future. They should always think about the future because if they don't it might effect them in some way. It is very important to think ahead of the game from everybody else. It is also important that students should care about the future. Students should have fun planning on their career instead of stressing about it all day and all night. Even thinking, planning, or committing to a career is such an amazing and exciting thing that all students should enjoy doing. It is a great idea that committing to a career at a young age is perfect because, students should not have worry later on and think to hard on what they want to do for themselves.

400B644C071E,"It might be really boring to add more time to school days. But you get to spend more time at home. Best thing that could ever happen to you. I think add one and a half hour to school each day sounds like a good idea for many reasons.

To begin with, I agree with the school board. One reason I agree is because you will have more summer time. Having more summer time is great because you can spend more time with family members that live in Virginia or that lives in another state. And you can travel to many states or countries and spend more days over there. Another reason i agree with the school boards because you will have less homework. The reason you will have less home work is because you can do all of it during class. And teachers can help you after you finish your class work. Another reason why i agree with the school board is because the school board will probably take a school day off. If the school board take a day off we will only have four school days. And we will have a longer weekend.

On the other hand, some people might disagree and think that the school board should not add more time. People might like school because they like to learn new subjects. One reason they probably disagree is because they like homework and get there grade up. To know how to do your homework you have to listen carefully and memorize the step to solve a problem. People that do there home get a good grade on there homework and even tests. Another reason is they will have less summer time. I think having less summer time will affect my life because i would have less time with my family, but others dont get affect because they rather be in school. It will be dreadful to be without my family for less time. The final reason people disagree with the school board is because they will have less time in class. I think having less time in each class will be better but i still think they should add one and a half hour to school each day. People who disagree would go home faster.

Finally, I have three more reasons why I agree with the school board. One other reason is because I will have less time to play video games. Playing video games all day is not a good idea. Playing video games can hurt you brain and can even make you lose some of your vision; it can lead up to getting glasses or contacts. Another reason why I agree is because we can be more educated. Being educated is really important. Being educated is important because it helps you with exams and tests. It even helps you on graduating with a diploma ang get you a job that pays you good. Final reason I agree is because I like when time goes really slow. The reason I like time to go slow is because you have more time to hang out with your friends and have a opportunity to do some activities with them. Friend will do anything for you and you have to do the same and give them respect have they give you respect.

If i was one of yall i would definitely add one and a half hour to school each day. I suggest you to agree because you can finish school slower and be with your friends. My advice is just to do your assignments and get it over with. Keep that in your head and think about the future. I think adding one and a half hour to school each day sounds like a fanatic idea for many reasons.  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,8.0

As may many people say that the negative attitude is way to succeed, however, a positive attitude, explain the performances of your doing for example Generic_Name got 50 out of 100, which she wanted on her presentation not because she did not do the work properly,but because the way she present her presentation and she was scared and nervous to present it in front of everyone. It was majorly graded on her performance, but next time she practiced her way to present her presentation five-six times and thought about how she can do this and she doesn't have to be scared of anything and she got 100 on it, which was her goal. Also. a sports team lose few time because the players not getting along or one is better than other, which they can change by thinking equally and being friendly to each other. It shows the optimistic behavior of human supports during their task.

Your past always reflects on your future. Everyone learns something from their mistakes or good memories. For example if Generic_Name did good on her presentation because she the way she presented, it illustrates that she more confident and positive to do her same presentation without worrying. If the sports player lost couple times they would not make same mistakes as they did it before. if you think and feel positives it will show it on your work. The effect changes your perspective to your life.

A39660CA003E,"Imagine that you like photography but they required you to get music, art, and drama instead of photography they will be upset. Although some people say that taking drama, music or a art class is required, but I disagree because it's their choice to take those classes or not to take those classes.

If you think that those classes are required, then your wrong because, they won't do any classes that are forced them to take. If they are forced then they might like it when the class goes on, but if you say take the class or you won't pass then they will pass the class then just not doing anything. Say one student who doesn't like art but he takes it and he goes on and become a popular artist, then people will think I should try those classes and see. Say, they did take the class because it was required but they fail, the passing average of that class will go from high to low because of it bring required. If they say it's required for half a year than full year then, I will choose they are but if it's for whole year I will choose they aren't required.

I think they aren't required to take those classes, because those classes aren't meant for them. Because say they want to go for other things after high school that doesn't need music, arts and drama then it was just a waste of their school time studying those, but not the one that you need for after high school. They will take it but they won't do anything in the class if they are forced to take what they doesn't like. I think school just have some class that are mandatory to take but elective aren't mandatory to take. Those classes should be elective than are required to take all those class.

In conclusion that, if they choose it's required to take those class, it might change their subject on what to do after school, but for some it will not change it. If they choose not to make it required than it will have their passing average higher than going low, and that the student can take the classes they want to take. So I think that those classes aren't required to take unless they want to take.

2F81111E7831,"Most student enjoy summer vacaction,but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that student do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall.

Most of the student have reason that is to much break during summer break, but I am disagree with the idea of change the schedule of vacaction time. Could be during summer break the student forget some information of school, but all student wait for summer because much student like to travel to their country during vacation time, or some student only can see their family during summer break and their like to pass time with them, I guess is better time to take vacation in summer. Also the eductors need to think about the thing they can do during summer break because during winter the weather is really bad and also is too much snow and is too cool for to go out side.

Another reason that why is bad idea to get break during winter is because in winter the job is slow, and the center recreational are close like the pool, beach, park, and the fair. I think 3-4 week break during summer is a little be of time to have fun with the family, and enjoy their vacation I dont see the main point of the change because if they change the longer break for winter it take the same time because they also want that student take a week break durin spring and falls; Is more complicated if they change the schedule.

Therefore is a bad idea to change because it should be the same way it doesnt matter what time or what station is the break it should be the same way, because if they do in winter they going to forget information, eather is not good idea because the student cant enjoy their break for the weather.

In conclution I am desagree with the idea and is better during summer break, because could be the same time that the student loose. ",3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,6.0
7A239E4D1966,"My thought on the prompt are that I think it's better to be active. Being active or doing something all the time is good. You can be very helpful by helping people out or doing chores. Doing something all the time can make you physically fit. You can be moving all the time and a lot it can be good exercise.

I like working out or helping people out especially my family. Many people enjoy or like to be active and it makes them feel good including myself. I can'not stay inactive for a long period of time like many people in this world. In some people's life activity play's a major role in there life's. Like a personal trainer or a coach.

Inactivity is sometimes bad especially if you do it for a long time. It can be frustrating to other people if everybody is working but you and they need your assistance. If I'am inactive for a long period of time i can get sick or really anybody if you have been laying around doing nothing for days. Your body needs movement or some type of exercise. That's why it's better to be active.

Therefore, inactivity can sometimes be good or necessary. For example, if you are watching a movie at the movie theater. You can'not be jumping and running all over the place you are going to get kicked out. In some situations when something bad is happening out side your home is better to stay as far away as you can and do'not intervene is better to stay idle.

Finally,I some occasions is inactivity serves a purpose. You do accomplish more if you stay active and you can meat your goals in life if you put hard work and not staying idle.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,7.0

I can tell people were having a lot of fun by their smiles on their face, and by running up and down the field. I can see people are having fun it made me want to have fun too. I remember the first time I went to the Community Park, then I went to the State Park, and also I went to the National Park.

The first reason, is when I went to the the Community Park for the first time. I could see this big blue, and yellow playground. Also I could see people running up and down at the Community Park having so much of fun. There was also other people playing tag with other people at the park. Lastly, the Community Park had so many fun equipment to play. Like the swing, slides, wall climbers and the monkey bars. There were a lot of people there so we had to wait for our turn to use every equipment they had at the Community Park.

Second reason, is when I went to the State Park for the first time too. I could remember walking under the trees with a nice wind blow to my face in a nice shadow made by the trees. Also I kept walking and I saw a lot of animals that were not attacking people. Animals that I saw were Frogs, Turtle, Fish, Lobsters, Birds, Snakes, Deer, and Ducks all over the park. Lastly, I saw their was a big river where people were fishing. Then Other people were swimming in the river water because it was a very hot day outside at the park.

Last reason, is when I went to the National Park for the first time also. The park has a lot of fun things that we can go look at and visit animals at the park. The animals they can go and visit are Monkeys, Snakes, Giraffes, Turtles, Tigers, Pandas, Birds, Frogs, Crocodiles, Gorillas, Sea Lions, Donkeys, Horses, Lions, Lizards, Iguana, and Elephants.

Behalf on the position I agreed Is , I love to be myself and be diverse with the people around me that don't like to be so hypocritical what so ever. Also, I like to make decisions on what Is valuable, or what Is not instead of someone telling me like If they were my mother or father. Therefore, In my job that I have right now I get a lot of people that give me so many opinions that, I don't be saying that much back to them.

Getting a bad grade on a test or quiz. Their are kids in middle and high school who study and at times get bad grades. These kids have trouble knowing that they failed their test or quiz. One way to provent this from happen is by having a good mindset. They can deepdown be mad, but if they put tell themselfs that ""i'll try harder next time"" they could do better on the retake or on the next quiz or test. Even when some kids that study a lot and fail some of they overreact during it.

Overreacting is another promble kids have. Some kids overreact by saying ""if i fail this i wont get a job"". Other times kids thing negativly about themselfs and they bring themselfs down. They could be telling theemselfs "" i'm going to fail"" or anything else instand of that they sould try telling them say ""i'm going to try to do my best. They dont know intill they try to do their best.

Having a good mindset can help. Havin a good mindset meaning to think positivly and to know that not having passed their test or anyting in life. That everyone had to start from one place and build on. Other times kids should learn from their mistakes. They might have or might have not fail and they shouldn't put it on themselfs because they could fail if not.

These are ways to provent kids from having a bad attitude to having a good attitude during their difficult time. They should try to be more calm and the should try to not overreact at much. They should also try to have a good mindset during it.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,6.0

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online, or video conferencing. Student would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is not teacher help, and cheater.

To begin with, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is no teacher help. For example, Generic_Name is doing his work online and there is something that he not understand, he will need the teacher help,or the teacher explication on how to do it, all students need some times help for the teacher. In conclusion, students have to attend classes from school because the teachers can bring their helps for anything you not understand.

Secondly, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because they can cheat on. For example, Generic_Name is working on geometry and she don't know how to do parallels, the only way that she can work on it, is cheating, she can take out her phone and search the answer from the internet.

However many people think that first impression are impossible to change, people can change their first impression, if they knows more about each other and if a person is passing by a struggling in their life.

People can change their first impression if they know more about each other, for example if a person that meet another at the mall they will have no time to talk about what they like to do in their free time because they has to make their purchases and my friend Generic_Name has a story with a girl that he likes, he said that was difficult to talk with her because that first time he talk to here was in the lunch line and she was hungry so she dont even pay attention to him, one day both of them have detention they star talking and meet more about each other, people can change their first impression if they give the according time to each person.

A person can fix his first impression if that person was no notified about what struggles was happened the other person that day, for example when the Algebra teacher meet Generic_Name, he said that Generic_Name was quiet because Generic_Name do not like talk to much, one day Generic_Name said that he just come from El Salvador and do not speak too much English and a person that has lost a family-member if someone tried to meet him on those days anyone will be said that he's must depress or sad because non of them know the truth.

We don't have any limits to grow up and formed our selfs. We have the right of choose what we want. If our character is good or not we can still make our self without other influences. The influence of what sometimes see is not always helpful.

I had to make my own choices without seen the influence of others. For me is better to create my own future because i choose it. I feel more prepare and i also learned about it. Sometimes seen what others do or their influence does not help us think about what we really want.

003969F4EDB6,"Philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing.""

I believe that setting a good example by ones own behavior is the best way to influence other people.

I believe this because people look up to others, actions speak louder than words, and it's always in peoples life.

I will explain my reasoning so let me get right into it.

The first reason as to why I believe setting a good example by ones own behavior is the best way to influence others is because people look up to others.

Both adults and kids alike are influenced by other peoples actions everyday.

Everybody has a hero or role model that they look upon and are motivated to copy them.

It's what the role model does that effects what the person that looks up to them do.

For example, let's say that an actor on a kids television show is acting all good and respecting his parents.

The results would be that kids that watch that show would copy him by acting good as well as respecting their parents.

The second reason as to why I believe setting a good example, by ones own behavior, is the best way to influence others is because actions speak louder than words.

This old saying is a swell example of this.

Actions are usually found to give off more feeling and emotion than words.

Since actions are visible they have more of an effect on inspiring and influencing other people.

For example, giving a high five gives off a better example of being a good sport than saying, ""Good job.""

The last reason as to why I believe setting a good example, by ones own behavior, is the best way to influence others is because it's always in peoples life.

People don't really know how to act when they are born, they attempt to mimic other people.

Kids grow up following the examples that their parents gave them.

Words don't really mean anything to them since they don't understand them yet.

As people grow up their ideals and ideas are constantly changing by other people around them.

People are then not effected by words much than they are effected by other peoples actions.

Setting examples will always be in our lives, no matter what.

Some people say that there are other ways to influence others.

They say that taking physical action is a better way to influence others.

These people are wrong.

They're wrong because physical action doesn't really influence others, it actually makes a person want to be the opposite.

Furthermore, setting good examples work out better than physical action because it's more influential from a long distance than being up close to physically inspire someone.

In conclusion, because of people looking up to others, actions speaking louder than words and it always being in peoples life, my reasons are valid.

These are all the reasons as to why I believe setting a good example by ones own behavior is the best way to influence others.

Additionally, you should go out and set a good example for your kids or friends, since it's the only way to influence others.  ",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,9.0

I want to flip flop houses so I want to learn more about this and I want the manager of the business pick us so we can learn how those a work.

One reason, That you should pick us is how do you know if the house is good to flip and know if you going to make more money. People think that you should look in area that are growing and get house that are bad and flip the house so you can sell it for more and get more money then you payed the house and the things that made the house better.

Second reason, the manager should pick our class so we can learn How does the business work like how many house do you need to buy so that the work proceed and process. I heard that people buy three house each 6 mouth so they can work on it because some houses take one month and other houses take 4 month. Then you got to wait for the houses to sell that can take weeks or even months to sell the house to get the money.

third reason, That the manager should pick us that we want to know that if the wait of getting the money is worth it by waiting to the house to can be ready and wait so the house can get sold. People I heard that money that you wait six mouth is worth it because the money that the person get back is like more twenty thousand more on the house that you can buy a better house in a better place or keep some money. The money that you get can make a lot.

That why the manager of the real state business should pick us to visit and learn about the work because students want to learn more about this job and have question more so in the future that students will know about more then the job and maybe in there life working in this area so they can make money to.

First of all students should talk to their parents before taking any desicion, them both need to consider that if the student gets involved in many activities, then they will not have time to do any work from school.

If the students spend too much time on the activities, then he/she would not have time for them other responsabilities. The school should make an runion for parents, so they can agree on the terms that the school want. Activities at school should not be controling, or making the students join so many activities.

If the student does not do the school work, then they will have bad grades, that will affect them by not being able to participate anymore in any of the school actiities. Students should not be able to participate in more than two activities at school. because they will get tired a lot, and therefore they will not do their homeworks. Participating in any of the activities should also be a credit for the students.

Schools are responsable for any activite that it is happening in school, they should contact parents, and also have a reunion, so they would get the parents opinions. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the students, should considered any type of activitie that the student wants to get involved in. Participating in school it is good for students, but not when they do extraactivities.

I think that well be a good idea because kids get to learn about other foods,they also get kids to be healthier, and maybe find a brand new favorite food. trying out new food is always good you well never know if you like something tell you try it you cant judge a book by its cover.

Food can be healthy or not health but if schools wanted to they can serve healthy foods that can fills kids stomach with joy. Schools can serve variety of food like chicken , meat , salads , rice and beans , fruits , and so much more but the foods not the only thing in lunch schools should give milk and water for there drinks.

Students can also find there favorite food testing food at school so i think schools should change there luch menu. Teach students to be healthy and have a great mind.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,6.0

I'm desagree too because students like that food is thire favorite food and also me i like that food but is time to make change.

Exemple:if the 40% say no and 60% say yes that mean that will change the menu and will change ,but if the thing change with the 60 say no that mean no will cnhange.

You would want to go to the Bahamas because the beach is crystal clear. You can see all the baby fish that are swimming around you which is so cool! I always try to catch one but it never works. There will also be very colorful snails stuck on the rocks. They look poisonous so I never try to touch them. You can also go surfing there. I am too scared to surf so I just lay down on the surf board and relax. There are coconut trees near the beach which looks really cool. One of my favorite parts is when big boats pass by and big waves come your way.

Another reason why you would want to go to the Bahamas is because the restraints there are like no other restraints here. The restraints there look big and fancy. The best part is that you get to eat at a restraint for every meal because there is no store there for you to buy food and cook it up. Although that may be a little expensive, but you have to keep in mind that you are on vacation. It takes about ten to fifteen minutes for them to serve your food. I don't know about you, but to me that is not long at all. The food taste so good! They also never over cook your food too! One of my favorite dishes is the shrimp pasta. If you go to the bathroom it is super clean and it smells good too. I hate it when I go in a bathroom that is dirty and smells bad.

Another reason why you would want to go to the Bahamas is because of the awesome, clean, and fancy hotels there. The hotels there are nice and refreshing. It is super clean. There are two closets, two beds, and one bathroom which is pretty good if you ask me. There is also a big TV right in front of the two beds. There is also free WiFi for you to use but that is kinda unless when you have a big TV right in front of you unless if you want to play games on your phone which is what I do. There is also a mini fridge for you to put your water so when your hot just grab the icy cold water out of the fridge to drink. The best part is that there is air conditioning and it actually works.

These are all the reasons why you should go to the Bahamas. All I am trying to say is that the Bahamas is a great place to visit with your family and friends. If you ever get a chance to go on vacation, go to the Bahamas and you won't regret it.",4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,8.0
8D00FE53EC71,"Should students identify a career by the time they enter high school at a young age? do you agree or disagree

I'm disagree because they still too young to get a career and they just enter high school, and to be in career is a lot of responsibility, and they still need to learn more to be in career, because learning a career is like they are learning a job, and to learn about a job that you want to do for the rest of your life you need to know more like they did just enter to high school you need to learn more and be preparation and i think the grades has to be A, B, C, I think that how their grade has to be and when they grade are good and they are passing they can be in a career when they are in 10 grade but not in 9 grade so that's why i'm not agree because they can not came to high school and get a career and 50% of the students in 9 grade they are not passing their class to get a career.

First they are some students that just enter to high school and they still don't know about responsibility, and career is a lot of responsibility, and it's only for junior and seniors and when they are in

10 grade if they had English 10 they can sign in for a career, and get ready for a career, and they can choice what ever career they want like be a nursing, mechanic ,and etc and they can choice like to career and what ever they say that they can choice they will study for it.

Second if they are 16 years old they can choice a career, but if they are not 16 years old they can not choice a career they are still young but still like 50% of the students in 10 grade they don't give them a change to be in a career like me they did not have me a change I want to be a nursing but they did not have a change, and now i think i will to college and study to be a teacher or I don't really know because at the same time I think ""I want to be a famous"" like try to be in a movie or I don't really know what career i want to be in I'm junior and I still don't know what career I want to take because they did not have us other choices to study about, I wish we could had other choices to study in school not like nursing because other students that they want to be other things, but if we application to be a nursing it doesn't always have everyone at school a opportunity, they are some students that they want to be nursing and they applicate and they don't have them a chance but if that students doesn't study more, they will not have him/her the opportunity to study for nursing so my opinion is that they should not allow students that they just enter to school get a career.

third I think that they should talk with them about career before they are in 10 grade and ask them if they are really to sign in for a career and they should think about what career they want to be in, but they are still young they should not be in young age if the are 16 years old or older them 17 they should allow to choice a career, bu if they are not older them 16 years old they should not allow what career they want to do they should talk to them about career but leave them choice a career.

My opinion is that they should not let them choice a career because they are still to young and they need to know more about responsibility like they should start learning about responsibility my best friend Generic_Name she is in 9 grade, and she know about responsibility she take care of her little brother and she know what career she want to be she want to be a soccer player she is good in soccer and she is so nice and good friends they should be more 9 grades like my best friends that they already know about responsibility and they are 9 grades that they don't even respect the teacher and their family so that means that they still don't know about responsibility, and they should respect the teacher and their family because that show that they know about responsibility, some students that they enter to high school they don't respect even students from 10, 11 ,12 grade so that's why they should not allow thme selected a career first they had to show respect to they teacher, family, and their self.

On all the schools they help the student to choose a career. They want the best for the student.

I think that is good idea because if someone want to be doctor or teacher they help to choose the best career. I think that is important because it help you more. I know my brother friend he is teacher and he is 23 years old. Because he choose a career when he was in young age he or someone help him to choose a good career for him. The school is that friend that you have because they choose the career that you want to take.

Time control can be very helpful when it comes to school work or even in my life style it could come in handy, one of the way I could use it in school is by knowing when to have fun and when to pay attain in class.

D925E8553B9D,"I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. This the modern way of studying in the majority of the world, so that can give more chance to all students who don't have time to be in school everyday. That would by very easy way for all special students who are disable or sick.

Every student has a different life from another, so at this time most students are working and studying at the same time. The online classes are benefit all students who dont have the time to be in school on time, work far of the schools' building, and has family. For example, in my school their are around thirty girls are marred , and have family or kid need to take care of. I knew some of them are using the online studying program with some classes, so they make their work way better than other who are missing their classes at lees once a week. in addition this would be helpful to all students planing to go to the College, For 60% of the College and University classes and exams should be taking online.

Also,the most benefit's people are the disable people. That will be the biggest gift in the life to have their education like every kid. They would study with other kids from home and share their life with them, so that will be so useful to make our kids, sister, and brothers are equal with other students and get the knowledge and skills from their schools' life. Moreover, that will take off a lot of expenses for the counties and families they spend on the private schools, so that is become a great benefit to the society. That will benefit all families, to keep their work, in staid of driving their kids for to long time twice in the day. Also, we the students are going to have the opportunity to make up the classes or take them from home, when we sick , late or have no way to be in school. I think this what will be the most common study way in the next ten year later.

Some ideas and people think that is not the right way to study or be educate, because they think most of student will use this to not be in school and being out of the school weather of teaching. With all my respect to all people and ideas rejected the online study' program, and in polite way, that online program for the kids who were not graduated from all schools level, from Elementary to High school, cannot take these online classes with out showing up their acceptable purpose and family agreement, so that how would schools be control the way of education for students.

These were some of to many benefits of the online studying and some of the good affection to the students' life and education. We should be use all the technology, that we have to make our life easier, but we need to control every device and plan the right way to our kids to use it with.

In short, The online study option is one of the modern useful way to learn and benefit idea for all the students and the society.       ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,7.0
40E6BC53EC01,"Just imagine you have an important basketball game at your school. Since you have three hours to get to the school, you decided to go watch a movie with some friends. When the movie finished you realize is already late, and that you need to go home to get the basketball uniform and your water. Ten blocks away your house you realize that the traffic is getting for ever, you feel like is never going to end,

that the minutes passed so slowly, really nervous, and sweaty. When you get home and check the clock you see you have just twenty minutes to get ready and go to school, your mom is screaming at you really angry because she is always telling me to be responsible. You arrived your team is already playing without you. Since you get there late Generic_Name tells, ""You are not going to play today, because you are not responsible."" I think a good lesson I can teach to the kids is responsibility at home, school projects, and sports.

First, responsibility at home is really important because is were we live, and when you are responsible you show respect to your parents. One day my best friend Generic_Name called me because she wanted to get a coffee and tell me she was really nervous of failing the year because she have not been responsible. I told her, ""I am going to ask my mom."" When i asked my mom she told me really angry, ""Have you fix your room and wash the dishes?"" I respond, ""I have fixed my room, but I have not washed the dishes."" I supposed that she was angry so that was an no. I tell

Generic_Name I cannot go, and she was really sad about it. Later I realized that I was not responsible about doing my duties at home. That is why you need to be responsible of doing your duties at home.

Next, you need to be responsible with school projects because in this way you get better grades. When I was in elementary school I remember I need to do a science project for the science fair. I wanted to get the first place of all the school cause I knew that i will feel really happy of it. I decided to do a wave experiment, but it was really complex and i knew it would take a long time to do it. I collect all the materials and build it, but i did not remember about the poster. The poster need to be really big and with the hypothesis, procedure,

materials, results, and pictures. I did not make my best work in that poster, so I get i ninety percent and third place. I feel really good about the results, but I learn that in order to be better we need to be responsible at school.

Finally, responsibility at sports. I did not know we needed to be responsible when practicing any sport. Just imagine you have the last soccer game of the year. Generic_Name have told you many times the directions of what you need to do all the week before the game, but you have not follow them correctly. One of the directions was eat healthy, but you have been eating pizza all the week. Other direction was drink a lot of water every day, but instead of drinking water you drink soda. The day of the game has came, and you did not get prepared because you did not wanted to be responsible. When you are at the middle of the game you start to feel really dizzy. Generic_Name and the nurse take you out, and tell you why are you so ill. In sports you need to be responsible of your health.

Responsibility is what make us be better. In think responsibility help us have a better place to live. I list three ways we can show we are responsible. To show the importance of it. Ways we can show we are responsible are making duties at home, at school, and practicing any sport.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0
7085DB089317,"Do you believe that people can choose their own character traits or are they affected by influence beyond our control? Having self control over their character traits is something that people can master and for others it is very difficult. Sometimes people are influenced by other people and this causes them to act or be a certain way. Although some people can have self control and manage to choose their character traits, people are most often influenced by other people like family members or friends.

Parents and family members are the people who influence people the most. Parents out of all people know how to raise their children and know how they want them to be when they grow up. For example parents show their children manors and how to be respectful to others. You can also be influenced by you siblings, for example you can have and older sibling that plays a sport or has some type of skill that you would like to master as well.

If you play a sport or have some other type of activity you do in school or out you can pick up some character traits from your teammates or friends. For example if you do any kind of sport from experience your teammates and coaches will influence you to reach your goals or accomplish what youve been wanting to for a long time. Friends can also have a big impact on the type of character traits you have. For example if your friends get good grades and you getting grades that are lower then their they can influence you to work harder and bring your grades up.

Firstly knowing how bad of an influence teens can be to each other it is important to know that the violence wont decrease as much neither the bad decisions teens make on a daily bases, but it can make an impotant role when it comes to a better sleeping schedule, this would help many teens to not be sleepy during school hours. Even though its not a hundred percent sure that teens will go to sleep exactly at 10 p. m. but it would decrease the chances of teen violence in streets, or any consequence that could happen at nigth. This means avoiding a kidnap or a major violence with an over age person because adults often ingage in more dangerous things like being a gang member, a traficant, or an asassin, etc. Secondly this law would also benefit the childrens parents, many parents have early sleeping schedules because they have to wake up early at midnight to go to work and letting their children out for too long can be stressing for some. A very important thing to recognize if the law is adopted is that under age people should not be outside after 10 p. m. however if they are acompained with an adult the law would not be broken, an emergency could happen and a family would have to be together, and if this law does not permit teens to step outside at night, if an emerency happens it would not be right for them to stay alone in the house. The curfew law could make a change in society for the better, if teens are not able to be so freely to do anything like they are sometimes, probably the violence and bad decisions would decrease and teens would be safe in many aspects.

Ones the city council makes this law active, an advantage of it can be that the security would be better and a lot more strict, by any means if they see a teen outside after the requested hours, he or she would serve in some type of punishment for a short period of time, this system makes sure that teens understand that the new law has to be followed and not ignored.

Teachers and students should start meeting after school this idea would benefit students by getting extra support, turning assignments on time get a better understanding of the things that the teacher teach on class, establishing the club would help those students who don't turn in assignments on time or those who like to do things early.

In order to students to be successful they need extra support a better explanation of the things they learn, many students struggle with the assignments and most of them don't ask for support through the school year I have seen many students raping the assignments because they don't understand them, but if the school make the the idea of starting a club there would be no excuse for students to not be successful in their homework, tests, and class assignments.

Students should start turning assignments on time specially those who don't turn in on time, the club would help many students like instead of going home and forgot that they have assignments to do they could come and join the after school homework club. I have friends who like to do homework and be successful, but the problem is that they don't understand the assignments and if someone don't understand something why should they do it because either way they going to get the assignment wrong the school must provide more support for students.

In addition the club could not be just of getting help or finish assignments early, the club could be a place were students can find support and motivation in order to be a better person on life many students don't care about school because they don't find the good thing about it maybe because they need a motivation to be at school the after school club could be a place where people can meet and share ideas or meet each other and make a friendship helping each other to understand better the thing that they don't understand.

In conclusion the school must make the after school club in order to get more successful students and to also help and motivate students to do their assignments and turning them on time. extra support is a better way to understand the things you don't understand, turning assignments make a student seem responsible and also get a good admiration of others making friends and share, discuss thing together is a better way to solve a problem that they had.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,5.0
FE822B3E72FC,"On this time most the people had failures on their life, a failure is something that always gonna happen on the life. Some people get it on the good way and they make of each failure a lesson for their life , also a failure give to you the motivation that you need to do your best , each failure make you more stronger and make you be alert on your next step

Some people get the failures on good way when they learn about it. All the failures have a lesson for your life, the first reason why a failure give you a lesson is because. If you never do it wrong you will never learn about the failure. Second you learn about the failure when you made it before and you do again but now you do it good for example. If your teacher give you 10 days to do a presentation on your computer and, the first day you say i will do it tomorrow and you say the same the next day until a night before the day that you have to turn the work you start do it , and you don't have enough time and you get a bad grade. The next day it was a failure and you will learn about it because the next time you will do it on time.

A failure give to you the motivation that you need to do your best the next time. When you do something wrong for first time you feel bad and you want to do it wrong again , inclusively if it was a little mistake you don't want to and you got motivation. Most the people owners of big companies obtain motivation when they have a failure on a business, they don't give up they get motivation to do their best on the next business for example. You went to your work and it's your first day and your boss told you that you have to finish all of your signatures 10 minutes before the end of the day , and you finish it 15 minutes after , your boss can get mad and give you a warning and you have to get it like a motivation to do your best the next day and keep going.

Each failure make you more stronger and make you be alert on your next step. The failure coming and coming on ours life sometimes it come hurt and sometimes it doesn't, all of those make you more stronger, give you a lesson and make you be alert for don't get it mistake again. It make you more stronger means that you don't gonna feel weak again when you commit a mistake , also you gonna be alert and take your precautions on your next step for example. If you are on a team of soccer and you are the goalkeeper, and while you are talking with a friends , one of the other team hit the ball and make a score it was your fault. Your coach gonna scold you for it but you gonna be alert for the next time and you also gonna be more stronger because you learn about of your mistake.

For example in sports people need to be active so they can accomplish their goals, people also need to be active in school like they always need to be studying so they can keep their grades up and graduate with honors.

in sports people need to be determine to never be idle. for example soccer player always need to be practicing with their teams so they can become better as a whole and accomplish their goals like becoming champion or winning the soccer league. for instance Cristiano Ronaldo is a Real Madrid soccer player and they are always active determined to be the best. Cristiano Ronado is always practicing so he can be the best soccer player. Real Madrid has won Three Champions league trophies in arrow when Cristiano was in Real Madrid because he was the best goal scorer in the team. not only in sports people need to be determine to never be idle but also in school.

In school student also need to be determined to never be idle. For example student need to always study for test or so keep their grade up so they can be an honor roll student. If student do not study they might get a horrible grade on a test also if people do not do their class assignment they will have a bad grade in the class. in other word student can not make it of they are idle or lazy.

people always need to be active to accomplish more in life. in sport people should never be idle because if they are they will never improve they skills. students also need to be active in school so they can not forget what they have learned in class and so they can have a better understanding of the subjects. in conclusion being idle will never help people accomplish their goals in life.",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,5.0

32B2FDA9D3ED,"Always doing something will always be an accomplishment and doing nothing will never be an accomplishment anybody knows tht.

Always doing something in your life can be an accomplishment because you're doing something with your life and not just sitting around doing nothing. That why being an inactivity person does not do anything for you in your life you don't get anywhere in life.

First of all, When you are doing something like being active or if you have a job your doing something your accomplishing things, your getting experience, and your learning how to be a hard worker. You are active if you are going to working as in having a job. For example, I'm working in a restuartant as a waiter or a cashier i'm a hard worker because I went out of my way to find a job that I am willing to work at. I'm an active person because I am actually putting the time and effort into having the job and making money off of it. Also at the same time of having the job I am accomplishing something by learning how to be a waiter or be a cashier. Accomplish means mastering something by doing something that you did yourself. Being inactive is not a good thing if you are wondering let me tell you how.

In addition, being inactive can be the worst thing you can do in a way it can kind of ruin your life. For example, People without jobs and in this case they are adults. Not having a job when you're an adult can be the most horrific thing ever because if you don't have no money you can't buy any food, clothes, and so much more that you need in life. Another most important thing to having in life is to having a roof over your head, so you can stay warm, out of the rain, and having somewhere to sleep. Also another reason why having money is important is what if you have a baby you need to take care of you have to do everything possible for the baby to have a home, make sure the baby eats, having to buy daipers, and for them to wear harm clothes so they don't have to get sick. Speaking of sick, what if the baby gets sick you would take them to the hospital of course but would you having enough money to pay off the hospital bill and if you don't the baby will stay in the hospital until you can pay off the bill. The things it will take for that to happen is to be active, and hard working then you will accomplish in paying the hospital bill for your baby. These are my reasons and I hope people will make the right choice when it comes to being active or inactive.

Lastly, Me personally I'm an active person I don't always like to be inside all the time so I go outside and do the thing that I love doing best and is to play soccer. I'm about to tell you my way of accomplishing something by doing it. When I was three years ago my father loved to play soccer, he loved it so much that he wanted me to learn how to play it. As I was growing up I was getting more and more attached to soccer. When I reached to the age of ten my father knew I was ready to be on a soccer team, so he did and found a team that my cousin was in. The name of the team was called Generic_Name in english meaning Generic_Name, my father ask the coach if i could play on the day of my first game and the coach said, is he ready, my father replied, yes of course i wouldn't be asking you if he wasn't. So they gave me a uniform and interduced me to everyone on the team and so we put all our hands in the middle and on three we shouted Generic_Name!!!. So we all got in to position and I was playing left wing, each half was thirty minutes ,and after those thirty minutes were past we won and finish the game with the score of four to three I scored all four goal in my first soccer match I was so happy and my father was so proud of me for that. Ever since that day I've been focusing so hard to becoming better at soccer and trying to accomplish my dream in becoming a professional soccer player. I know i'm going to accomplish it because I never give up especailly in soccer, its the reason why I am the person I am today and I will never let that go.

These are reasons why doing something and being inactive are different and it can change your life in different ways but for me I prefer something and being active because want to get somewhere in my life and be successful as well so I hope this will inspire you in to doing and making the choice, never give up.

D2E545CFEBF3,"I would agree and disagree at the same time because their can be good reason and bad reason of why it good to extend 2 hours of school and working for 10 hours each day. My first reason is that it good extending the 2 hours helps you learn more things and catch up with any work. What is good about Working for 10 hours each day is that you will have money for colloge and save up. What is bad for working 10 hours is that you will be tired and sleepy.

For example if you work four-day week you should work at least for 8 hours only because you need to get enought sleep, leave some time for home work. But it also can be good because you can only work for four-days and rest the week days. Working more than 8 hours you will feel tired,sleepy and frustrated. Therefore it better to work only 8 hours instead of 10 hours because it too much,as a result you can get bad consequence or bad grades.

My other reason is that I think school should not follow this model because working each day 10 hours it too much. However their can be bad consequence of working 10 hours and extendidng

2 hours in school. My first reason is that you can be tired and not listining to the teacher while she teaching. Second reason is that if you extend the hours of school many student will be livid for staying more hours in school.

I think that the school should not extend the hours is because some teachers need to be in places too,needs to rest and also needs more time on grading papers. I also think that many students have part time jobs and also they need to be somewhere. Some students will be tired and sleepy. Another reason I have is that student needs to go home early to go do their homework,rest alittle.    ",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,5.0
907FC59841EC,"I disagree to school board adding an half hours to school each day. I think is bad because adding another half hour to takes time away from there family and it takes to be with there family.

some children do not have time to see their family in the week days because there mom or dad comes home after they are going to sleep or before they go to school but maybe Fridays to Sundays is when they can see their family. Some students don't have time to say a few hours because some students have sports to do or they are going do something else at home or have to go see the doctor.

If they add a half hour to the school system I think all most all of the student will not come to school half of the school year. I disagree to the school board adding a half hour to school each day. I been to school all year except when I have to go the doctor for cheek up that is the only time I miss school. I play sports so I do not have time say a little bet longer of school or I am not on the term anymore.

To sum up I think school should be the some as it is or take sum time of school because is too long to add time to it. All in all school help as to learn.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,5.0
CE8164B8FD8E,"I don't think in my school should follow this model because is a lot of work to do and some students have a jod right after school so they can not stay two more hours at school. In some point this can help students to understand class they also can get more help from the teacher because they have more time to be in school,maybe we can get better grade if the school follow the moled but if there doing that many students will quiet to school because we have many responsibility to take care after school. I know the teacher have family and some of theme have children and there are going to be in the school for two more hours too so, I don't think that school should follow this model.

One of the may reason to not extend the school is that affect the students like I said before we need to work after school, I know we get so many benefits if we get two more hours of school but what about with those problems that we need to resolve after school and by to way even teacher and students need time to have funny to friends and family so if get those two hours extra that means teacher have to work more to have something to teach to the students and that need to be long because they have more time with the students in the classroom.

Second reason to not follow this model is that are gonna be so tired because if they extend the school time we will be out from school around 4 p. m then we going home we nned to do homework and all those stuff and sometime we have to do project so, imagine how tired we are gonna be. Sound funny to be in school more time but are body need to rest.

One more reason to not accept that model is that food some person don't eat the food from school some that will be another problem because they need to get off more early to make lunch to school and take some more snack that is something that reduce the energy in the students if we not sleep well are energy go down.

In conclusion I don't think that is a good idea to follow that model is to much work and is something that affect even teacher and students in some part that can the students but anyway some of us need to work and have time to do are homework/project after school and we need time to rest well. So I don't time my school should follow that model.",2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,5.0

68E0C70F0193,"Some people believe you can prove something by yourself. However, you can be yourself or you can be something else. Because you can see yourself the things you are capable of doing, and you can achieve more by yourself, and it takes time to accomplish something that is hard and difficult, and impress yourself that you can handle small and big things. First, being by yourself is like you don't need someone to help you that you are independent enough to know the problem, Second, you need patience and dedication to accomplish something. Lastly, if you are by yourself you can be more responsible and take responsibilities. People can see yourself from different environment or in your surroundings because you don't know and never know if its gonna happen well or not. The more you do on yourself the greater the outcome will reveal. you can see yourself that you have a lot of opportunity.

Nonetheless, youself must have a experience to this typical type of thing.

Some people say through something else you can do the impossible to possible because its your passion and you can exceed yourself to the limit and if you feel unsure about it make yourself nothing to lose. people make mistakes in order to succeed, and be as you are as you see as i am. because you choose the right decision that you made is correct, and for your happy thoughts this is you goal for yourself. you have the chance to rewind yourself and live again. Change the world and try to figure out the things that are worth the wait. make yourself feel brand new at all times, and don't lose faith on yourself. Be hopeful and make way on yourself. Take risk and sacrifice to yourself to earn gratitude for something you do, and stay ahead for the better and best future. Understand each and every situation for yourself and try hard but you gotta try harder to accomplished, at the end of the day you ask yourself what are the things the you are good at and things that you are not. Observe and listen to yourself and prepared what is coming and remember to have respect to yourself. This is your obligation for yourself to improve more things. Therefore, you make choices for yourself and you don't look back. It takes a lot of time to process to know what are the things that your good at and if you are really interested in it, and the work may not be difficult as it seem to be, and deal the consequences that are not allowed to yourself. other people are negative when it comes to dealing by yourself because they don't wanna be right there are focusing what is wrong and not listening to other peoples opinion.

I agree for the possitive attitude is the key. Because is good when you have a very good attitude. Also if you got a good attitide you can has positive thins in your life you can has to many fiend. And you can't have problems. because you, are very positive in your success life. You will , make very good decision, for your posiive life. The things most important in your kife is you get a job you need to have a attitude . Because if you don't have a good attitude you can improve in your life, The society if bad with you .Because you don't have agood attitude and , but you has to be possitive in your life to has a good attitude in your life.

Also sometime is good but some day is no because is a hard work to have a good attitude when a person don't want to talk to you that why is very hard to be positive Because sometime people talk bad thing about, you and you dont have a good raction in your life and the is not good for me and you need to calm down to will you have a positive thing in your life you has to wait for everythin nothing is easy in this life.

For example , you will has to have a good attitude ,well had to has positive things in your life to be a very good person , and yopu need to be a very good person because the society can said the you has a very great attitude in your life, And you can make where ever you wants if you have a very good positive attitude with your life and anything. Also you can make your own positive attitude not one make your decisions every one help to you has a positive life to have a very good decisiond.

When you has a great good positive attitude for your life is when you got everythin right .You can't worry for anything for the only thing the you can importam is to have a attitude right and the people dont talk bad about you, and the society. I think the positive life is the most importamt in every life. Every single life has to be positive an got a very good attitude. And every body cant have a greAt position to make the society most better.

I was thinking the attitude is very importamt for every body because if you don't have a great attitide you can get a job . Because in a job need people with a positive attitud. Also you can't improve and ,any job the you, cant have because you got a very greatt positive attitude about , you be very friendly every peron and every person who not have a very good attitude, the person never improve because,i think no body want a person the is not positive in his on life in every work need people with a very geat positive in his own life in has a great attitude   ",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,5.0
0D0CADFF33DF,"Imagine being a doll that is being controlled and someone telling you that this is your character traits. You don't have control on your own character trait because you let others influence you to think that's what your character trait is. Many people let others pick what their character trait is instead of doing it on your own and learning who you are and who you want to be and/or let others decide what their character trait is or are obligated to be this this person their not. Most let others decide because they don't know who they want to be or what others want them to be.

I agree with this prompt because you are obligated to because the other person is in control of your life, you let others choose because you aren't sure who you want to be, and you choose what you want your character trait to be.

You are obligated to because the other person is in control of your life and will make you feel vulnerable if you don't do as they say; they are the ones in power with what your character trait is and who you are going to be. An example can be your parents especially your mom that raises you. It might not be all mothers out there but most of them will raise a child and tell them what their character trait is going to be. Another example can be is if you are in a situation and it's between your life or death and the person makes you choose what your character trait is when that is not who you want to be but your life is on the line. Whoever you choose to be reflects who and what you are going to be in the future.

You let others choose what your character trait is because you are not sure what your character trait is and don't know who you want to be.

Many people tell each other that this is who they are and just influences people to tell you that's who you are. How will you know that for sure though if you cannot even figure out what your character trait is on your own and if that is what you choose it to be. This is where you over think about your character trait and just take your friends or any other person's opinion about who you are and what your trait is. If you are not sure who and what your character trait is just learn more about yourself and don't take anyone else's opinion and make that your character trait.

You choose what you want your character trait to be because you have the power to control who and what you want to be and not what other's have to say what your character trait is. You yourself choose to make what your character will be.

The best thing that a person can do to figure out who and what they want to be and what their trait is going to be is listing what you like about yourself by doing pros and cons. You will know your character trait when you feel comfortable and you love yourself for making another person smile and making their day. Along the way you will learn new things you did not know about yourself. We get to choose our own character traits not others, let that be a valuable lesson.

In conclusion you yourself choose what your character traits are going to be and not by others because you have the power to choose who you are and what your character traits is going to be.",3.5,2.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,7.0
3237F0C6E955,"I think it is a negative effect because, we are not talking to another person and we are there just using our phone. If we didn't have a cell phone our life wouldn't be that hard to get distracted. As soonest our phone rings, we will go and check what it was. Their is a lot of childrens under the age of ten that has a phone, they would not have a good childhood like us. However, the phone helps you out a lot like calling someone to let them know that you're sick, leaving a reminder for you when soccer practice starts, and when you have an a appoitment.

Although using the phone to shop is a good idea it makes our life faster. When ever we want to buy something online we just go to Amazon and check for the items the we need for us. They are many apps now that we can use to buy stuff for example Walmart has an app, where we just buy something and we go to them and they would go drop it off at the pick up location and that's something good about it.

However, people can check out books online like the Iphone as an app where you can buy books and read it right away. Also reading on the phone will be nice when you get bored the phone will be there and the book app. The appstore has many books where you can read like all the books I bought one call Maze of Runners it's a interesting book. You can also do another langagues if it let's you.

Gaming on the phone might be a bad idea because a lot of teenagers play on the phone for hours and disrespect their mother, when their mom tells them to turn off the phone and they respond with a no. The phone can have many games but your phone will be not longer working when it has more then 10 games.

A reason why technology is bad is because it damage our brains and we have to enjoy our world so we can be more happy.

Best support for your idea is examples. I think is the only thing for support your idea. You don't have other options But never mind you have a one more way for influence others everybody know this way because is the best way of everything it is the money.

Once upon a time me and my friend talking about one film (i did not remember the film name know.) we are saying only examples (because we know is the best way for support our ideas) he is saying one example i am saying another and we are talking like a 30 or 35 min finally i gave up and i said if you accept my idea i will buy a large size pizza and he said OK.

After for this conversation i learned example and money is not the main thing influencing others; it is the only thing

For people that like to do what they do they have some stuff that make them feel acomplishwith what they do for example:

The space are were they work at.

Former British Prime says ""seccess consistes of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiams"" this is the reallity, this is a righ idea, because if we never try to do it so, then we never will get on our goals, we have to try and fail and try again that's how life works for everybody.

9D15DAF11FA8,"Do you think failure play's in the pursuit of success? Many do think so and others don't ,personally i believe failure does come around all the time. Here are my three reasons why i think failure plays in your success. Since i was small attending elementary school things didn't go the way i wanted it to go. I always had a thought almost like a future vision but failing at your goals made me better and made me work harder. When ever you fail keep on trying for better results. Not everything you want or imagine will go the way you want to. The last reason would be failure will make you work harder for better results and can lead to better opportunities.

Most people think failure is an option and well it is not. Try to always succeed on your lowest goals or things you don't know much about. Giving up and not showing just a little bit of work can take you no where in the future. When you get tired of everything and not try again you would never work or study on a job you were thinking about since you were younger. Most likely you'll end up working at a low paying restaurant/job.

Most kids in school want to graduate high school and then join college for a better future. Theres some students who have dropped out of high school just because they dont want do work on papers,fail exams and even important classes, and the most likely reason is because they want to stay home and sleep,and go where ever they want to all day. Parents want there children to succeed but when they fail some try again and go on with life an work at a high paying job and living on their own.

Working hard and giving it your best will give you better life with good education. Once again failure happens to everyone and people learn from their mistakes. People who have achieved their goals have had many failures during the life time. Remember when ever you fail along your life time always try again. You can fail up to ten times or more but you should always have the option to try again for better results.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,6.0

Many people have experienced this before and there are others who have not yet experience it. I agree and there are many reasons why people may try to change their impression. You might find it difficult to change your first impression because you do not know how others will react to you, you do not want people to remember your first impression especially if it was bad, and you do not know how its going to go.

If you worry about how people will react when trying to change your first impression, it will make things more difficult for you to achieve that goal. Take your chances be confident and do what you have to do. There have been times where people can just look at someone and assume the worst about them. They could be going through a rough time and you may not even know that but you still assume the worst. First impressions may be easy and may be hard to change.

First impressions are almost always remembered,that makes it difficult to change your first impression. No matter how many times you try to change your first impression some people will still remember it. First impressions are important because its how people see you. You always want to make it your best not your worst. Think to yourself about what your going to do before you do it, because many people will agree or disagree that first impressions are impossible to change.

Not Knowing how your first impression is going to be is horrifying. On the other hand it can go great you just never know. You may be nervous about how everything will go things may not be so easy to change. You need to focus on the good things that. will make you feel comfortable and confident. Make yourself feel right before you change your first impressions because as you know there either easy or impossible to change.

Some people say the first impressions are easy to change others will say its impossible. People may disagree and agree with this. People who have experienced this know how hard it might have been. Some may seem insecure by their first impression because you do not know how others will react to you, you do not want people to remember your first impression especially if it was bad, and you do not know how everything will go.

Talking to people exampling how do it things step by step, not just setting a good example, being able to allow things to be and teaching new ways to be a good influence is one of the best ways.

As will as being there for people sporting them is setting a good example, because you're are showing them that they do desveras the love and action that you give them and that they are worth everything. setting with them and helping them improve on a skill that you are good at a good example, having them see you work with different things, and working with people that might be spiral is good because you teaching them on how to be a better person. Social media that's the most imporent one because most people use it for everything. By posting something nice or commtening something nice people will be happy, or posting a picture about them or that is related to them will make them happy.

Showing people that there is good people out there and they can be found through everywhere is something else. videos of you showing kindenss in different ways, helping someone older then you. Going out in public giving things away things that people people donating money, or clothes, shoes. Is setting a good example for the younger people out there that are still growing up and the ones that haven't devloped yet. And having schools show this to people to the kids is mostly imporent because kids at a young learn more, so if they see someone helping they will start doing themself.

Helping a mom with her her kids or a new born baby. adults will always try there best to help you and could take there help bacause they are more exprienced with thing they have lived longer and they know better then we do. and things that may help us impover on things that we may find very had to do and can't do it. That shows that people are helping in different ways and show us that we could do this for the peope that are younger then us. But there will be others that might come in your way and try to stop you, but you have to show them that you are better then this and that you can handle everything that comes your way. And that you could without there help on that you are one strong person. people will bring you down and try there best to make you fail but you can not let people do that to you. you have to always keep your head up and don't worry about those people. Let them worry about you. you don't have to sweat a thing you just sit back and relax.

Helping people from other countries and showing around where you live helping them speak a new launge and showing them how to get to get stalled and not having to worry about what am l going to do in this countery with no help be the one to help them with everything. And that it's self is showing how to be a good influnce because whenn they are stlaed they will look and say I had someone that helped now let me help others. By doing the same thing. Helping someone pay for there food because they forgot there money and can not pay and seeing them happy and having them say thank you the as they get there food.

Having someone to help and seeing them happy is one of the best things so setting a good example is good but you have to show more then just that people will always look up to you if you show them a bit more they will be happy for you extied and wanting more for you.

As for the younger people they will look up and say that how nice i want to be and seeing them helping other kids id even more good. They are young and they need to start setting a good gole for themself. As a person you should always try to be a good one because everyone is watching you and they talk. But you could show them your most nice side and a very good side that is camplale of doing things on there own.

At the end of the day it is best to show people more then just setting a good example, they will all the knowge that you gave them into use. ",2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,5.0

272CA21BAE13,"Some parents think that is normal for students to choose a career a young age, but other people think that is most better for students to choose a career when they feel get ready for to take this responsibility. Why is importan taht students to choose a career to young age? Although some say it is good idea for students to commit to a career to young age because the students can to learn more, actualiy it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career to young age because the students don't have time for explore new things and they don't have time for fun in the high school.

Some person belive that is is a good idea for students to commit a career to young age. One reason is because the students can to learn more in a specifit environment.

For example, the students who choice a career by time they enter high school. They have a idea about the class they want to take. For this reason, when they finish high school they are more prepared. A 35% the students choose a career to youn age because they think it is help for your future.

However, it is bad idea for students to commit a career to young age because they don't have the opportunity to explore new things. For example, in the high school the students have the opportunity to choose 2 or 3 elective class. this clas to help the student to find or explore a new hobby,and some time this class to help to discover what do yuo like or what do you want in the future. In my opinion, I think that this class are good for the students who not have a idea what they want to study in the future. For example, I want to learn to play guitar and I take the music class, but I discover I am so bad in this type of class. My second year I take a math class and I discover taht I love math and I think that I want to continue to learn about this class.

The other reason is it is bad idea for students to commit a career to young age because the student don't have time for fun. One reason is that students is only focus his study and they don't pay atention her and his friends. they are worry because they have -B in your class or they don't make the homework. In my pinion, It is good that they are worry for your grade, but they need time to fun because tha teacher and old people think taht is good that students take a breack (rest landing) some times. In my experince, I heva alot of memory with my friends for this reason I recommend all students pay atention your frinds and create a lot of memory like me. But no forget the school and the most importan your family.

In conclution, it is bad idea for students to commit a career to young age because they need to consider what they want to study in the future. In my experience, is most better to take time to fun with frinds, your family and take time think about what do you do in your future.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,6.0
58C6CE6B0BBB,"The majority of the school of the United States has a lot of team for sports or clubs for representing their names any where that they go, the majority of the students who really likes to be in this teams or clubs can be taking extra work for the daily life. The schools should take control over those students who are in extra activities after and during school time, because they may be getting to much work from the activities or may be missing work from their classes for the extra actives from that they are involved to.

The extra work that students have to do for the extra activities that they are involved is strongly hard and painful because they have to experiment it everyday even those who are use to can be hardly because how the human body get tired of the activities do during in the day it needs to rest in fact the student who is in so many activities is getting tired maybe the person is not feeling the fatigue but his or her body will tells in the future. Student who is involved more than one team can be experimenting a lot of work for example if a student is in the soccer team and the band of the school he has to be able to attend all the practice that they have in the different teams if the both teams have the practice at the same time and the same day the student has to decide which practice he has to go and how is gonna be able to catch the advanced that the other club that he is of this issues can be stressful for the student. The travels that the teams make can be very far in late hours such as a presentation in the downtown, the students who is participating in this event is going to come back to home very late which means the students will not have time to study or will not have enough hours to rest. In fact the extra work is affecting the study for the student.

The students who are involved in some many activities in the school, they are experimenting extra experience with a objective such as enrich their academics curriculum for the future that can be short and long term with this terms i want to say that the future be tomorrow or maybe next 2 years of their life. However the student can be very focus on their extras activities that are not related with the school work such as homework and study for their exams, they can be wasting their time paying attention on the activities than they forget do their homework or another examples is that they have a presentation for the school and they have to be there with club or the team representing the school. In fact the students are forgetting or losing their time for they own education.

In conclusion the school should take control over the students who are interesting to be in more than one team or club because they can be affected by the a lot of work that they have to do for the teams, also the school should have in mind what type of the student is interesting to be on theirs teams because some of the students can be deal with a lot activities and still have good grades of their classes. as lastly point the school should take control or what type of the activities the student are involved to.",3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,6.0
DFCF2A3BE972,"The program that the school provides for attending classes online could have a positive outcome or it could have a negative outcome. Different school have different ways of doing things. Some school don't provide this type of programs, in others do. Different type of people have different type of view of attending classes online. People would agree that is a good idea but other would say its bad idea. Having online class you don't have to wait for other people to finish. You could do what pace you want and to do your classes. It could have a negative part to attending online school. Your WIFI could go slow or not work at all. Having a hard time to achieve the work. Not having a different environment with people with the same age. Not doing the work that they assigned you.

When a student have class online they could find it defalcate to achieve the work that they been assigned to. You would not be able to ask question about the problem. Would have to figure it out by your self. Some online website would not help you to achieve what you are looking for. It could give a bad answer and then you got the whole assignment wrong. In videos you could find ways to achieve it but sometimes there is not a lot of videos on things that you are looking for. If you where in a class room you could ask a teacher to show you how to solve it and you would probably would understand it more. In online school sometimes there is no teacher available at the time when you need them. Sometimes student don't have the time and sometimes they don't turn in there work on time. Would just put it to the side and say"" they would probably do it later"" and never do it. It could be found defalcate to achieve the work on time.

When you so round your self with people that are the same age. You could have study patterns and you could ask them for help. Doing online school its just you and the computer and the class you are taking. Probably have friends but they mite not be taking the same class as you,would not be a able to work together or study. Doing online school would maybe not have time to socialize with new people. You may work or do other things but most of the times they could be older or you just don't talk to people a lot. Having different environment could help you to learn more and plus you would not be by your self. Have other people with you in the same room. Not just you home by yourself with a computer. Having classes online you would not be sou round with people your age.

Doing online class sometimes could give out a lot of work to do in one day. In the same day you have to turn it in. It could be challenge when you dont know what they are talking about or you just don't understand it. Doing your work is one important thing to do, to understand the class and what its teaching. Not just going online to find something that kind of looks like the work and you just copy it down. Sometimes student could get lazy and not do there work. Would probably leave it for the last minute to turn it in. The laziness of student could end up with no good grades or passing the class, would take the class all over. You could get distracted really fast with other things that is going on in your life. Not doing the work, it would not take you no where and would not finish the class on time before the due date.

The school would give different ways for student to attend class. It could be online class or going to a classroom in a school. It would be helpful for student to attend more class and probably have more free time. Sometimes student could take advantage on this program to just stay home and do nothing. Life could be hard sometimes and you could go through things that you don't expect to happen. It could be defalcate when you don't know the subject and there is no teacher around to help you. Students always choose whats right for them. Attending classes online could be defalcate to achieve. Would not be sou rand by people their age and probably not do there work. Attending classes online dose not always work out for students.    ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,6.0

96E7F9D0866D,"How to be successful,

""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm''~former Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

I agree with Churchill's statement; when you keep trying and dont give up you, feel even better about accomplishing because you put more time and effort into doing so. If you let failing bring you down, you wont try as hard and wont get all the credit you deserve. Failure helps your success.

You might be asking, ''How would failure help your chances of succeeding?'' well, you will learn from your mistakes and do better. You are given another opportunity to succeed; if you use it correctly you will feel accomplished, if you dont you might feel regret. Many people give up after failing because they're afraid of failing again. Sooner or later they realize they should have tried extra hard the second time around.

An example would be, me. I failed my biology sol the first time so i gave up, after feeling regret i decided to try again. Not only did i pass, I passed with a higher score then needed. Since then I have been trying extra hard even if i fail.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,7.0

Everyday, when we wake up we need to think about today what is plan we need to finished? do not lazy, many people need dream. One reason, If we attitude to think about what is plan need to finished ,we don't feel boring., we feel a lot power.

""your character will be what you yourself choose to make of it. that quote along changed my mindset, many people would disagree with John and his way of thinking but i personal agree with what he wrote,theres a lot of true behind his words, People shouldn't focus about others opinions or let bad experiences or events shape its character. I personal believe characters arent beyond our control after all we are the ones that control our way of thinking and reacting to them. My self has seen my tree closes friends Generic_Name,Generic_Name and Generic_Name ended up really bad after they decide to let bad events,experiences, and opinions shape the way of their characters.

Generic_Name one of my closest friend decided to let one big events shape his character and at the end everything went wrong for my dear friend. When he was a little kid he contently got hit by his parents in he grew up mad and he started using violence at school he would get in trouble all the time and his parents would get super mad and would use violence against him too they say it was to ""teach him a lesson"" everything went like that for him until many years passed and he got married and he contently used violence every time she did something wrong, he was mad about what its parents did to him so he would always hit his wife until one day he end up killing her and himself.

Generic_Name my other close friend let experiences shape his character in a bad way.

when he was a young man falling a love with pretty girls many of those girls just wanted to play with his feelings. Those girls never took him seriously until one day he got tired of the way girls would treat him and he loose feeling and he become just like those girls he didn't like at first. My friend Generic_Name started playing with girls feeling and he end up by him self and never finding true love, one he got true love but bad experiences make him loose feelings for all females and he played the one true love he had.

Generic_Name friend of mine let opinions got the best of him, he was contently trying to be someone he wasn't just so people he love would love him back but at the end he was just hurting him self because he wasn't happy like that he was just lying to himself and acting for other people.

One can just simply type one copy and copy more on the computer and a machine called a printer, the printer can make all the copys you need for you, instead of making the copies yourself and taking you a very long time to make them.

Next, one doesn't have to go anywhere to buy what they want.

One can so it at the confort of one's home.

Like online shopping, it's very helpful, and also online delivery.

Today is so much easier to get the stuff you wanted, exactly as one wants it to be.

Another way of helping is food ordering.

Now all one has to go is get on the app, get the fiid you want and someone will come and deliver it to you at your door steps.

So you don't have to leave your house ever.

Lastly, technology can help us do more, like discovering thing we never knew.

Like some culture and what they do or believe in.

Discovering and knowing about them and their culture can be an amazing experience.

One might even go to that place to get that full experience it, or buy the things that they use.

All this is because of the technology that has help you discover this.

Some people might argue differently.

For example, they might say that being to much time on the technology can waste perecious time away when you can do something productive at that time.

Well if you think about it taht could be another way technology can help us with.

It can help us with time managment.

To manage the time we use and make us more responsibles of what we do with that technology.

In conclustion, there is so many ways that technology can help us with.

Like discovering new cultures, doing things like shopping and ordering food at the confort of our home, and helping us accomplish or complete many task quickly and efficiently.

So what I believe in is that technology has a positive effect on peoples lives.",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,6.0

When ever you ask someone for their opinion about something, you shouldn't expect what they tell you. You should be aware that it might not work and might not go the way you want it to go or the way you expect it to go. Before you do anything tell your self, ok, if this doesn't go right, this is my fault not the person I asked advice for.

Also when you ask a person for advice and it does work, make sure before you ask the person make sure you say thank you because somtimes people just walk away from you pretending your not even there when they know your asking them something. so just know that your thankful for people wanting to listien to you and wounder what you need or what you need information on.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,7.0

A4CD4307D620,"Part of growing in this life is having the right type of mindset and skill you want for yourself only. The things I have learned in today's day is probably not really achievable because people give up to easy and think it's hard to fix cars. I like to build and take apart engines or even add parts to get more potential out of any car I purchase. I love to race cars and also flip my money too. That all takes skill but you don't learn if your not taught in life.

Likewise myself , for 11 years my father taught me how to use his tools and fix little things on any car he had at the moment. We would sell them and flip the money beacuse we'd be the ones fixing them up a bit. When I got my very first car it had no motor in it and bought it for six hundred dollars. I myself bought the motor for a thousand and installed the whole thing by myself but yet with the right tools it was then worth five thousand because of how many miles the engine was and how clean the interior and exterior was. I would always becareful though when it came to turbo the engines. You'd need to hook a special computer on it to tune the compter of the engine so it doesn't blow up on you. I'd love to race and compete against other peoples builds for money on the track. The best part of mastering this skill is that I will never need a mechanic to fix my own car again.

Another skill I have become really good at is gaming and playing the fracnchise called Call of duty. These types of games are shooter games and it all depends on how fast your sensitivity is and how fast you can react to whatever is happening in the game. When it comes to gaming I like to post videos online of how good I am because I can also get paid through how many people watch my videos. Some people like the entertainment but more like to see how fast the reactions I have. That type of skill has helped me so much in life because it has always helped me make the right decsions when I am driving on the road even in school it has helped me remember and react a little faster then others in class. This skill improves everyday because it's affected my everyday life. Through this I've mastered to actually get through everday life without having such stress because I am always prepared to react and decide what is good for me.

All in all I agree with Ralph Waldo he is right without trying something new you won't grow at all. The human brain is mean't to be expanded and stretched like a muscle to learn new things like playing a sport , remembering equations in physics and solving over and over again and still getting logical answers , to be good at something takes practice , but to master whatever you want to master takes brilliance.

One place that I would like to visit is Disneyland. because visiting this place means a new opportunity of making new memories and since everyone loves their childhood memories as much as I do. then whenever you visit Disneyland it could refresh your old memories back.

when I go there I would meet my favorite characters for example ;Mickie mouse, Cinderella, Harry potter ,and Descendants. yet maybe I could also see a show live on the stage or even I could see how the Disney crew make the movies. if I got lucky enough I could even meet my favorite celebrities or favorite singers such as;ArainaGrenda, Sofia Carson ,Dove Cameron,and etc. when I am their I would like to see the designing,parks,and go for a tour.

In the Disneyland I could go watch dolphins dances in the water and maybe also try to play with them or whenever you go inside a tunnel in Disneyland you could see characters of a movies and it feels like you are in a hunted house. maybe when you are in the Disneyland you could also see a movie scene that is new and the Disney crew hasn't published it yet.

As a conclusion, visiting to the Disneyland is a very special way to make new memories. and its a very enjoyable for families to gather around and get more closer. another way is that it makes your dreams come true of meeting your favorite singers,actors,and characters. and I am sure that if you go to Disneyland you won't regret it.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,6.0
AA1ED5376761,"Success is said to be hard with a negative attitude, but why should attitude define the destiny of a person? Life is full of surprises but with a good attitude you can overcome just about anything. A great attitude isn't obtained by many but it certainly isn't hard to get. All success in life leads back great attitude and awesome mentality. The Key to success is to have a positive attitude and mind set because the person with a positive attitude will gain a healthier life style, a better career, and money.

Positive attitude comes from a good mentality and when people have that they see life differently. People who have this characteristic usually don't stress as much because they change the negative to positive. They have patience and don't get irritated so easily or in other words they are unbothered by others. Giving up is never an option especially if it deals with something they love or a dream they have. Since they do not stress as much, don't let others get under their skin, and rarely give up they live healthier and happier.

Careers are a perfect example of the power of good attitude; If a doctor goes into work saying ""I'm not smart enough for this job."" Is it possible that his way of thinking limits the way he works? it may, because he will go on with his day giving 50 percent when he needs to give 100 percent. If he would've change the way he thought maybe to ""if i wasn't smart enough for this job i wouldn't have gone this far."" Now he would be giving 100 percent instead of 50 percent. Since he is giving 100 percent all the time it will make him stand out since he is not just another employee. Employers might just move him up to something more important or give him a raise.

Money is something worked and sweated for, and for those who have to work ten times harder than others generally fix their mentality and attitude. If achieving a goal in life is so hard, then why did most High school drop outs become something great? Not all but the ones who did succeed in life they were determined and had a positive attitude about struggles they encountered. Money is all over the place it just takes the right mind set and attitude to get it. Although money doesn't give you eternal happiness a good attitude will.

Attitude may not fix all of your problems but it sure does give your life a different route. Great minds all have something in common their mind set and attitude. Great attitude takes in life and makes them better. There are many keys in life there is one made for success and that's attitude. Three things that are there once you open the door is a better life style, better opportunities, and more money.  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.0,8.0

On the other hand , some will disagree by saying that if students dont attend actual school they will become lazy and irresponsible. Distance learning will benefit many student and also school.

Distance learning will benefit students in many ways such as better attendance . If students are allowed to attend school while at home it will give them less chances of not attending. Something that students hate most is waking up in the morning to get ready for school. Having to wake up so early in the morning just to attend school for about eight hours will cause a student to become lazy and tired.

Unfortunately some student are born or are diagnosed a certain disability to where they cant attend school . However those students with disabilities have a right to have an education. Distance learning will really benefit those students by allowing them to attend school from home. There are many reasons why students benefit from distance learning but being able to help a child with a disability on their education is the most important reason.

If students dont attend their actual school there will be less problems. Some students are treated really bad in school , many are bullied , and also many like to be drama queens . However if students attend school at home it will benefit a child because they wont have to see other students and there will be less drama and more education. Schools will stop having so many bullying problems.

On the other hand many will disagree and say that if students stay at home and pursue their education there they will become irresponsible and lazy.

I agree with the idea of establishing homework club in my school for many reasons. One of the reasons is becasue that has many benefits for me and other students in the school. Also, it will make our country become better, and it saves lots of time for students.

One of the reasons I agree with the idea of establishing homework club in my school is because it has many benefits for students. Firstly, it will help a lot of students to get good grades on their test, classwork, homework,.... and that will make them feel happy and love school even more. It is not only make them happy, it also makes their parents happy becasue we are like the treasures of our parents, so if we are happy, our parents will be happy, too. Secondly, students can directly talk to their friends while they are working on their homework. Students also can stay afterschool and discuss about their project if needed. Lastly, students can get help by the teachers whenever they need. To summarize, homework clubs are very helpful for students because that helps students to get good grades, studnets can directly talk to their friends while they are working on their homework, and they can get help by teachers if needed.

While establishing afterschool homework club has many benifits for students, it is also better for the future of the United States. It is better for the future of the United States because the amount of people will get good job would be increased, so the U.S. will get more money. One of the character in the movie I watched before said, "" Your future is based on what you did in the past,"" so if we study well right now, we will get a good job in the future, and that alo helps our country to become better. Another reason is because the number of good grade students in our country will be increased. Lastly, when we talk about America, everyone will think about the land of opportunities. Overall, establishing afterschool homework club will be better for our country because more people will get good job in the future, number of good grade students in the country will be increased, make us proud of our country.

Although establishing afterschool homework club is better for the future of the United States, it also saves students a lot of time. One of the reasons for that is because students can finish their homework early, so when they get home, they don't have to do anything. Next, after school, they can enjoy the rest of the day with their family or they can do whatever they want. Best reason for that is becasue they can join some outside activities, and that will keep students stay healthy, stronger, and don't get tired during school. So, establishing afterschool homework club will save students a lot of time becasue they can finish their homework early at school, they will have more time to enjoy with their family, and that will keep students stay healthy.

Many students say that establishing afterschool club has many disadvantages, but they are wrong. I agree with the idea of establishing homework club in my school because there are many benefits for students who have difficulty in certain subjects, or who want to finsh their homework ealry. Next, it is better for our country, and it also saves a lot of time for students. Afterschool homework club will be best friend of many students, including me.

Now that has new appearances to make much something with the technology, they do not like sometimes to have that go out of the house or where they're go. The people now with the technology more advance they only like do everything alone.

I to advice to the peoples that have more opportunities for sharing also the another peoples, because not only everything is the technology. The people that only use this don't have a perfect life.

No sharing much times with the family, also can be addictive to this. They don't see that these ones to get lost the opportunity of can have one life style better. To love and sharing with the people that have good examples in the life. The technology is good in much occasion, but not to do something to excess of the time. Is better for the life is you have a control of can have new ideas and knowledge.

Also be positive with this is to know that only the people that only want to use this is for something that more like the technology than pass time with the humas, because maybe not have good benefit for the life too.

Before that the technology affect to the life's peoples, they was so different and had different life.

Now is more diferent, only pass time in this and don't like pass time with the peoples.

I would like to recommend that only use for good benefits in the life. I would like to say that in my experience is more easy when i use the technology, i only use for my benefit; for example when i work i use my computer and my telephone, is good idea use for this. Also no everything is bad with this, i buy my clothes and shoes thanks to the technology.

0BEB8F7F5A64,"First impression are very important when you first meet someone. Many people say first impressions are almost impossible to change, but i strongly disagree with that. Majority of the time when we meet someone we already think of them in a certain way, but our judgment could always be wrong. Thats why i believe first impressions could always change.

I believe that first impressions can change the way people think of you. Sometimes people can be irritable or just in a really bad mood because something is occurring in their lives, but in reality that's not how they really are. One reason first impressions can be wrong, is because maybe they didn't get enough sleep at night, and they have to get up early to go to work, or school in the morning. For example, i am not much of a morning person, so when i wake up in the mornings i can be rude, and people might not want to talk to me, but if you see me later in the afternoon i will be smiling, and laughing. Another reason first impressions could be wrong, is because they might not feel comfortable with the people who they are surrounded by, and be very shy, but once you start talking to them they change. For example, my best friend and i used to hate each other. I used to think she was annoying, and rude, and i am guessing she thought the same for me. One day we both started to talk to each other, and i found out we have many things in common, and that we are like the same people. That same day we became the best of friends, now we are basically like sisters. This is why i think that first impressions can always change.

In conclusion, i believe that from now on as we move forwards in life we shouldn't assume what the other person is like, and not to always rely on first impressions because they could always be wrong.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,8.0
29DCC61428C0,"In the beginning of the quote, Thomas Jefferson points out of a sensible fact about being inactive and being active. I personally believe , it is important to always do something by doing so ,you will eventually accomplish something. Occasionally by the things that you do you might possibly don't get anything in return . For instant for example you Will probably feel satisfied by doing something good even if you do not accomplish anything at the end of the day .

First and foremost ,Thomas Jefferson himself was a hard working man , which is why he will always be remembered for what he accomplished for his people. On the other hand ,what could possibly happen if you are doing ? For instant , the Scientist Edward Jenner ,who discovered cow pox vaccine , thanks to him he helped our ancestors survive during that time by combining cow pox to human cowpox . My point no matter how small it is what you do , it is considered in accomplishment.Inactivity only serve a purpose when there is nothing you can do about , not a single thing , but it is always important to do the best you can .It is definitely the safest option to stay inactive,which is why an inactive person called colored in human society.

In my opinion , if you ask any quote writer weather the quote come from their experience , where they in a position when they had to do the same thing ? answer would be yes , Thomas wrote this quote because he used to be in a position where he had to pick either being active or being idle ? he clearly made his choice

Clearly he made his choice. Ironically he wrote a quote about it .Additionally ,the ones who are idle usually follow their brain instead of their heart and the ones who are always doing is the other way around . Likewise it is only a matter of time , once you accomplish something a doing something , you will start to regret for those golden times that you did nothing .

I believe , there won't be any future with out an accomplishment, you can build your future by putting in works ,later on ,there will not be any regrets .Likewise if you accomplish something , everyone will start looking up to you especially your children .Just like you looked up to someone or something , and that person changed your mind . Or you looked look up to something ,what i really mean by something i mean money and luxuries. The reason why Thomas didn't suggest to be idle was because of the fact , he used to be someone idle later one he must have come to a conclusion or in a place , being idle did not really work out for him .

In my suggestion ,you can convince others to do the same ,this will even add more to your doings . it is most likely a chain in a point of view . If you take a few moments and think about Thomas Jefferson's quote you start to become a different person . Doing something it is always better than doing nothing .I would primarily Start from a scratch and find a beneficial career .You can not start a career by being an absolute idle. There are many individuals who are living in their parents home unemployed with no educations . There reason why there is school is because young children can work on their on by the time they grow older .Even if you are disabled you will still have to accomplish something .Kids and teenagers only job is to go to school , when their in school they must accomplish something .

In conclusion , most kids become idle due to personal reasons and due to the condition that they live in .the can not keep on going , they must start putting in work by doing at least their home work . The reason why i brought up is because this particular issue is very common days . For instant if you a bucket and if you throw a quarter inside the quarter every day at the end of the year you will have plenty of money made inside the bucket .    ",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,6.0
1A8A994EBFDA,"Students' courses about career

Nowadays, there is a heated debate over whether it's a good idea that students select courses which are related to their future career. As far as I'm concerned, I think students should select courses of study in school which will guide them toward a specific career.

First of all, students who select couses that are related to career will have much more time to prepare future career. As an old saying goes:'Practice makes perfect'. Students will be able to study during high school for 3 years and it's such a long time for students to improve themselves gragually. With a sufficient preparation, students will learn about their career deeply. It's a good choice for students to build their own career goals and make it come true with enthusiasm heart.

Second, students select course about career will lay a solid foundation in academy study. It is benefial for students to set their foot on professional knowledge field. Also, Students can receive the knowledge what they want, and it has impact on their future will encourage them to study with passion. They may think it will feed them back in the future. Moreover, it helps students to be more competitive in applying college since the high school courses maybe connected to college couses.

Third, it hepls students build their characters. Students can have a better understanding of society and build a sense of responsilibity during the study of career. In this view, when students are working in a company, they will have a nice behavior and apply all the knowledge they learned into the project. It's also good for country's economic, the talent people will improve the development of society.

However, some people think that select the courses which are related to career will limit the students' future goals and hobbies. Even though this, selecting courses which are related to career also have many advantages. For instance, students can imrove their ability to behave professional in the future, country need talent people to run the ecomomic, college will accept the students who are good at major and so on. As the considering of students may change their mind, I recommand parents and teachers give students avaliable advice before selecting courses. It will help students to identify themselves. In addition, with their helps, students also need to considerate their future carefully since it may determines who they are going to be.

To put it in a nutshell, to select courses which are related to career is benefial for the development of students' future. It's like a lighthouse which lead students to a reliable path. ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,7.0
E2FC7B4466C5,"Do you want to know how a science could be enjoyable? Tune in and you'll find out. I think that a science experiment could be enjoyable because you can learn new things with your friends,you can work on the experiment with you friends,and you can talk to other people about what you got or learned

First,i think that science experiments could be enjoyable because you can learn new things with your friends. Sometimes your friends won't figure out things as fast as you or they might not figure it out,so you can explain to them how you figured it out and maybe they figured out something you havent yet so they might teach you about what they got to. Later on in the school year you might be asked on a test or quiz about the thing that you learned. When you get home and your parents ask you what you learned you can tell them and explain it to them.

Second,i think that science experiments could be enjoyable because you can do the science experiment with your friends. If you do it with your friends you can have fun. You could have time to talk to them about the science experiment that your doing, Also you could work together on it and get a good grade.

Lastly,i think that science experiment could be enjoyable because you can talk to other people outside of your group about what you got and learned. Lets say that you went to another group to see what they figured out and they tell you something you dont agree with,so you could explain to him or her about what you got and how you got it and then you can ask the teacher and figure out who was wrong. You can learn from what they got and add it to your work.

I think that a science experiment could be enjoyable because you can learn new things with your friends,you can work on the experiment with you friends,and you can talk to other people outside of your group about what you got or learned. Thats why i think that a science experiment can be enjoyable,so you can learn and have fun at the same time!         ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,6.0
8B9EEF86DD66,"Dear Principal,

I just want to let you know my opinion about not letting student who have less than a C in their grades participate in any of the activities. I think that it is right that you do that rule in our school because if you do, it might help the students understand that it is really important that they have good grades.

This may help the students but not only them it might help the teachers to. I think this because it will help the teacher because they will have more interest in teaching us the students because they will know that we may attention and not that we just play around in class. It will help the students because they will know that if they try hard to bring their grades up they will be able to participate in the activities.

So, I really think this will help us so that we may attention more to our grades. I think that this is important because I personally think that my grades are important to me and to my family. I think that yes you should do this rule that if you don't have more than a C you don't get to participate in any of the school activities that we have.

9AC838864995,"Im talking about if the school days should be extended by one and a half hours or not and the effects it'll have towards the students, teachers, and the whole school together.

So adding an hour and a half to a school can open a lot of opportunities to learn, more electives, and what most students would think of a longer day at school is bordem, but school is where you socialize the most during the day and as a kid school is where you meet most of your long time friends so there is more then just being bored at school it's a place you can socialize, have fun, and learn all in one day.

If it were up to me whether to leave the school schedule as it is or to add an hour and half to the school day I would have to disagree because if the teachers were to give piles of homework then when you get home you'd be exhausted and drained to the point where you arent able to then even if you did manage to then you would be so tired that it would effect the next day which would cause you to barely do any work in school so the students need to get out of school so they can get their homework done.

If students were to stay at school till 4pm assuming there bedtime is around 9pm then the would basically only have 5 hours to do their homework but wait so then imagine if they had chores to do around the house then once they've done their chores they'd be even more exhausted so after all that they had done what if they wanted to relax a little bit now they have such little time to do anything during their time off from school that they might have to stay up longer then they usually do now it's about 6am in the morning after last night they could barely get a goods night rest and their body and mind are completely drained for today and all they have is good breakfast to get their mind to at least keep them knowledgeable for the day and this whole cycle repeats over and over but then you can at least get a good weekend of relaxing so that you'll be refreshed for the weekdays.

I disagree with the decision to extend the school day because of the effects that it has towards students and how it can effect their mind and how much productivity they are able to produce could be affected due to overwhelming amount of work put upon a child. There are definitely many pros to having a good education and to be able to live a good life. Students may not want to go to school and can find it very overwhelming but at the same time the students are working very hard so they can have the best possible life they can. School is a place where you go to learn, have fun, and the school has provided the time so that students can learn what they want by having electives that they like the best because that what they might want to be when they grow up because if the school didn't have such excellent teachers the students could never succeed on their own and that's why the teachers have to relate to the student so they can have a much better understanding so that they can proceed to adulthood where their decisions can affect them badly.

51C93A7260DE,"Have you ever thought what school would be like for you and other, students in your school would have a program where older and younger kids will gather around, do different activities and projects and learn at the same time.

Think about programs you will want to be included in your school,that will help you learn faster and make you understand things better and differently,you will also get help and subjects you have struggles on a daily bases. In my opinion i feel like students feel more better and cofterble talking to students there age just because it might be easy for them to explain things better to someone who is the same age. There's times where student's feel more pressured by an adult so that's what makes them not want to ask for help.

Now think to yourself and ask yourself if you find it better, having a program where all students can gather around just to ask for help when is needed and so socializes with them. Because theirs always time you get to school and talk to your everyday friends but you dont really know theres other people you havent met yet so making a program for everyone is a good way to get to know others in the program.

So with all that being said if you want to have a program at your school, that will help you and other student's gather around and bond together like friends and get to know everyone in your school. Is not just in the program that will be in your school but people that you walk by every other day gather around and teach everyone something new and they can give back to you and teach you something new everyday to anyone in the program.

But back to the main starting point of the paragraph if you want to start a new program at your school talk to one of your teachers or your principle and share the ideas you have thought of or the ideas you have in mind and gather around to start something new and make school a better place.

8EF1139A2B72,"Why should you agree on telling the truth? Honesty may hurt people fellings but what is true is true . And sometimes is good to tell a lie but not all the time. Honesty means not lying, telling the truth, and having confidence on what are you going to say to that person.

Honesty means not lying. You should always tell the truth to that person that you are telling to. Because if you lie to someone then you will have to pay the cosquences that you have done to that person. I mean it's good to tell once a lie but if you repeat with that process on lying to people it's not going to take you to a good path. And that person will not talk to you or even do worst stuffs will come to your way. It may depend on what lie you did to that person.

Another reason is on telling the truth. Because if you tell the truth you will get out of so many problems from people. And yes, people may get in their fellings but what is true is true you can't lie to that truth. If you make up a lie to someone they will belive on what you said and then tell that person that said that if it's true on what the sid and if it's not true than problems will come to your way.

And they last reason is being confident with the person you are going to tell the truth or lie. Because people these day they will tell the secrets about you, that you told to that person and start so many problems and dramas about you. And then you will face so may problems. You should always be confident on what you are going to say to that person because then it's going to be to late. And if you lie the same thing will happen to you you will face your own problems.

So that why I tell you that you should alway tell the truth to that person no matter what if they get in their feeling but what is true will always stay true no matter what. And as I said it good to tell a lie once but if you continue telling lie than I'm sorry for you because now you are going to face your own conquences that you have done.

75D9A995F00C,"Some societies thinks that students should identify a career before entering high school, and should take courses that will guide them toward a specific career, but it's a good idea for students to commit themselves to a specific career at such as young age?. Taking courses in high schools that will guide students to a specific career is not a good idea because this will not help students to discover others things that they are good at and can be stressful.

During high school time students are not old enough to make a important decision, they should be taking interesting courses, and discover their essence.

It's essential for students to discover what they like to do, who they want to be, and what they want to study.

Making students to identify a career before entering high school could not help them to discover those things. Some people are already in their freshman year in college, and they don't even know what they want to study because knowing what you want to study in the future is tough and one of the most important decisions students will ever make in their life, and if they are not mature enough they could make the wrong decision and then regret.

When students enter high school i'ts important for them to take courses that they really enjoy.

It's true that taking courses that will guide them toward graduation are important because this courses will prepare them for the future and help them choose the right career. Taking courses that they are very passionate about is way more important because they don't know if while taking one of the courses that they really enjoy taking, they discover what they want to study. For example maybe a student is in a dance class, and he realize that dancing is what he really enjoy doing, and that is what he wants to study.

Choosing a career before entering high school can be stressful because it's a important decision. They cannot just say "" I want to study this career"", if they are not sure about it. Students should take time to choose the right career, and they should be very careful when taking the decision.

In conclusion should not commit themselves to a specific career at a young age because it can be stressful, and they are not mature enough to decide what they want to study. Also students should not take courses that will guide them toward graduation without taking courses that they love and enjoy taking.    ",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,7.0

This change is a good idea, I'am certain this action was taken to awareness as students to eat healthier also to build a efficient body .

Eating healthier will make people aware of the fact that they must change their meats and life routine, Also it encourages them to practice sports as the athletes students and at some point they will prefer so much to take care of their health by dieting, being familiar with the vegetables, fruits, and milk.

F6AA88DC9ACA,"Although it may seen that ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" it actually right. But having something that you master it doesn't mean that trying something new you would failed. But giving up it's what would cost you to never grow, for example changing your life style by eating right and going to the gym is not going to be easy but you still going to give it a try. The reason why is that we want to challenge our self in a new environment that we never thought our self would be challenge our self in. Another reason would be that trying something new mean that we are looking for something that we would enjoy or like.

For example we teach our self how to cook but we know that we never knew how to cook but that doesn't mean we are not going to give it a try. That why we try new things because we want to challenge our self in a situation that we never knew that we could solve it or give up. Another reason is that we love trying new things because we are curious if we can master it another example would be is raising a kid wondering if we got everything and teaching them what is right and what is wrong. That what we love trying new things to see if we can do it or not. That what is more important trying new things and see if we can master it because we are capable of doing thing not a computer can't do and that it trying to learn new things.

We can master anything in our way because we are willing to find out if we can do this, if can not fear it, if we got this, give our self ideas that anything we do it possible when we put our mind it nothing can't stop us. For example we got our freedom from England long time ago, we ended slaves, and we ended racism which was big in the United State. Those are the reason why we can master things even if they are hard to master but we do it for a reason, and the reason is that we love to try new things even is bad but every challenge we are giving, we master them. But there is no dough we would failed those challenge that the world has giving us. Mastering is a challenge that is difficult because there is in our lifetime were we give up and we don't want it anymore. Were our mind and our body just doesn't want it, doesn't keep trying, at some point we start calling our selves looser, quitter.

We bring ourselves down because that how we punish ourselves without physical pain but emotion pain. In our life time that we have live in this earth the most pain that brought us down was emotional pain when we give up in life and we haven't master it. That is the big challenge that we haven't try to complete because it has beating us since the beginning that we are born we haven't control our emotion and that is the challenge that we haven't master it.

For that we have issues that we aren't able to figure it out because it's hard for us to figure what make us mad ,sad, happy, but people who has master it because they did give it a try and they successfully master that does emotions that give us hard time in life. Those people are therapy who want to understand does type emotion because they want to help those people who doesn't understand why they react like that.

B3B5064A7BA9,"How will school programs get older kids assist younger kids?

School programs are making older kids go to elementray school to help younger kids. Teachers these days think older kids from middle school or high school should help the young ones out. Ways older kids can help out the younger kids is by giving them information about their future carrer, maybe help out on a subject the are having trouble on, and they can also talk about college and saving up for it.

Kids in elementray schools wonder what they want to be when they grow up. Maybe they'll like to be a laywer, cop, firefighter, or maybe a doctor. Maybe a college student that is planning to be a doctor can help out to the students that are planning to be a doctor. Older kids can help out about their future carrer and plans about college.

Younger kids are always having trouble in at least oen subject and it should be fine for a older kid to help them out. Older kids may know a lot more than younger kids, but thats always not true. Younger kids can know a lot more than older kids because the younger kids maybe study more. Older kids know more than younger kids because what the older kids learn is more advanced than the kids in elementray. There is always a smart kid in middle school,high school, or college that can always help out any kid.

KIds in elementray school or middle school are already planning about going to college or not. Teens from college can give them advice on how to save up some money or even suggest the cheapest college to go to. Many colleges maybe very very far away from you, so you have no other chance and leave your parents house. Colleges cost thousands of dollars and may taske a while to get all that moeny. Thats why teens from colleges are telling from middle schoo lto start saving up their money for college.

Older kids helping out the young ones is really good and should always be done so the kids can have an idea of what they want. Younger kids will like to know more by learning from the older kids and plan about their future.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0
CD4135EAFB1E,"A Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow. Some will said you'll grow but won't reach their beyond what they mastered. Some will disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson statement, because doing something beyond that already master will never stop you from doing it. In the pass year I played a Villain before I reach goal becoming beyond with a instrument that I didn't know how to play, I master how to soccer for the first when I was little, and at the end of the day your going to be beyond great when you don't give up.

When I was 6th grade in middle school I never though I was going to learn how to play instrument for the first time in my life. The instrument that I'm now play is Villain my brother though I wasn't good enough to play a instrument. I practice every days to get better and to try my best. I played three year in middle school I was getting good and then I love how sound made with bows and string. The teacher once said if stop playing then your going to forget the string note and how to used correctly. When I got to middle I learned how to play a interment for the for time in my life become beyond. I didn't stop growing I kept growing to become better to play.

Why won't we reach our goal then become beyond because doing something beyond your reaching a goal to finish. This was a time where I want to learn how to play a sport. When I was little I wanted to play soccer but I didn't started learning until I was 10 years old. My goal was to learn how to play soccer, until one day I was at the park with my family and friend I learn how to play soccer. My uncle tough me how to played soccer for the first time.

He showed me how to kick the inside and outside of my feet. My uncle told me that I was fast learner that I kicked correctly with forced. So we played soccer just kicking back and forth until knew how to kick. When I was 7th grade I sign up for the girl soccer team for the school. When I made the team I was exacted because I never though I going play for school soccer team and it was the first to play. The couch liked how I played but my friend though I was beyond great but I didn't believe them. When I got to 8th grade I wanted to sign up again because some of my friend was joining, then when I made in the team next then I know they voted for me to become captain for the girl soccer team. The coach was beyond how I played for the game I made 8 goal in the season but I never stopped playing soccer. Until the moment in my life I knew that I had master my goal.

I'm 16 year old about to turn seventeen in July I have reach so many goals in my life and then it when beyond. I learn so many thing on my own because my parent didn't know English. At the end of day I had teacher and friends that help me all my school year. The one key that my parent tough me was never give up on yourself, if you don't understand the problem then go to the next problem then come back to finish the rest. So all this year I learn how to play a instrument that was a villain and playing a sport that love I become beyond great and master to become better. I grew up become better the thing I love the most and did it because I had sibling following my foot step since I was the oldest in my family.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,6.0
1DB195AA7BE3,"Well the best option for my is what you attend the classes from home by way of online .

My reason or my thought is, what you cant learn, in online classes, and thought what you can do it , doing others wor,k in you free time, and the school has good ideas for student what take, classes like after school just in home . So in my position is that because if you work so is you cant take the class for one hours, and you work ,and is more benefit for myself but ,each person has diferent ideas .

Examples:

If you not have work is more time for you ,for what you keep doing you class online.

If you wnat the class . you has more time for to think best for work online and make a good work and your class.

With this examples are much more for what you take any option or my option what is the best or most better already is in you home .

If you not have time like time complete is for that what you take this option ya what has work and not time like for stay in the school all the time .

Others examples is whent you have 18 year old has to much resposabilities and others case it 's not easy .

I think whent a teacher said you need that class is for one reason, and you nedd take that class but you cant took with you teacher what, is most better for you. So and my opinion or my position is take class from home in online, and to much better what ,take video coferencing.

One reason because im take that option is because in my home is relax, and with food and alone and not voices and nothing, and in my home take my time for think most better i think is the most important for my work in home and i think what the work in online is not easy so need my time for to think, and good ideas and good answer, and the idea is what you learn with any option you take for this case . The student in this time has more option for any problem . One reason for what i take this option is for the time ya what much student are major or not have much time for coming a school because the work or others case. Other reasons what the student take this option is beacuse is home not in other pleace ya what not has ride or cars for take that class or classes en other pleace .

My intentions is what others student take this option what is classes from HOME because is the best ,option for any case too if you want free time is more easy for you take this class or classes home by way of online, and is more choice that idea and minus dificult just what in home or online you not have teacher for explain any question so for that reason is little complicate but not impossible make you work so you cant do it , forever you want , nothing is this life is impossible but too not is easy everthing is sacrifice. Abd you has see you work good and past the class sin difucult .

My reference is the option class

FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE. Is the best option and more benefif for learn in home, and more easy for the time or others problem and i cant wait what everthing stay good for my cass or classes .

8D1CD79C0F8D,"Thomas Jefferson once said ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. I was so successful in life. You want to know why? it was because I was always keeping myself busy with work. We accomplish more if we are always doing something because you get more work done, you can be more successful, and you can be more healthy.

First, you get more work done, for example I had a science project due in one month and I decided to get working on it until I had finished it, consequently I had more time to work on my other school work. My friend, Generic_Name she is always working at McDonalds and she never takes any days off. She refuses to stay home and be lazy, therefore you will always see her working on something productive. It could be school work, her job, or anything else that benefits her. Generic_Name had a book project to do and since she was always working she accomplished more than her friend, Generic_Name.

Secondly, you can be more successful, for example my cousin, Generic_Name was always exploring with cars until he found out he wanted mechanic to be his major. Since he knows a lot about cars he can always help people when their cars break down and can also make money that way. Generic_Name can later on open his own mechanic shop in the future. My friend, Generic_Name has also been very successful. She absolutely loves doing makeup on her and on other people. Generic_Name's makeup looks are so amazing she has become a famous makeup artist. I also became successful when I opened up my baleada shop. Every one loved the taste of my homemade tortillas filled with beans, eggs, avocado, and cheese.

Finally, you can be more healthy, for example I go out to run each morning instead of sleeping in. Running outside in the morning can be very healthy because you are stretching your muscles to start the day. Although some people may think inactivity serves a purpose, they are incorrect because inactivity can be unhealthy. My friend, Generic_Name got in shape because he goes to Golds Gym every day after work. He rather go to the gym on his free days instead of staying home watching Naruto because that will not benefit him.

You can get more work done, you can be more successful, and you can be more healthy when you accomplish more if you are always doing something. Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and I benefited from always doing something productive instead of being inactive. Help me spread the word that always doing something is more beneficial and healthy than being inactive.",3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,6.0
0B72A4344B3E,"To make a successful personality from ourselves; We should always accomplish new things, otherwise inactivity cant serve our purpose. Many people think that, behind of every success is your hard wroking, and also achievment without hardworking is impossible. In my opinion inactive people are not have a good future. So they should always do something new to be able to accomplish because, to have a bright future, always successful in our life and being a good personality in our community.

Every people wants to have their best future and wants to have their best life, all of these things comes by how you put yourself in a hard time. It is obvious that without nothing anything we not gonna accomplish. Accomplishment is always comes by how hard work you do. Inactive person do not have a bright future. Inactivity makes people tired of their life because they dont have any plan for their future, they just live for no idea, with no hopes. So it is better to think about our future and build our future from now.

Being successful in our life is what everyone want. Every body want they way to find they key of success. But the person who get successed, they actually did accomplish new things. They things that makes our future bright and that we can have a good life and carrer is to work hard, focus on one main thing that make our carrier and believe in ourselves which has the important view in our life. Being inactive person is really useless in our community. We cannot be anything in our future if we be inactive.

Obviously everybody choose to have a good personality in their community. Having a good personality makes everyones to proud on you. To accomplish a good personality we should makes our thoughts and education higher. Without having a main goal in our life we cannot achieve our aim. Education is the only way for success so by having a good education and carrer we have more attach with our community and we get respect from our community. Inactivity is not the way that we can accomplish more. I think inactivity does not serve a purpose it just makes your brain stop so you could not be able to accomplish.

People should always try their best to make their life easier and it is become by hard work. People who has inactive in their life they will hurt in the future. Successful people always did something before in their life so now the successful in they have a comfort future. The reason behind accomplishment is hardworking, believe in ourselves and look forward for our goal which inactive people do not believe on this.

We must learn about different things other than what we already know to gain knowledge and experience. People that have dreams and want to accomplish should work on trying new experience, learning new things, and improving themselves.

Trying new things is the key to gain experience. Soccer players do not always play only soccer. For example, they try different sports to learn more about them. Teachers always try to come up with new topics to teach their students and help them gain more knowledge. Buisnessman always work on improving their buisness to grow and become better. To gain more experience we should try different things.

To learn things we never knew about we should work hard. Soccer player work really hard to become the best. They do that by learning new skills from big players. Also, teachers try to learn new languages to be able to teach their students who does not speak English very well. Kids should learn from their parents the good things so when they grow up they would have a lot of experience that they learned. We must learn new things to become successful.

We must improve ourselves to become successful. Bodybuilders always work on improving their body and getting big. However, parents try to improve, and change the way they treat their kids with to be able to teach them good things. People that just moved to the U.S.A should work on improving their English to be able to talk with everyone. To become successful we should improve ourselves.

In order to accomplish our dreams we should work on trying new things, learn things we never knew about, and improving ourselves. Engneers try to come up with new ideas to build better buildings. People that travel a lot always learn new languages depending on what country their visiting. Athletics try different sports to improve themselves.

070D792C65B7,"One thing I would like to accomplish in the future is to live in a big mansion in California. Because I've never lived in some type of big house, It will show all the hard work that payed off to get the house, and it will also be the first time I go to California

One thing I would like to accomplish in the future is to live in a big mansion in California. Because I've never lived in some type of big house before. Since I've been born I've been living in small places with other little house nearby like town houses or apartments and for me It has me thinking. ""Why am I living in these places like I have some friends who live in houses but I don't?"" But that was me when I was like little but now I know that some parents aren't as lucky as others and they struggle to find nice places to live in but they get what they can get and at least they get somewhere to live in and give their kids what they need and want so for me It's going to be hard finding a job with good paying money but if i get a degree in something I want to do then It would be amazing to do that.

Another reason I would like to live in a big mansion is that It will show how rich I am and It was hard trying to buy a Mansion. Mansions these days cost so much money (of course because they are big in space and some are in private places) you can find mansions in Florida, Texas, Nevada, California, and etc. But mainly I would love to get one in California. California is a big wealthy state with many great known cities and history. It is mostly visited in the summer for its hot temperatures and great attractions. One city I would love to buy my mansion is maybe in Calabasses or Hollywood, There are many cities to get a mansion it just depends on how much it costs and how big it is on the inside and out.

Last reason I would like to live in a big mansion is that it would be my first time going to California. My mom used to live in California, in a small city near Downtown Los Angeles called Generic_City. She moved from Generic_City to California when she was fourteen (which is my age currently) and she went to high school in Generic_City and learned English there and had a job. but then after finishing one year of college she moved to Virginia and had me when she was around twenty-five. But ever since then she has been telling me stories of how it was for her in California and what places she would visit over there like Disneyland, the Hollywood sign, sporting events, and more places. I would like to visit San Francisco with one of it's famous attraction the Golden Gate Bridge or Go down to Venice Beach and enjoy the beautiful ocean and it's hot temperature to cool off.

And those were my three reasons of why I want to live in a big mansion in California because I've never lived in some type of big house with no houses that are connected together, It will show all the hard work that payed off o get the house, and It will be my first time going to California.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,8.0
15912A718F26,"I agree with the principle, because I think that kids should be active. Kids born in like 2003-2007 stay in all day with a phone in there hand, sometimes they forget to eat because they are to busy watching other peoples lives through a screen when they can do the same thing by going out side. I also think that kids should participate in after school programs because it opens up their young mind to different things like photography some people may not like photography till they try it out and if they try it and like it they like it they stay but if they are not interested they can try some thing else.

Personally I like my schools after school program because next year I'll Be a freshman in high school and I want to play football and my school has a program that you go to to lift weight. But they don't let join then lift you have to go through some kind of training where you have to do four week of training to touch a weight because they want you to be safe they don't want you to get hurt and not play football next year. Something that is Special about this club it's run by the high school coaches who are also gym teacher here at my school. My school also has a basketball team we play a school in Generic_City named Generic_School. My school Generic_School And Generic_School have a little rivalry. But My schools basketball team has tryout so they can get the best kids that my schools has so we can beat Generic_School. Really I think my school made a basketball team to let the kids have fun.

I also think other schools need after school programs because some schools are placed in a bad area and the might live in bad areas with guns, gangs, and violence, but if they make an after school program and encourage kids to go you'll be pulling them from all the violence or joining a gang and doing drugs. Some kids have had to move schools and house just so their child does not become a gang member. I know some people who have ha to move because they lived in a bad neighborhood and their mom and dad pulled them out of school to come to a better school. I thin the principal is just helping the kids enjoy school more and is also helping them stay out of trouble.

In conclusion, I think the principle is right because I think the principle is just trying to make school fun for kids and help the kids stay active. Therefore i agree with the principals decision to make an after school program.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,6.0

Problems make your brain to grow up, imagine being on a math test and you don't know the answer, probably you will be scared but if you try hard to remember what is the answer you will find it, usually problems are too hard to solve and this fact helps you to make your brain to think a way to solve the problems, this can cause your brain to grow up by using all your energy to think in what you can do in this situation.

Problems gives you knowledge, there should be a reason for you to be in a problem, if you fight in the school or anywhere with another person or you do something bad, probably someone will call you to the office or take you to the police department , if you are in a problem the first thing you will do is think on why this happened and this helps you because you will know what you did bad and will not do it again.

Problems makes your personality stronger, if you crash your car you may feel bad and scared for this event, I had a test that it was hard and in that moment I felt bad, so most of the time when you have a problem you will feel stressed, this stress can be bad for your brain but it can also help you to be more patient and determined in your goal that is solving your problem, with this two things your personality will be stronger that before the problem.

In conclusion, I think that Duke Ellington is right because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger. So if you are in a problem you should take the lead of this situation and be determined in solving it, is not the end of the world only because you have a problem, and now you know that problems can help you.",3.5,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,7.0

If we want to live our own life you should start by taking a break. Think how people would like to live their lifes and then, use this as an example but do not use it for your own. We all know that life isn't easy as we want but that's life, we cannot change it. If you put your life in hands of an expert you will have the opportunity to succed but it will feel strange and you will regret later. Why? if you ask why, and this is because everything you have done it's thanks to someone else not to you, you are not living your own life, youar not having fun, no mistakes, no experiences, no control of your own life. There's always going to be a person telling you what to do and if you don't follow his/her directions something could go wrong. That's why you should live your life as you want to live it without anybody help. At first, you can have a teacher during a period of time but it doesn't mean that you will have to go and ask for help everytime you have a problem. Make your own decisions mean that you will do mistakes but you will learn even more from this and it will help you to do thigs better and it also will help you like a human. When I said human I mean that you will have your own thoughts about something and your own way to live your life and no like a robot that just follow direction and have no sense of humor.

Everyone thinks and look at the as a piece on somethings useless but if you really meet them and talk to them you will realize that they are smart and all they do and what they have in their brains is even better than what we have. The way they think and the way they look at other people make them specials and unique. Now, what can experts do to change their life or take the control of what they want to do?. As we all know, they cannot do anything and no matter what the situation could be the answer will be the same. Their decisions and their style of life before the actual I think were made by someone else and after a while they were not able to pay for what they had. Experts help you to get things but do you really think they will help you when you are really on trouble? or will they help you with things you have to pay? the answer to this is NO. In my opinion they help you because they want something from you or they will try to get something from you after you learn it. Two years ago I met an old man from Washington DC, his name was Generic_Name. His parents are from Generic_City and Generic_City. Before homeless he was a mechanic but one day while he was fixing a car he met a person who told him that he could help him to have his own workshop and he accepted. Everything was good for the first years but after some years the person left the country and Generic_Name didn't have the capacity to manage the whole store. Bussiness came down, deppression started to make him use drugs, and after a while he lost everything he had and the expert (person who help him) wasn't there to help him when he really needed him.

If you think you have the capacity to succed on your own, you have to do it and don't let anyone ruin what you have planned for your own future. It doesn't matter if he is a proffesional, you just need to learn what you need but never let them maneuver your life. People will always try to control your life but you are the one who is going to decide if you want to live the life they want you to live or the one you want to live. I am not saying that you have to ignore the advices they give you but don't follow their directions.

Nothing is difficult if you really try it and nothing can be impossible if you really want to do it. Do not live like a robot, don't let anyone take adventage of your incapacity to succed just because you do not know anything. Ask questions, ask for advices and opinions but don't do want they want to do with your life. I know life isn't easy to live but remember that we just have one and after death we cannot do anything about it. Life is going to beat you up, experiences will make you stronger every single day, decisions will make you be independent, and at the end you will see that everything you did was good and you have what you wanted without anybody help. My friend, if you let people maneuver your life, then you will cry and you will not have the future you wanted. Everything will be destroyed and disgrace will follow you anywhere.

Don't follow experts, be one of them and do your own life, have a family, have a car, an partment or whatever you want to have without asking anyone. Help is given by God when you born. He gave you two arms, two legs, two eyes and a body. A person help you to walk and talk and one time you learn this you become an indepentent person. Do everything by yourself and don't let people make you feel useless because God make them the same as you and as everyone else but they have not develop their mental capacity the waht make them special. If you do everything by yourself people will try to destroy you but be strong and try even more until get what you want. Never try to kill yourself if you don't know what to do it is better if you believe in God and in his help because he is the only one who can help you without taking anything away from you.

Never give up and follow your dreams, live your life as you want to live it but remember that no one can control what you can do if you don't want to. Life depends of you and what you do with it. No matter what happen you have to do what makes you happy always just trusting God. Remember that just God and family are our friends. Anyone else is just people we know. Fight for what you really want no matter what comes next.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,7.0
D10BBD82D66F,"Former Primer Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", and in my opinion I agree with Churchill's words. Failure has a enormous role in success. Failure is all about, learning from the mistakes you made and gaine all the experience you can out of it, Not giving up and plan what can you do better to accomplish what you have been fighting for to get even better results that the ones you were expecting in the first place, that is what failure is all about and that is why it has big and important a role in the pursuit of success.

Learning from the mistakes that were done is a big example of the role that failure has on the pursuit of success; throughout history there had been many times were our society, nation, and specie had learned from their mistakes; as an example of this is the League of Nations, it was created after WWI to maintain worldwide peace; It end up being a big failure. we learned from this and the U.N was created to maintain global peace through nations and till present days it stills been one of societies biggest success. this is an example of how learning from mistakes you have made in the past is useful but overall this is one of many examples you can put to show how failure is related to success.

Not giving up is also really important on this because giving up is not an answer as an example of this is, Pele, he became one of the best soccer players in history but it also became the youngest player to win a world cup, since a really small age he was told that he was never going to become a soccer player, he was told numerous time that his talent was not enough, but he did not gave up, he gave all he had and when he had the chance he showed everyone of what he was capable of and became one of the best players in the world. In his debut on first world cup he suffered an injury on his knee while training for the first match, it let him out for half of the of world cup. Doctors told him that he had to do exercise every day to get better, but that he was not going to be able to play in the whole tournament; he did not give up he trained day after day and in the third phase of the world cup he was given an opportunity to play in one of the games. This is a great example of the strength that people have when they do not give up and they give all they are capable of. This is also a great example that shows how failure has many things directly related at helping people to success at what they are trying to achieve.

Another example of how failure can help you success is trying once more. this is the most important feature in the relationship of failure and success because once you have looked back at what you did wrong last time and learning from that, you are ready to try once more and accomplish what you have been fighting for. As an example of this is the spaceships that have send to space to reach many places in the universe. Its well known that many of the spaceships that have been send to space failed, and in really big proportions. Many of those spaceships exploded do to problems on their systems or other problems. After many tries looking at what failed and what went wrong humans were able to send satellites and people to the outer space, it took many failures to till we got all of this finished, now we are able to send spaceships throughout the galaxy to explore the stars and many other places. failure taught us what were we doing wrong, and we learned from it, this shows us of how failure is related to success by trying many times to achieve what you are fighting to achieve.

Many people believe that failure is not related in any way to success, they have arguments saying that, you can accomplish something at the first try, that you do not learn anything from the mistake or the times you have failed at something, and they also say that you lose all enthusiasm when you fail numerous times at something. I believe this people are wrong because you do not always accomplish something in the first try, and you always learn from your mistakes, you might learn valuable lessons out of them; their last argument can be denied by telling to yourself that you can do it, we decide when do we lose our enthusiasm or not. this is why I believe they are wrong failure is related in the pursuit of success even if we want it or not because you learn and gain experience out of it, that is what makes this world a better place, failure, and it might sound like is not true but I believe it is; failure is always there and we can always learn valuable lessons out of it.

Like I stated in my examples above failure is related to success; failure is not a bad thing because we learn from the mistakes we have done, we can gain experience out of it, we learn what are we doing wrong, but what we have to keep in mind is that we decide if we lose the enthusiasm in something whenever we decide to do it, this is why I believe that the words that Winston Churchill said are true, because from failure to failure we learn from the mistakes we made along the way to success, we can think of a better plan with the things we learned and after that we can try once more to accomplish the thing we have failed with better results that those we were expecting. That is why I think that failure is related to success. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,7.0
7BBB35F9D1BD,"If I had to take a side I think I would disagree. One reason is that you cant always have success ,there's times where somethings don't work out. Then there's failure and thats how you have success in anything from learning from your failure But there is time where when you fail and your enthusiasm is gone because of that.

The one reason I agree is because there's time that you just cant have success. I have had that in my life in many situations. Once when I was playing soccer we had won all the games and then came to the day where we were playing for first place and we lost and that day all my enthusiasm was gone. I was so mad and just had no energy. I learned that there times that I wont win and times I will it's part of life but along the way I learn new things. Then there school there you do go from failure from failure to success because once you make a mistake and you learn from it and do better next time because your already know now but it does bring your enthusiasm down.

The next reason is that failure does does make you have success but also it make not encourage to keep going. From the first time you fail to the next will will learn something and later on when it happens again that's will you will get it. When you do fail and fail you lose enthusiasm but gain it back when you have success. You feel sad and mad and just not excited no more when you keep failing again and again. So when you fail and fail again you will away lose enthusiasm because you just can't get it.

So if I had to pick a side I would disagree because you cant just fail and fail and then have success and not lose enthusiasm. And I disagree from experience because in my life I fail and never still had enthusiasm after failing maybe some people do but I speak from my point of view.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,7.0
2D0355EBD79E,"How do we feel when we see homeless people wandering around outside during winter seasons? It is so sympathetic and sad immediately we come across one. Attitude is the arrangement of the body or figure. A person's good or bad behavior begins to be obvious based on their actions. Actions and how we even talk can make people easily judge us in a good or bad way. Our actions show how we are and even help others predict our future lives. A positive attitude is the key to success in life. Good actions are keys to every good and successful doors in this world. In today's world, there are lots of sufferings and struggles so to cope in life, you need some good behaviors to overcome all the obstacles. Some importance of positive attitudes are; love,blessings, and success.

A positive attitude persuade people to love us. Commercials on televisions are not there just to make us happy but to persuade people to buy whatever they are advertising. No one is going to use some filthy dresses for commercials on televisions but the ones in good qualities because, everybody love things which are in good qualities in this world. Even before a man gets married, he really studies and examine the behavior of his love before they get married. Marriage is a long journey full of good and bad moments so, to have peace in life, we all plan very well to choose good partners who, can help us watch our babies togather.

Our good behaviors attract people to us which also makes us strong in life. President Agyekum Kuffour, who was a president in Ghana won the hearts of his people. This president knew how crucial humans are so, during his rule, he helped Ghana by building hospitals, decreasing the amount of money on goods so that all all the rich and poor can survive and made education very important. Poverty is a very difficult sickness which is so hard to let go sometimes. Poverty hides people in the dark and even prevent them from participating in some activities sometimes. So we must always help the poor, try our best, contribute to what we can reach and love one another because in today's world money is the leader of everything. A positive attitude does not only persuade people to love us but also makes us blessed.

A positive attitude brings more blessings in our daily lives. Blessings ask divine care and protection for us. Blessings are the good points we earn due to our positive lives which also exempt us from all bad situations. Some positive attitudes like helping the poor, homeless,widows, orphans, and sick people causes more blessings. In my opinion, to spend much money on expensive things like watches, makeups, many dresses, and phones, just donate a dollar to orphans and homeless people and this is going to give you some protection because some orphans were born so special, unique, and their words are like billions of money. In the bible, Abraham and Sarah married for so many years without a child. They followed their creator's commandments and rules but waited patiently for a child. Immediately they were blessed with one, God asked Abraham to sacrifice his only son, Isaac to him but he was obedient to God. Let me ask this question. ""If it was us, were we going to do what Abraham did?"" I don't think so. Meanwhile, God was just testing Abraham's faith and he was blessed by God after his positive attitude toward Him.

You will never know where your help or success is going to come from so we must always show love to one another because our success can come in a form of blessings from our own people around us. If our positive attitude brings us more blessing, we will go higher in life too.

A positive attitude makes us reach higher places in life. With blessings for our positive attitudes, we can definitely enter through all the good doors in life. As stated in the bible ""obeying is a blessing and disobeying is a curse"" is the same as respecting makes you go higher and rudeness makes you end terribly in life. A parent who knows best will never give birth and hate their own child. Every parent want the best for their children. Respecting our parents are just like a full pot of gold. Not only to our parents but our teachers, counselors, custodians and everyone on this earth. You can never disrespect some people and go free on this earth you have to face some bad consequences so we must show some positive attitudes and this can make us go higher in life. Last time, I was watching a movie alone. In the movie, a woman gave birth to two beautiful girls. so when they grew up, the elder child started disrespecting her parents, treated and talked to them like her age mates. She refused to do all house chores and leave everything on her younger sister. When it was time for them to marry, her younger sister got a very good and humble gentleman because every man wants peace but the elder one married three men but they all broke her heart. This movie taught me a lot in life. Obeying is success and disobeying goes with a total downfall in life.

Life is tough, life is complicating sometimes and life is also difficult. To go higher and to get to a better place in life, you will never get it in an easy way. Positive attitudes open all the good doors for us. It makes us shine in public, classify us as very unique, brings us peace, love, blessings, and makes us go beyond the successful roads. So, to prevent all bad consequences, we must show some positive attitudes because it does not cost to be nice to people. Loyal relationships values the most. Our first bath in our lives was taken by someone and our last bath will be taken by someone. We must all be in our lane and also support others in their lanes because, together, together we can accomplish all our missions very peacefully!

BD994514CE6C,"Does the online or video conferencing have a benefit on long distance student ? some people believe that online classes does not have any benefit because it is hard to focus an hour or more on a device ,most of the students feel sleepy when they watch long videos ,and they can easily cheat .However, I believe that online classes for the distance learning is a great way to learn because it save much time and money ,less drop out,

less illiteracy ,and good for adults and students (who have babies or jobs)

Less drop out .A vivid example .I have a friend . she was a student at Northern Community College. she was an A,B student. one time, her mom was sick .she could not move her body parties or even talk to them. so she couldn't leave her mom or her younger brothers alone and go to her college. she did not go to her class three time . after that she went back to her class but she find herself out of that class she tried to explain to her professor but he did not pay any attention. she stayed outside to meet him after the class but he did not even believe her. she tried to do many things but she could not .she was in her second year and it was the end of her semester. she can not graduate without that class so they told her that she has to stay one more year. so she decide to dropout of her classes and work.

Save much time and money . For example :my sister college is three hours away form our home. our dad does not allow us to be away from home for any issue (reason) even college . so she has to drive every three days six hour ( back and force). she does not like drive , but she has to . by taking her classes online so she will save all that time and she will safe money by not paying for her gas every week . and she will work more hours and save .it also will positive effect in the environment by less the pollution and the traffics.

less illiteracy. It also good for adults (for girls that has a babies. and boys who have to work instead or learn),In my experience, my mom long time ago was in college ,but after i came to the life she could not go her college as usual anymore because she does not have anyone that she can leave me with instead of my dad , and my dad was working two jobs. and she could not take me with her. unfortunately she leave her classes. she is penitent and she always telling me that ""if these opportunity was in that time, she would not drop out "".

So, that is why online and video classes is a great opportunity for all of us because it saves many hours and our gas ,more college student will graduate on time ,and adult or moms educations . by doing this opportunity we will progress. all the students in a long or a short distance,have or have not babies will take their classes anywhere they prefer and anytime they want even at the midnight.

9E753C182039,"What I believe is that your either trying to get attention or really going through a hard difficult time and the people you already went to and gave you advice didnt really help with what you going through or trying to do. You really just want a person to give you really good advice and see if it help you, if it doesnt help you go talk to another person and see if the advice they give you is more comfortable and helping. The reason some people do this is because they probably get the same advice the other person already told you and already tried doing that and it just doesnt seem to do anything really. What i would to is try to go find a person that has been through the stuff your going through/trying to do and take their advice it really help because that person has already been through those things or tried to do those things and went to someone that has already been through it to and took their advice and it really seem to work.

They might just also go get advice from multiply people to see which advice the person gives them is best. They can also just be going to person to person for advice to see if they are really there and car about you when your going through a really difficult time. They can be doing that because the person they went to first was not really giving them advice about what your going through and just throwing things in that dont even make sense. I would just go to someone that really gets you and is there for you and knows how you feel.

Some people that do this just really want comfort because you never know what their going throw and really just wanna take everything off there mind and just want advice for all the things their going through. It really is hard to find someone with good advice but you never seem to find a person that give you that one good advice.

C4F2187EAD44,"If students could use a cell phone during class to do classwork it would be hard for them to focus on the work.

Students would be on other things other then work. Classwork would be wrong or not turned in. Well in some schools students can use their phone to do educational work, but this can cause students to no do work in class, students cell phone could run out battery, and can cause bullying.

Therefore, this can cause students to not do work. Such as students can be texting thier friends. Students could say they are working , but they are really watching a movie. Their are many popular social media app that students like to be on. Meaning if students use thier phone during class they will probably be cheacking thier social media apps.

Also, students cell phone could run out of battery. If students stay after school for sports they need to have battery on thier phone to call parents once it's over. Some students have work after school and can't go home to charge thier phones. When they have to call thier parents to pick them up they won't have battery. Then how can the student get in contact with his/her parents.

Mostly, classmates could bully each other. Classmates might bully the students that don't have a good phone. This could cause fights or arguments to break out during class. What if a students doesnt own a phone and a classmate makes bullies him for not having one. This could cause serious bullying probelms.

Some students use cell phones in classroom for educational purpose, but this can cause students to not do work in class, students cell phone to run out of battery, and can cause bullying.

BAF91D191B43,"First of all working alone or either with groups has advantages and disadvantages, and the reasons why depend in several factors such as: ""topic or type of work"". There is a lot of people that prefer to work alone as well in groups but at the end it's all a personal preference.

In my opinion I think working alone is the best option because it allows you to do what you want to do, to do it without fear because what others might think and if made a mistake or your experiment fail you can easily go back to the drawing board and make a new one. Working alone it's a challenge and in my opinion thats wonderful it will make you feel strongly in what you believe in and always stand by what your say for example you have been assignment to ""why you should ask to mature people to make a decision"" you will be given your own opinion without other thoughts that may will make you feel confusing.

In the other hand some people think that working in a group it's a better option than working alone because of the help that you may reside from your partner or also you may interactive with other people and make new friends or also gain more knowledge by other people thoughts. Working in groups can also change your opinion to a better one or make decisions faster. Example if you are working in groups and you have to make a research about 4 best ways to improve the economy in U.S.A, each person will choose one way which means that would be a piece of cake.

Furthermore working alone it's the best option knowing that has more benefits than working in a group and one of the most reasons why it's because you are doing it at your way and your ideas you have everything in other words ""the ball is firmly in your court"". Working in groups it's not that free you have to either agree with them or to argue with them and if that's not enough stress you may had to deal with some guy who doesn't like to do work and that ends in more work for the group or lets say that every one in your group had to do one part of the assignment but one of them did nothing so now your group fail the assignment and at the end you wish you where working alone. I remember a couple months ago I had to work in groups and we had to choose what was the best topic for history and it was awful we literally were discussion for more than one day and we did not complete the assignment.

In conclusion if you work alone you don't risk to fail the assignment because of your partner and you also avoid to been in a discussion to see who's right, that will make you feel uncomfortable or even fail the assignment . Both sides are interesting and fun but I strongly believe that working alone has more benefits and feels more free than working in groups.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,7.0
61EDBF8CEC7D,"Do you get boerd being at home all the time? Well, imagine having to go home and take classes online. Some say, students benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video confrencing. On the otherhand, others suggest that students taking classes online can cause lot's of distraction, being anti-social, and giving an oppurtunity to cheat on a subject without getting true help, and support from a teacher in school.

We all like being on social media and communicating with our friends and family whenever we have the chance. But, texting your freinds and trying to do your work at the same time can be a huge distraction. However, if a student is giving an advantage to take classes online, it will cause a student to get off task and go on their phone without having the right discipline like a regualr school would have.

In a regular school, students would have the oppurtunity to communicate with their peers. For example, if a teacher assigned a project for the class and told them they are able to work in groups. This wouldn't only count as a grade but, being able to be social with your classmates and not being able to do the work independently. Which is a great idea so that it wouldn't cause a student to be ant-social.

Finally, giving a student the advantage to take classes online will give them the idea of going to a different website and finding the answers to the question. Ironically, that's what a student would do if they had the chance to. But,

would it be helpful to ask for guidence, from someone who can actually give you some ways to help make you understand the topic. Not being able to get that type of help can be stressful and cause you to cheat.

In conclusion, taking classes online isn't a bad idea if wanting to finish school faster. But, it can also cause you to get distracted , anti-social, and not having the ability to get proper help when struggling with a specific topic.                ",4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,8.0

E96C123FAC95,"CHOOSE YOUR OWN CHARACTER

The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote,""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""Do we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? Take a position on this issue. Do we need to choose are own character traits yes, or no? In my opinion I will say yes we need choose our character because If we choose our character we can be wherever we want, good,or bad person, etc and we are going to do a good job if we choose our own character traits.

First, If I choose my own character I will give my best work because I choose my own character, and I'm going to feel very comfortable, and so happy to do it my character. For example, I remember one friend from my country hi's name were Generic_Name and he was doing a activity school was theater, and they were doing the story of Little Red Raiding Hod, and he was acting the wolf he was the bad gay, and he did a really good job I was so impressed, I remember he say in the stories I always I'm going to be the bad guy because the bad guy is the second most important character, and is the conflict of the story the one who make interesting the story.

Next, you can develop and demonstrate your skill acting, If you choose your own character because you are going to do a great work, and you are going act like you are a real actor and maybe you can discover acting, If have a passion of acting. For example, I hear some stories about actor. How they like acting, and they say in the first time they didn't liked to act but them there was starting like how they act, that how they like to acting because it's fun to act, and you can enjoying acting with your friends.

Finally, If I do one character I don't like, or I don't choose probably I'm not going to give my best work because I'm not going to feel comfortable or exacting to do it. For example, I remember like 3 years ago In my English 9 class we do a act about Romeo And Juliet and they give my the character of the guard and I was not exacting to do it, so I didn't do very well but I try I think If I try maybe I will like the character but I didn't liked that why I prefer to choose my own character.

In conclusion, If you choose your own character you are going to do a good job and great work, you are going to demonstrate and develop your skill acting If you do the character you choose, and if you do a character you did choose you probable are not going to do a great job, or maybe you are not going care about the character this are the reason why is good to choose a character them someone give you a character. So remember choose your own character don't wait Intel someone give you a character,and don't forget is telling you the one who wrote the article. >_<",3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,6.0

Well first off because if you don' t push your self to see if you can accomplish something better then what you already accomplished you'll never know what your'e capable of. For example, One day i was at the gym and i accomplished my goal on legs press which was 585lbs but I knew can accomplish beyond that. I told myself "" I can do this "" so i added more weight and went up to 630lbs I was extremly proud of myself. It will also test my mentality to see how hard im willing to push myself to be a bigger person in life; If i will give up easy or try till I succsed. Also pushing your self beyond your goal you mastered the first time will motivate other to do the same ;therefore, they will ask you for help to push beyond the masterd goal and you will feel proud of yourself for doing so. Going beyond your first achivment could possibly help you with you future job you will be able to get a really good paying job and tell you self "" i made the right choice "". Pushing beyond your mastered achivement is the best thing ever to do you will makeyourself proid and so will you make others proud. in conclusion pushing yourself is the best thing to do so you can see what your really capable of and find whats' really inside you that you've been holding back this whole time                                                                                                                     ",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,6.0
1C32F25C46EE,"I will say that i desagree with the idea of having distance learning for our's studente to take classes from their home i suggest have doing it the same way as always and have that as a better option.

first reason why: because a lot's of teacher keep their work and keep doing it as they use to and that can that many teacher don have to lose their case there might a lot of them that prefer having a classroom full of student or some others just prefer that way is easier or they like to comunicate with the student and that is something that some times can benefit the student.

second reason student can learn how to be more socialise with others students and that can make them have better comunication with other people for example it would be a lot easier to get job by them self cause that make them feel sure about them self and that make the student better on almost all their classes.

Third reason is that shools can steel be use normaly as long everything is ok with them an the steel can have a porpuse for many reson for students. but some people said that having the student take those from home by way of online or video conferencing might let some student have a more flexeble schedule because at the fact they in their home but i said this might corrupt the student learnig there might tha have acces to wifi or dont transport you know having to go to a library so that's why apik this position about having to take classes online.",2.5,3.0,2.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,5.0
F3F4454A2E3B,"Most companies look for specific characteristics in potential employees. Some people think that companies shouldn't look for specific characteristic in people and let the person thats applying, get the job and learn while he/she is working with the company.

Some people have a better education than others, which that would be one of the characteristics that company would be looking for, trying to hire someone. But sometimes those people aren't good working with other people and in my opinion that is very important to keep and good work environment. I think I'm a very good candidate because, I'm good working with people, I am always willing to work extra hours if you need me to, and finally I'm may not have much experience on this kind of work but I'm a pretty hard worker and will try my absolute best to learn the job.

One reason, I think I should be hired is that I'm good working with people. One of the things I enjoy the most about working is the ability to work and share ideas with people in my past jobs, I feel like it makes the work environment a lot better because it make the work easier and more enjoyable. Because the more are working together the job gets done faster, I'm always willing to help if anybody needs me I'll be there planning things out with the person give him/her feed back on what she thinks and work out something that can work for both the company and themselves. I try get along with all my work partners so I can make it the best experience for me and for everyone else around me.

Another reason, is I'm always willing to work extra hours if needed. I worked extra hours in past jobs before because for one my work co workers because they were sick. So if you ever need me to work for extra hours don't hesitate to give me a call. Because we all need a break sometimes, but there are times where we can't give the workers that break because the company doesn't have enough people to cover that person. That's why I'm willing to work longer hours so those workers can take that break they so much desire.

Finally, I'm a hard worker like you read in the last paragraph I'm willing to work longer hours, so that should give you an idea. What ever job you give me I'll do it at the best of my ability, it doesn't matter what it is I'll do it. Although I dont know how to do much of what this type of does, I'll do my best to learn it as fast as possible so I can give you the best results I can give. I'm always willing to do something new and challenging so I can extend the things I know, All I want you to know is that what ever you tell to do I will give my one hundred percent.

As you have read this why I think I make a good candidate and a good addition to your team. I'm good working with people, I'm willing work longer hours if needed, and I'm a hard worker. I hope you consider hiring me and i hope the best for the company. I think only when you see me actually working in your company and see the things I'm able to bring to the table you will see I was the best option for the job.

914A5E042E73,"""Did you know that the school board is extending the school day?"" said Generic_Name friend with no excitement. ""

UGH

, i already get exhausted and frustrated with the normal school day,and now I'll have to deal with longer school days,"" responded Generic_Name while doing her homework. I disagree with the idea of extending the school day, because students need more social hours, family time, and most importantly rest.

First of all, communication is a very important skill, factor of living. everyone, specially students need some free time, or better known as 'social hour'. Not just in school, but also outside of school communication is highly recommended by all doctors and specialists. Yet with extension to school hours everyday this opportunity would be ruined.

Nevertheless, we all need endless family time to discuss your thoughts or share some of your ideas with our beloved families. in addition, Some kids also go to after school clubs which obviously will take evn more of their time. Furthermore, there won't be much time left to spend with their families. According to a survey in 2017, students who spend more time with their families have a better attitude, greater chance of success, and a better mental health.

Finally, and most importantly, students need to get some rest in order to be able to function properly. However, when having to wake up at 6:00 AM, and having an extra one and a half hours to your normal school day there will not be enough time left for resting and other activities students need to be doing. Therefore, 'rest' would just be a metaphor.

All in all, an extension of an hour and a half to school everyday does not seem like a good idea, because all students need to have a skill called 'communication'- a needed skill, factor in life. Also, in order to have a greater chance of success, a better mental health, and a better attitude they need more or just enough family time, and for students to mentally, physically function properly they need more rest. In conclusion, extending the school day will not favor students.                       ",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,8.0

Although Thomas Jefferson says if inactivity also serve a purpose in life, in my opinion, when you do not do anything you will never get a result of good things always we have to try to do some effort to be someone in life.

In addition, According to the prompt and ""determine never to be a idle"".

CC149CD4B584,"In this paragraph I will write about how students can take classes from their homes and if they are going to do good in the works that the teachers give to the students on online, talk to the cousolers or tho his admistrator, the students will have some benefit, Students will have benefits with the grades.

If the student offer distance learning, First he must have to talk to his counsoler about doing classes online and disscus with her about he can stay home and do the classes online. Second, the students have to take test before they do the classes online because the teachers or another people from the school can see if he really is going to do the work at home and be prepaed for all the work that the teacher will give to him/students. Finally, the teachers will see and talk to his counsoler or administrator if they do good in the test and see if they can saty at home and do the classes online also the teacher should give a recomendation to the students if they have to take classes online.

The students will have some benefits if they take classes online, First, the students obiasly will have benefit because they will be doing all work at home and they can ask for help to his/her brothers or sister at home and they can help to do the work and if they have a test in the class that he is taking he will pass because he can see the notes or some works that he finished before. Second, They will have benefit because they are not going to school and he can go out during the day and also do the work when they're out. Finally, Students also will have benefit because they can do the work whenever they want bacuse if they have the classes online at the computers is more easier for example, if they only have to take notes they only can see another attachment of the same thing and if they have a test they will see the notes or another paper about the test.

Students will have benefits with the grades. Firts, the students will have good grades because they will have a lot of time do the work that is assigment for the next day or the same day and they will be concentrate because they are going to be alone at home. Second, The students will have a lot of benefit in that because they can see some work abouth the assigment and have a 100 points in the assigment or if they have a project that the students who are in the school they only will have a hour to do it because the others teacher will give a lot of homework to them but the student whp is taking classes online he will have a lot of work too bute he will have all the day to do it or the next day.

In conclusion they can't take classes online because they will have a lot of benefits that the students who is going to school and they can sleep a lot and the regular student has to wake up early and they can't have benefit with grades or other benefits,

In my opinoin students should not to take classes online because that is going to be more easy than the stduent who take classes at school becuase the students who is in the school they are not going to have he same benefits as the students who take classes online.",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0

5923F6631724,"' Why do we have to go school for eight and a half hours for five days per week? We can't do anything after school!'' Please imagine that situation. If that situation became for real, how are students going to react to it? Of course, they are going to be mad, and they might have more stress. Therefore, although some people agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day because students can have time for studying, and it is very educational for them, I disagree with that idea because it interferes their family time and after school activities, and it is going to become cause of they have more stress.

First of all, students can't have time for family and other activities. At recent, many kids hang out with their friends than families especially teenagers. I think students should have more family time to having great relationship with thier families. Additionally, some students have activities after school. Activity is an essential way to relax and have fun, and it also helps students find new hobbies and make new friends. As a result, if adding one and a half houres to school, it steals a lot of wonderful opportunities from students.

Second, it gives more stress to students. Some students have large amount of stress already. During the school week, they study for about seven hours per day, and sometimes they need to work on project and study for quizes and tests. Also, they have homework at least one subject everyday. That's why students have a lot of stress. To decrease their stress, school needs to give a time to relax for them after school.

In conclusion, adding more time to school has many disadvantages for students. Students need family time and time to work on their activities after school to have fun and relax. School is not a place that give a stress to them. School is a place that give a opportunity to get interesting knowledges to them. I believe school should overrule this idea if you think about students.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,7.0
9C6132E41DDE,"If I was to explain to my teacher if I prefer to work in groups or work alone, I would pick work alone. Working alone is good because you could think of ideas that some students can't think about. For example,working alone can get you a better high score in the class then working in groups. Another example is when your working in groups it can cause you to not finish the work you started because your either talking or not focused in what your supposed to do. In some cases some students like working alone because they get to turn in there work on time so they don't have to fail the class. Another example, some students are really quiet and they are shy to talk to people so they work alone so they don't need to be behind everyone else who isnt doing there work.

Students often don't really get a lot of help from other students when they work in groups. Often some kids make the mistake on joining groups but then when it comes to doing work only 2 students do the work and then the other 2 don't do anything. Students sometimes don't even do anything they just sit around and talk to there friends about other things then they talk about the work they need get done or there on the phone or playing games. For example some students don't like doing anything they just like to sit around and talk but on the other hand they are students that like doing there work so it's best to see that students like working alone then to be working in groups. In some cases some students don't let them talk to there friends because they think they are gonna make there child fail that class and some parents are gonna blame the friends then there own children. For example if a parent gets a phone call from a teacher saying oh your student is failing my class because there not doing there work like they used to before the parent is gonna feel bad because there gonna think oh my child is hanging out with kids there not supposed to be with. In my opinion I think it's best for students to work alone then to be working in group.

87263FC3308B,"SCHOOL VACATION

Summer vacation is better than winter vacation. some people travel in another country or state of United State because they do not like to live with cold they prefer hot place. I am desegree that some teacher argue that there should be year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring. But we study like 8-9 mouth why they want more time to study.

If they want a longer winter how we can enjoy winter because in the winter: snow, to much cold, we just can stay in home and we will get stress. I prefer a longer summer break because we can practice sports, we can go to the bitch and we can to cook out side to make (carne asada).

Practice sport is a good thing in ours body that we can do in summer, sport like soccer, baesibol and we can run on the street with our friend. Soccer is one of sport that we can practice in summer because you can make a team and you can go to in the big liga to competion with another team, and you can make new friend in that liga, and if you like soccer maybe you can go to in big team like Barcelona, Galaxy, Real Madrid team like that. Also the benefit that you can get in this practice sport, you can care your health because you will not see your mobile phone to damage your eyes or you will be a good person because you will have not stress, and you will have a good body because you will not stay in your bed to get fat. Also you can learn in practice sport maybe your do not know some sport but you have friend that they know how those sport play you will know after that you will feel good when your friend will talk about beacause you can share your opinion before you do not talk with bacuase you knew about that sport.

Another good thing that you would be in summer is go to the bitch with your family to enjoy the sun, the sand, or when the shark go out to the sea. Watch the sun on the sea in the morning and say woawoawoa......But if you have money you can travel in another country where you can find coco or palm, country like Mexico where you can enjoy agua de coco (coco of water) or sleep under a palm without think, you will forget for a moment the bad thing that you had or work, study, enemiges etc...that is another reason that i want a longer summer because i want to forget for a moment all my bad thing while the time past i will have more power to star a new year of school. I was very enjoy the last summer because we had 3 mouth and I went to different country to enjoy the sea and I made the sand bull with my brother and I ate a lot shellfish, I like shellfish because when i was kid my father told me, when you will be young you will strong because the shellfish contain a lot vitamine but I did not like and when we traveled he always told me if you will not eat the shellfish, you will not food for this day so I scared a lot and that day was my first time when I tried some. Now I like a lot shellfish, always when we go to the bitch my family in hotel called for some shellfish because now all family like shellfish. Shellfish is the first food that we eat.

Carne Asada is another thing that I can do it for summer. Carne Asada mean barbeque, carne asada is name of food that Latin America call. For to make carne asada it is to have a clear sky because when you cook, you need to have your drill out side of the house and than you can to cook. This i can do during the winter because it si cold and i will freezing my body that is why i prefer a longer summer for to cook many time carne asada and share with my friends or my family. Also we can go to the park and to cook there too. It is beutiful when I do this thing because all my family to arrive in my house and we can talk about our story or when my grandfather is talking all my family have to keep quiet because he is talking about his past life and his idea is to propose good future for us. Also we can dance anything music that we can like. This are moment that I can forget because in winter all this thing is end.

Summer is a moment that must people like because you can do many thing, you can enjoy of your family and friend, because in winter only you can stay in your home watch television, phone, play fornite etc.... And i do not like all of those thing, I like to enjoy my youth because when your are a youngn you have to exploration your mind and you have make new friend and I believe in your house you can not do this and you will died in your home without friends. That is why I prefer longer summer because if they gime me just 3-4 week of summer I can not do enything and I will not want to came back at school, I will be bore. Summer is the thing that we can enjoy and make many thing for to preperate for the winter because winter you can not work or travel so summer is very important.",2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,4.0
93B5C7FC9351,"Thomas Jefferson wrote a very interessing sentence about the determination that never to be idle and how much is important keep doing to accomplish our goals and always find a new one...but that sentence was made in the past,and as we know , a lot of things are changed , so we must belive that the sentce was made for other different people, with different view of things and world;so basicaly people now think in a different way , so that why, people belive that take your time during a stress work or whatever is really important, we can say, so, that inactivity is not so bad overall.

People now days are very productive, our socity is based on keep producing, just think about country like Cina or India, people keep producing and do things,that can be good and bad for the custumers and the employeers , in the bright side ,the customers can find evrithing that they wont all the time, but what is the price ? have workersreally stress: it's really stressfull for the employmeers because they are all time time under the pressure. A lot of people belive that is not productive, they belive that they must have more ""free time"",for free time they mean , just take a break to bring your mind out of the work, so , be more productive when you going back to work and also have a product with an high quality, a really quick examples: if you work for 10 hours a day, without any break , may you can produce more, with a very low quality producut but instead of 10 hours with no break , you can work the same amount of hours with a little break in between of just 10 minutes every 2 hours ,you can be a little less productive but with a huge diffent in the quality of the product .

We belive be inactive when you can be,in the right moment and time, it's more productive than be just a machine, besides be incativity just for a while can change the all quality of a product.

Most of the people think just the workers are stressed and just them can be inactive however that is not true at all .

Be inactive it's not just about the work, you can be it, in a good way, also during your regualar time, the ""normal life"" even if you are a student: just think about the life of a normal senior high school student, he/she can be really stress about different reason, like clubs,classes, schoolmats ecc....what is the best way for a teeneger,to let the stess out,to be inactive? we belive the best way to be inactive for a teeneger is dreaming, and use his/her immagination ,using an hour during the school schedual time, It's one of the best wapons ever, and usally for a young man/woman it's so much easier immagine rather than an adult. People could think how immagine could be inactivity but at the same time be productive and why in school and not wherever ? it's very simple , because when you think about somthing, you can look like you are waisting time but at the same time is like you are plalling your life, your day or week , so basicly the hour assignet to the inactivity it coul be an hour very importan and strong where let the kids grown on her/his own and , if necessary, with the adult's help, that why in school , because teacher can be a really good resource for the kids.

Another good situation where you can be inactive is during a test or a quiz: you need to take your time in any way you like it, one of them is the inactivity; when you are doing a test you do not need to stay focus all time time,usally if you do that it's worst, because it's like your brain is slowly melt down however if take a little, if you dont have much time or you do not need it,or a long time break, is good,you let your brain rest, and you can be more accurate about the test after the break, so basoclly yopu are always keeping your mind fresh and ready. People think that you are wasting your time but actually not, you are keeping it to focus on your test/quiz in a diffent way .

As a conclusion we can say if you wanna be a people how is always doing somthing is fine, more than fine , but if you wanna be a person who do a lot of things and with an high quality you should try to be, just a little and in a good way, an inactive people however ,even if you wanna constantly work, we suggest you to try to be more incative, because as you can read, be inactive does not mean that you are not doing anything althought you arre doing a really good job, keeping your mind out in order to be more wake when you need it.",2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,5.0

2823F7B47127,"Have you ever wondered if doing class work from home benefits the students? Yes, students would be able to benefit from doing class work from home. I have some strong and good reasons on why it benefits them. These reasons have been said by many people in the past that have done it as they listed; they are more focused, more time with family, more sleep, and you can do it at any point of the day.

First, more students say they feel more focused at home then what they would've been in school. For example, they say that there is no distraction to keep them from completeing their work and turning it in. Especaily, when its something important that would help them graduate from their classes. In fact, they have better thoughts of what they are going to do for their class work. Even though, when they have important family that they don't get to see as offten they would be able to spend more time with them.

As a result, students that do their class work from home have had a greater portion of passing then being in school. Thus, students have been able to work better when they have gotten a full night or resting. In other words, students have proven to be more active and awake when they wake up at there own time. Lastly, students don't worry about having to rush through the material and turning it in on time.

In conclusion, do students really benfit attending school from home? Students do benefit more when they are attending school from home. More importantly, they can focus more on the work given, as well have more time with their family, they can get plenty of sleep to do be able to do their work, and they can do their work when they feel they are ready to complete it in the day.

My grandma, always said that being in a group gives you more things to talk about. The benefits of working a group is more beneficial because,more ideas, partisan,and some one you can talk to.

Many calm that working alone will not share your ideas with other clearly, it better working in a group have fun and to talk to others.

To begin the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because having more ideas. For example my sister, Generic_Name she loves sharing her ideas. Each ideas they share with they classmates. They can have have a example on what there writing about and have an idea on what there talking about. For example my Mom,is A fourth grad teacher she loves seeing others sharing it means a lot to her. She partners up the kids and so she, can see on thing the can come up with. However,having more ideas well help us share ans being thoughtfully to other in life.

In addishly,the benefits of working with group is more benefice because, to pertipat in a class room. For example when i first stared middle school i didnt want ti partisan with no on. Because, i wanted to work bye my self. Later that week i made a Friend and, she intrdust me to the other class mats, we all disided to be together for this school project. Example my little brother Generic_Name ,he was shy to talk to others in the class room. I as an oldest sister, to if him they no need to be shy just talk to others and pertipat in class and get to know every one. that next day my brother was happy to with others. However,partisan is a good way to show others an example and make new friends

Finely the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because, having some one to talk to for example my friend Generic_Name, didnt have have nothing tot talk to for example my friend Generic_Name,didnt have nothing to think of .I was helping her on some thing we can together thinks of. I as a friend was there to listened to was she had to say. Example my other friend she wasnt at school because,her Grandpa, pasted away she misted on what we were working on. So i want to show her on the thinks she missed out. It helped her a lot.

In concluss the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because, more ideas, partisan, and some you can talk to.                    ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,5.0
6F63F3BCD18D,"Why do we accomplish more when we're busy? Because when your doing mutiple things at once you tend to move a bit faster and get things done quicker. When you're inactive, you tend to be more lazy and by being lazy you don't get things done. Always be active in life and if you're not you won't be able to accomplish anything.

Mr. Thomas Jefferson once said ""Determine never to be idle ... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I do agree with Mr. Jefferson, by being lazy and stubborn will get you nowhere in life. Inactivity serves a big purpose, why people don't accomplish anything. In life people make goals and you have to push yourself to the limit to accomplish your goals. People nowadays tend to do things later because if the task doesn't have to be done now then they'll do it later. But I would say do all the tasks that need to be done as soon as possible, so you can have free time later on.

When, we're always doing, you never think about taking a break. But when your doing nothing, you get tired, sleepy or drowsy this is why being inactive is bad for you. For example, how do you think Thomas Jefferson became a president because he worked hard and pushed himself to achieve his goals. Being active or inactive can take you to, two different places in life it's either good or bad. By being active you may go far in life and accomplish many things that you'll like. But, when it comes to being inactive you may fail in life and not get to accomplish things that you want to accomplish. People have to choose what part they want to take in either doing good or bad in life, they choose nobody else can.

By getting all you tasks done you have accomplished so much. It is very important to get things that you have to get done, done. Why you may ask because by getting everything done on time or even earlier than the tasks are due, can make you feel accomplished. By feeling accomplish may help your confidence grow and make you grow as a person. You have to be determine in life you can't just brush everything off and say you'll do it later because if your doing that you will never complete that tasks or project.

In conclusion, in life we have to complete a lot of things. By doing something all the time keeps your brain grinding. We all have our lazy days when we don't want to do anything but you have to always push yourself to do more in life. A lot of things can be done when we're busy. I support what Mr. Jeferson said, we do all accomplish many things when we're distracted. Thinking mutiple things at once can bring you a lot of benefits in life. In fact, we do accomplish more when we're always always doing something.           ",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,8.0
7FF600C1F829,"There are some young teenagers that already know a specific career they want to follow after finishing high school. Some teenagers have planned to go to college after high school and some have planned to start with a job. However, there are also some teenagers that dont have any future plans and they dont care about it. In today's societie, Schools expect students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. To help that, high schools offers many courses to help their students identify a specific career and to also guide towards them.

Starting with the disadvantage of choosing a specific career at a young age. Of a young child, it's dream career is to become a policemen or policewomen, firemen or firewomen, a actor or actress or even an astronaut. By the time the young child gets older, it's interest changes in many categories such as their dream job. Starting as a freshmen in high school, students have a big and a open mind to almost everything and so they think they already know what they want to do after high school. However, after time passes, students will learn and experience new stuff in school and out of school, and they might get to know different intreset, and opinions of their friends and classmates. Those could change a young teenagers mind and interest easily. Therefore, some students will change their courses over and over again, till they final identified a career that they really like, and enjoy. However, some other students get tired of chasing a career they once dreamed of, that they change every school year and get lazy or dont care anymore.

Another disadvantage would be that students only concentrate on their future careers and focus on their difficult classes they take, and this might sound confusing because, that is the reason why students go to school, however only focusing on work doesn't mean it's healthy for a young teenager. Taking school not seriously is not the point here, however taking school work too serious ""For the good of the students future"" can cause serious damage in important relationships, such as the relationship between a child and his or her parents could be damaged because, the child has to much pressure on his or her mind and if his or her parents interrupt, a fight between parents and child would break out. Another problem would be that the young teenager will have difficulties making friends or has difficulties to talk to other classmates about anything besides school. During the teenagers free time, the teenager wont go out and play with his friends or maybe he doesn't have any and stays at home playing video games. That's why some parents disagree with today's societies. The reason why is because, they don't like that the schools expects students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, saying that the schools should give the young teenagers time to experience and learn new things before they have to chose what they want to be in the future.

However, not all students feel the same way as the other students. In fact, many students already know what they want to do after school and appreciate the opportunity to chose specific classes. Students can better concentrate on specific class to help them and guide them towards their dream career, of course there are other classes that have to be taken, in able to graduate however, students still have the opportunity to chose specific classes. Besides having a great opportunity to get helped and prepared for their future, is that young teenagers will have more fun in class that in regular class. The reason why is because, they will have more fun working on something that their interest in then working on other class work. Making friends will also be a lot easier, because the students in the same class will have the same interest and maybe the same opinion.

Choosing a specific career that they want to follow, at a young age is big step, in fact it's maybe a to big of step for a young teenager. However, there are also many young teenagers that already identified a career that they want to follow, it pretends on how the young boy or young girl acts, motivation and working speed.

It would be better to give the young teenagers a little bit more time to think about the future and maybe to just let them experience new things and learn more about our societie, so at the end they have a clearer view on what is going on and what they maybe will be in the future, so they can better prepare themselves. However, the optional courses should not be change and they should be stay like that because, they are very helpful and perfect to prepare and guide the students towards their dream career.

As we all can see there are many pros and contras to this subject that could be disgust and argued about. Those were my .",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,8.0

I disagree that school should be more than eight hours because teachers can not manage their time, all staff will get tired, and some student have to take care of their family.

Teachers can not manage their time. For example, my math teacher Generic_Name he has another job he won't be able to manage his time between teaching the student and the other job. On the other hand, most teachers have kids and they send kids to baby care and they pay money. For example, my science teacher Generic_Name she was not able to stay after school because she has kids. Imagine you have make up work that needs to be done but your teacher is busy?

All staff will get tired. Imagine teachers, students, and people who in the cafeteria how they get tired if we make this decision? For example, I feel bad about the people who clean the cafeteria each day. All teachers will have hard time to explain to the student. For instance, I have my cousin he lives in Turkey. Their classes is about two hours and half. My cousin told me I have hard time to understand the teacher on the end of the class because he get tired.

Some Student have to take care about their family. For example, When I came from Iraq my mother had heart problem so I have to take care of her each day. My mother she was not able to cook and stand I was responsible to do that. However, when I was in my country I was responsible about my nephews as well.

Some say extending school hours is hopeful for student. They are wrong because some student don't like school so they will drop out. Some say student will have finish the school early. They are wrong student will be rushing and not able to get the lesson from first time.

Positives. Negatives. In conclusion, I hope that Generic_Name disagree this decision because student like to have fun more than studying. Also I hope all states of America will disagree on this decision.

Because helps me get better at things ,it teaches me new things that I didn't even know about, and also helps me grow smarter and as a better person. Learning from someone like my Dad.

Hearing wisdom from my Dad will definitely make me a better and smarter person. Because it will make me motivated to think like him and be like him . It will also make me work and study harder so I can get to where his telling me to. And not only I could be like my Dad one day I could probably be a better person and smarter person than him. Because my Dad would push me to work as hard to be the best.

Learning new things from someone that has an experience like my Dad can help me have more better ideas about what I'm doing . And it gives me an open mind about new ideas that I didn't even know about. It also helps me create new ways how to do stuff. And will also gives me better techniques and more ideas. So in the future I can try to change and try different things from what I have learned from my Dad.

It's also really important for my Dad to give me his wisdom, Because I can't imagine doing stuff without someone helping me on things that I don't even know about. It just helps me to stay more focus in my work by just hearing from someone Like my Dad. It makes me want to try harder than other people and be better than them. And lastly it will make me think smarter and push my self to be the best I could be.

So I think it's kinda obvious that every person or even smart people needs help sometimes from someone thats has an experienced before. Because by just hearing from them will teach you new ways new ideas and even stuff you didn't even know existed. Everyone is not perfect in this world and everyone definitely needs helps on something it doesn't have to a big thing it can be a very small things.

78018FB48420,"Students should not be able to graduate early. If students stay in school the extra year they have more opportunities. The fourth year of high school gives them more time to learn. It also gives them more time to explore different careers they might want to do. Students might be stressed out too much. It is better to take your time then to rush your career.

Students who go the last year of high school have more time to learn more. They can take more classes than those who would graduate early. The classes will be easier because they will be learning at their grade level, not a grade level above. They also won't have as much homework and classwork to do at a time.

The students will have more career choices to choose from. If they have more time they will be able to have electives that can help them choose their career. For example there is a nursing class, carpentry class, electricity class, welding class, and many more that can help them get started. If they can't take electives then they won't have experiences that may help them.

I don't agree with this, i think cellphones can be really helpful as a tool in the classroom and schools should let the students used it to their benefit that means use it only for class reasons, cellphones can be a support to the students and, many situations and, can make everything easy and queckly, it just depend how students use it. Many schools allow with the use of their phone under the supervision of the teachers.

Students bring their cellphones with out of permision, even middle schools students have a cellphones in their pockets this is a good example that schools can't stop students using their phones during school time, schools have to start thinking how we can change this as a benefit, cellphones are powerful tool and everyone agree with this but, everyone know that most of the time young people can't control their self.

If schools allow with the use of the phones can a big benefit to the teachers and students, students can search for information about the topic that their are seen in the class, internet have good information, now we have many helpful wedsides in internet, if students don't understand something in the class, they can look for online teachers in internet, there are many teachers and each teacher have their way to explain so students have many options to pick which teacher their like, and all this teacher are for free, students also can search videos or imagenes.

Student don't do or miss homework and, one of the reason why they don't do homework is because is bored or they forgat to do it, teacher can make this interesting by creating online homeworks, or creating a creative wedside where students can complete their homework. If a student miss a day of the school this wedside cam help them, many students have work after school, and most of this students get tired to do their homework at late night, teachers can help them by posting the link where they can find the specific information that they need to complete their homework, this can be a really easy way to complete their homework for those students. Sometimes students miss days of the school with a school wedside teachers can post everything that their did in class, it can help a student to don't miss anything and their can check this wedside with their phones,Teachers can make the class interesting to the students with the use of the phone making online assigments, even reading can be interesting to the students with onlines books and they can highlight their favorite part with not ruin the book.

Students get more focus just for the fact that their are using their cellphones, teachers can use the this fact to improve the class, that how teachers can use this to make the class with videos and pictures to their self explaning the topic of the class and students can joing with their cellphones. Social media is something that make tennegers crazy, many teachers are making a group discution in tweeter or instagram and students can share their ideas or information each other by comment, they also share pictures and videos about the class, this can we great for who don't like to participate in the class or for the shy students it can be more comfortable to them, the using of social media in class can be diffucult because students can distract so easily but, teacher can make an app where they are seen what students are doing and make corrections and interact each other, share thougths.

In conclusion, students can have their phones as support in the classroom because cellphones can be a really powerful and helpful tool, students ca have to use their cellphones with responsibility.

I've always loved the idea that I could one day learn about cars; how a vehicle gets off of the assembly line to the road. There are many companies that are in demand for mechanics to turn wrenches and do not care that they are going to get their hands dirty on the job and for me I would be happy just doing that for a long time.

By changing their tires and putting the tires back and doing oil changes to tuning and modifying my uncles car from a stock making two-hundred horsepower to eight-hundred horsepower. Ever since i've had experience with vehicles in my life time and working in a companies to get my degree and one day open my shop and be able to work on cars would be a dream come true. When I got older I started reading books about cars from the first ever made vehicle to where you had to crank to start the car to when technology was slowly progressing and that was not a thing anymore. Through out the years technologies have increased dramatically and vehicles are being driven by them selves and I would love to work on self derivable vehicles because I know that I would be able to make it right and make sure that the customer is always the priority and I am always hundred percent and determined to make the vehicle an high functioning machine with so much capabilities.

I agree with his statement because I achieved my marks by setting my aim very low from his statement, it will be reduce your risks, and tried to make easy work for rest of your life.

First, I achieved my marks by setting my aim very low. It can be everybody like me, but not everybody by setting their aim very low, sometimes, it was not work for them by achieving their marks by setting their aim very low. I figured it out by setting my aim low, so it helped me to achieving my marks very well.

Also, I don't want to over thinking because I don't want to waste my times, it is not easy at all.

Third, you need to tell the truth like he said, "" The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short. It was danger to tell the lies to someone else. The lies are really evil and inevitable, sometimes they will find the evidences later but, they don't know yet if that was the truth or lie. It was like 50% chance to decide if it was truth or not.

161E5C8A6719,"Studies has been showed that students that been committing to their dream career before entering high school would be most likely to get their career more successful than other students. However, it'll be a stressful/pressure thing for students because they would have to achieve it faster than others. The issue of students committing to a career at a young age is a stressful, mental thing, should not be considered because students would be more stress, they would focus on their future career and not themselves and high school makes everyone change their minds.

My firsts reason why students should not commit to their career at a young age is because they would be more stress throughout high school. Yes, high school seems like an easy place to stick to your future career but at the same time it's really not. If you commit to your career throughout high school, your're more likely to be stress because you feel like okay if i do this i'll achieve faster but not at the same time if i do this i won't be achieving. So technically you just put yourself in a position that you really can't get yourself out of. You're focus on one thing that in your other classes it's hard to think or studied about. Yes, committing is easy but it's not. Its's high school the place where your education change you. You would probably change your mind no time soon. Therefore, don't put yourself in the position to be stress.

Pressure is a main key to everything nowadays because it's ""fun"". However, it is not. Being put on pressure is the most hardest thing to be in because you feel like you have to do it to make someone or somebody proud. Like in this case your future career. You feel like you're pressure because you want to make your parents, teacher, your school admins proud and know that you can really commit to things. As days or weeks goes on, the pressure level goes up and up and when that goes up you kinda get depressed, sad and not yourself because you are doing this for them and not you.

High school changes everyone mind. As soon as, you walk into high school it's not the typically high school movie you think. It is place where students and teachers minding their selves and doing their know things. Middle school vs. High school are two different place. The classes are harder, high school have many many electives to pick from so like of course you are going to change so like why would you want to stick to your career at a young age when your haven't taken those other classes. Like your never know what you actually like when you have tried taken those classes.

In my personal opinion i would not commit to career at a young age. i learned from experiences and from other. Take the classes that you like in high and if you like keep moving on. If not, move to a different one. What your see on TV is not want you see in reality. So again in my opinion

Everyone is different, you are different. career is just a word. Don't push yourself at a young age. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,7.0

158DB6073DBB,"""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.'' Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose?

In my perspective i think that it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. Let's take a minute and think about all the things we can accomplish if we are doing something. We cant just live our lives with our hands cross waiting for things to be accomplish by itself when we are just sitting around doing nothing we are never going to accomplish things that we want to accomplish.

Its having a goal everyone has a goal in life and that goal sometimes you need work hard so it can be done . For an example my goal is to pass my sol's but i know if i dont put effort in it i wont accomplish my dream, so i am going to work hard so it can be accomplish . Another example can be that student's want to graduate of course they need to work hard so it can be accomplish. Imagine you dont accomplish things because your just waiting for it to come on its own it most likely wont come how the way you wanted it to come its going to be because you put no effort in.

What are you going to do in life if you dont accomplish things? are you just not even going to try not one single person dont have one things or few things they want to accomplish its probably taking them time, nothing goes fast in this world the more you accomplish the more successful you can be.

I still think its a good idea to accomplish things more if we are doing something it can really help us as we get older. Its wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something it can bring us happiness in our lifes Thomas jefferson did a great writing talking about is it wonderful to much may be done if we are always doing. Dont you think he had thngs he wanted to accomplish before his death he probably did accomplish some things by putting in effort and working hard on it so why cant we do the same?

2.89E+11,"Have you ever looked at someone and thought to yourself wow their kind of great or the opposite of that? Well I know from my expirecnce people tend to see me as a bad person because of the way I look, but when you get to know me it like you had it all wrong this hole time or maybe you just might keep it the same, and think i'm the bad one . Do you think like this or is it just me? Do you agree on people keeping the same opinion as they first lay eyes on you, well some researches say it almost impossible to change, but what do you think?

Almost it a lot , but would you agree on this, theres some pros and cons to this matter and it kind of brings the good and the bad to this. For example, people look at you and automatecly know how you are , i'm not going to lie but i'm just the same way. I see people and think "" ewww their awful"", but it's okay to be honest. Also , you haven't meet that person so why judge them by there appearance but , maybe they where just the way you thought them to be like. Furthermore , i'ts your opinion about that person and it your own set and time when get to see them other people might just think the opposite of it and it okay.

Know to where my head is set too , i disagree on this, i know people say ''love at first site"" but come on know do u really believe that. I truly think people can change and maybe you can be that change , because so many people think so badly about them or mighty think their so perfect. We are all humans and we all have the same emotions and it just bad to make people feel bad about them self even when it good or bad. People can change for the better or for the worst but dont we all? We might just judge someone that can be having a bad day and dont have anyone to talk too because people think so poorly about them. Also, get to meet someone first and get too know them before jumping to conclusions. It better this way i think i'm not going to say it wrong nor right because we all have our opinion of people. overall, never judge a book by it cover, we all heard this as kids and they taught us but, did they know ? know that we all grown up and we think poorly of people it like picking up a book that looks all gross and u dont even want to look at it but you make the effort and read it and it turns out to be your favorite book. Also , like making a last minute trip and it turns out to bet the best trip of your life.

In conclusion, in my own opinion it better getting to know someone first then just looking at them from the far. Some people might get the wrong sigh and take it the wrong way and make it seem that you dont like them and them giving you the wrong look and you thinking poorly because both part of the party thinking poorly of each other. But is it impossible to change that opinion you got on someone , no one will ever know until you changes it. This my way of opening some eyes and making a change because i know i have. I might seem as a bad looking person because of the way i look but really it just the day it is and just people staring at me and making me feel bad about my self. So that why i say i dont like judging anyone because i dont know hows their day going or what their going though sometimes it just better to give them pat on the back and say everything going to great or simply smile and wave hi.

DEDD5C568B4C,"I agree with being honest at all times because you need to be honest with your true friends, you need to be honest with your family, and you to be honest with yourself.

The first reason you need to be honest is with your true friends because your true friends are going to want you to tell the truth to them.

Your friends always check on you to see if you are okay and tell you how is your life so far .You got to tell the truth to them because they really care about you a lot. For example, what happens if you are in a bad situation like being chased by a stranger and you told your friend to call 911 because you are being chased. The police got there in time to arrest the stranger who was chasing you. You see, friends care about you and for your safety as well.

Your friends will always got your back no matter what happens to you or them.

Your friends just want to hangout with you have fun .

The second reason you need to be honest is with your family . You got to be honest with your family because you got to tell them the truth of what is going on in your life. What happens if your Mom or Dad are calling you while you are walking to school with your ringer cut off. They just checking on you and for your safety. Your does not want you tell them lies cause sometimes kids do not want to tell their parents what is going on in school. You never know when they are getting bullied and being harassed.

The lesson of the story is that always be honest and tell the truth with your family.

The third reason you need to be honest is with yourself at all times. You have to trust yourself because you never know what is going to happen to you. For Example, someone is selling drugs in school and he told you that you want some drugs . You have to think is this going to kill me or just say no. In my opinion I would say no to person who is selling the drugs. This actually can happen in real life . If you were in that position just say no or make an excuse . The lesson of the story is always be honest to yourself. ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,7.0
50419253BA19,"Should take classes like music,a drama,or an art class be required? Although some say that arts class should not be required,actually it should because students can develop talents and also it can help students to lost some stress. In addition, students will find a fun way to be less stress. I am agree with the assertion that student should be required to take an arts class.

Those who believe that arts class shouldn't be required they have their reasons. For example they believe that students may not like the class assigned and they also think that it can cause that a student may start cutting his classes.

From my perspective I believe that arts class should be required to students because they can develop talents. I believe that because when I was in my country there was one private high school that was located at my city,in that high school all students were required to take an arts class and nevertheless some of them knew how to pain,act,and sing and they were so talented in any arts class that they were taking. Also in my country every year there is a competition that call the most talented students from the country, this competition only awards students that are very talented in arts class such as pain,act,and sing an the students that just to go to the high school that was in my city they frequently just to take first place in those competitions and that's why I believe that that arts class should be required for students it will help develop talents.

From my point of view, I think that arts class should be required because it can help students to lose some stress. I believe it because like a student that I am every time when I get off from my Algebra 2 class I am always super stress,but after that class I have the art class. In that class I always lost all my stress when I start drawing things even though I do not how to draw but it help me a lot to keep my main clam. Also why I believe that arts class help students to be less stress is because the environment in the class is always nice,and the students are always focus in the things that they are doing without making to much noise and that is why I believe that arts class should be required to help them to don't be stress the all day in school .

To summarize students should be required to take arts class because they can learn to do other things that other people can't do and also it can help them like a way to feel better after coming from other class that was awful.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,6.0
9A1F733B06A2,"People who always listen to others get the courtesy to stop listening to their advice and then they start to get mad. Not listening to others could also lead to a bad thing because you might not need an advice now but later on in the future that advice would be useful. Their advice could become extraordinary but sometimes the person's mind starts to think of something else. People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes matter.

To begin with, a couple years ago when learning about life your going on road trip with father. You see the last gas station but think that your 1/2 gallon tank is going to last you. In addition, your father tells you to fill up your tank but you don't listen. When you see no gas station and the notification to put gas comes on your father reminds that you should've listen to him. After that moment you have learned some expierence. To continue, You also learned that people more older than you have more expierence.

Next, you have trouble paying your house or apaertment. For example, you don't know what to do, so you ask your friend, parents, and family. Further, you start to look at your debts with your father or mother, but everything is fine. Then they look at what your spending your money in and then they see that there is your problem. You start questioning them how can you stop. Your parents start responding to you how you can fix your problems. Moreover, they start by telling you that all left over money should be put in a savings account. People who have trouble have parents or friends as experts who know what to do.

Although, you're buying a used car and don't ask too much details about the car you just like the exterior and interior. You think that you know a lot about cars. When the first few weeks with the car we're fine but then the car starts to rumble and shakes out of know where. Furthermore, you remember that you have an uncle who is a mechanic. You go to your uncle's workshop and you see your dad there. Your dad starts lecturing you about how not to buy cars from sketchy dealerships. Also, your uncle interupts and informs you that the whole car system is broken and there isn't anything he can do but selling it to a junk yard. People who think they know what to do end up doing something bad.

To sum up, people think to ask for help is a bad thing. Asking for help isn't a bad thing but taking advantage of it is. I give some few examples how people forget or don't know how to use help. Sometimes its important to be independent but not all the time when you have a doubt. ",4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,8.0
20C2264E6ED2,"Everyone has their own talent and we all have unique talents, like for example singers, dancers, artists and more. My talent is singing and how I develop it is by practicing and working hard, and how I use it is, it can help me figure out my situation. how I found my talent was when I was in 4th grade, there was a choir club and they performed to our class. I thought they sounded incredible and it looks really entertaining, then I decided to join the club.

How I develop my talent is by practicing. Every Wednesday I would practice singing with my teacher so she'll tell me which ones should I need to work on more. I would also practice at home by myself so I could improve. One more thing what I like to do to practice is every weekend my friends and I would go to a karaoke and sing, not only this is a blast but it can also help me practice too.

Like any other kind of talents you've got to work really hard. In choir every time we would sing it would take some time and energy, and whenever we make some mistakes we have to re do it again until we make it right. If I don't try my hardest I am not going to be better. If I really wanna get better I really need to be focus.

How I use my talent is, when I'm in a situation that would help me. Like for example if I don't have any job, singing could be my job in a future. When I need money, I could get in a singing contest and win a prize. There's a lot of situation that could help me by using my talent.

In conclusion how I used my talent and how I got better, is to never give up easily. Try fix your own mistakes you'll get better and get as much help if needed. Your talent can solve your problems too. Keep practicing because practice makes perfect. ",3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,7.0

To be yourself makes you ten times happier than being someone you don't want to be. For example, if like going on adventures and society says that it's not a good idea. You should go for it because that's one thing what describing you. Not being happy can affect the people who surrond you. Also, can affect your lifestyle because you can start off in the morning in that great mood knowing you are going to do the things you like. Instead, waking up in a bad mood and knowing you going to do what others want you to do.

It has been proven when you are under pressure to be acting like someone that you are not you will get frustrate, mad, or stress. Being stressed out is not good for our health which has been scientific proven. There is time when you feel like that you make wrong decision; however, that is not always the case. Majority of the time people go to the wrong path; therefore, they can get the things easy and make it seem like they accomplished it by working hard.

You should alway proud of who you are. Not everyone is going to agree with you or like the same thing as you do. However, you should always express yourself in any type either with action or verbalize. As long as, you're happy and love yourself thats all that matters. Do what you like to do,

speak how you want to, or dress how you want to as long as yourself. Not what others want you to be.

Being yourself should be important and the biggest accomplishment in life. You should never let anyone change you or you change yourself for anyone.

004AC288D833,"Dear Principal,

Our school should have a community center. The reasons why, are so students can learn what our community needs, how to make our community better place, and why is community important for students to know. Its a great to have a community center to know how we can make things better.

Students think community center takes their time away. but they have to learn what our community needs. students will participate in a group of students making a list what our community needs, therefore students will learn what our community needs! students will present their list of things our community needs! due to that students will be giving extra credit for the ones who have low grades!

Some students don't participate because their friends say its waste of time. it would not be waste of time when you get to know how our community can be a better place for us. students should know that the program is about our own lives, because if our community is bad well our lives are going to be bad. due to that students will want to participate and will want to make our community a better place for us.

some student might say why is the community important anyways, were fine nothing is wrong. but when get to know what our community is, they would want to know about and would want to participate and know why is our community important. students will receive a good grade if they participate in this community because is like an extra credit. due to that their friends would want to enjoy the program because their friend told them about it.

so principal the community center will be a great place for students to learn lots of things. so i guess this will be a good idea for our school. students will learn what our community needs, how to make our community a better place, and why is our community important!

DF67F209E85E,"I'm totally agree with Thomas Jefferson. As we knew for many reasons being inactive in any time even when you do nothing is not good for humans. system of body of a human organized that should always be active. being inactive dose not make our life easier in case to make it easy we should do how much we can and don't put today's work for tomorrow. for living our life and reach our goals and what we want we should always work for it.

human's body system organized like it always needs to be active, because the energy that we take during the day by eating, should be consume. Even if we set all day and eat and do nothing our body know how to work but it will use as much as it needs and if that energy is more than what body system needs in order to do the work, can cause problems like over weight. even though over weight is big problem by it own, it can cause many more problems for our body's and can effect our health like: diabetes, heart attacks, blood fatty cells, blood... digest system problems and also it is clear that people who are not active and they do not do so much,have less relationships with community and this kind of people mostly have spiritual problems like depression. And their inactivity is not because they have depression but they have depression because they are mostly inactive.

Loqman Hakim (afghan scientist) wrote,""Don't be inactive ever there are always things to do, and if there was nothing to do; shake your head and sing with yourself.""

being inactive dose not make your life easier you should do as much you can and you should never put today's work for tomorrow. One of the most popular thoughts is,""if you want to change the world change it today hare might be no tomorrow."" As much as you do that much you'er work will go forward but if you think by letting the day go on by it own and still every thing will be fine or at least nothing will be wrong, you thought wrong, because as we said inactivity is a big problem by it own.

All Humans in there life have goals to live for, things that they want, and destinations to reach. These goals, thing, and destination are what make life and make people to live. And never anyone in this world could reach them with setting and looking at them or thinking about them all day. For have what you want you should rise and stand and do what you have to. Work for your life. As much as you work that much you are close to your wants as much as you are active that much you are confident. dont ever give up it's your life to live dont spend it with inactivity.

however some people believe that inactivity is good and useful as break after a long period of working but they are completely wrong a break after working is not about inactivity it is about doing what want and having fun the way you like after a long period of job or school work. inactivity can never be fan, or break, or vocation. if you want to take break or because you are tired of working please don't chose inactivity as vocation it will never help you to relax or take away your tirednis, it will make you more tired. You can chose a book to read you can dsaid to travel you can go to a vocation with your family and friends.    ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,6.0
99031AEAD3EE,"Do you have a specific talent or skill ?

In my opinion my best talent is swimming because , I get to learn new tricks in the summer time . My second reason is that you can hold you breathe under water that one is the most challenging one for me , My third reason why I love swimming is that you can be the only one their if your're like a person like me who is shy. My fourth reason is that some of the swimming coaches help you build up your confidence and help you achieve many different goals. My fifth reason is that if you are an upcoming swimmer don't let people over ride you .

One of the reasons why i love swimming is because you get to learn new tricks in the summer time. Each time when you swim you learn something new in swim class you always feel acomplished, no one shames you when you make a mistake .Even though sometimes the trick in very difficult you can feel in your soul that you are going to hurt your self but at the end of the day you feel that you can do anything. One of my favorite tricks are jumping off the stand and putting your self in a position your comfortable with.

My second reason is that you have to hold your breathe no matter what trick you are doing that is the most challenging part for me since i have asthma so i need my inhaler with me, when i go swimming at the beginning when i started all of this i was not determind to do it i was so nervous something might happen to me but my coach Generic_Name said""Don't never ever give on your self no matter what it is "". So had a little faith in what she was telling me .So went under the water for about 10 seconds and for once in my life i was so happy with myself .

My third reason is when you are a person like me if your shy and don't feel comfortable when people are looking at you .You can go to this private swimming area where you can display all your tricks the judges who are judging you .In my opinion i think that is a great idea for a lot of swimmers that are in my position as i write to you don't always have to be where a lot of people are and some people in the audience might be making fun of you and laughing at you and you don't know why they and in your heart feels so crushed inside and saying to my self what can i do better .

My fourth reason is that all of the coaches in all catagories can help you build up your confidence during judging time and all the time they will always make you smile cheer you on everytime ,even if you're in a bad mood that day they always fill up the room with a smile that is what i love about swimming classes . At the end of the day they leave a note that says to me that""You are the most sweetest person we know you are the most kindest,respectful,diligent person god bless you"".

My fifth reasons is that when youir becoming an upcoming swimmer never give up on your self as what my coach said be brave and don't let anyone put you down that you can't do anything because you are amazing just the way you are.

F53E50C57938,"Technically, students spend seven hours in school and seventeen hours at home regardless of what time they sleep or what they do when they get home. Students should have more time to study at home, rest and prepare for the next day. More hours in school will ware out the student causing it to effect their grades. I disagree with the school board's plan to extend the school day because students have extracurricular activities to do when they are not at school,and it disturb both the students and the teachers personal life.

Not all activities student perform happens in school. Adding an hour and a half to the school day can affect the student progress at home. For example, a student can be a player in a local soccer or basketball team, adding more hour will give the student less time to practice and get ready to the game or match and the student will also have little time to do his/her homework or complete an assignment or project given to them. The student having less time to practice is going to take a big tow on his/her team. Maybe the student is a very good player and his/her team needs him/her,he/she having small time to practice will make the team lose the match. This decision will not only effect the student but the teachers too.

Everyone wants to go home and relax from a long day work. The decision of adding ninety minutes to the school day is going to interrupt what the teacher and student do in their everyday life. Some teachers have families they have to take care of. They may have to pick their child or children from the babysitter, preschool or school if the don't use the bus. They also have doctor or dentist appointment they have to attend or have to take their children to. Teachers have chores or duties they must preform at home like shopping for groceries or picking little brother or sister from school. It could also be that they have another place to work at after school in order to earn more money. Both students and teacher have busy lives this decision is going to effect them.

There are many reasons why adding one hour and a half is bad but these are the ones I could come up with. I disagree with the school board's idea to extend the school day because students have extracurricular activities to do when they are not at school,and it disturb both the students and the teachers personal life. I think if the school board is going to add more time to the school they should high the pay of the teacher because it take time off their schedule.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,8.0

BF580042A644,"The city council is debating on having curfews for teenagers, weekdays they have until 10 p. m and on the weekends they have until midnight. This is for the teenagers to be safe and not be out late because something could happen to them if they are out on the streets at night. This rule would be an outstanding one because they can cause less trouble and they can stay out of trouble at the same time. This rule won't interfere with young peoples life, it would keep them safe at home and their parents don't have to worry about them doing anything bad. The teenagers can be talking to their friends, loved ones, and family on their phone or be playing with them on PlayStation or Xbox.

My first reason why I think they should the adopt the curfew rule is because it keeps them at home and keeps them safe. For an example, if your teenager stays home and doesn't go out passed his curfew then he or she won't get hurt or even worse shot by a dangerous person . If the city council adopt the curfew rule they can prevent your son or daughter from getting beat up or getting shot . This rule can prevent anything dangerous happening to your son or daughter, this will keep them inside and they can study, catch up on miscomplete assignments , and do homework. You won't have to worry about them that much because you know they are safe at home and won't try to get you in a serious problem. It's also your job as parents to keep watch out on your son or daughter because they can try sneaking out. The city council can't really do anything about your teenager sneaking out from your house so you are responsible for watching your kid.

My second reason why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule is to keep your teenager from breaking the law and to keep them from doing horrible things. To demonstrate, If your teenager is not out on the street then he or she can be drawing or painting on paper instead of doing graffiti on building or walls . This could prevent teenagers from getting in trouble and prevent people from cleaning up the teenagers own mess. If you have talent to draw amazing objects then try showing it in school or on your personal items and not on the cities property. I suggest buying a ton of paper or objects that you can paint on instead of doing graffiti on buildings or walls own from the city council. If your teenager is caught doing this , he or she is gonna be in a serious problem and they will have to clean it.

My final reason why I think it's important to have a curfew rule is because this will prevent your teenager from doing illegal things such as drinking or doing drugs. We don't know what our kid could be doing passed curfew so I think we need this curfew so we can make sure they are not doing anything illegal. This keeps our kid safe and also out of trouble because its horrible to be drinking and doing drugs. For an example ,If your teenager was caught doing illegal things and doing it passed curfew , it would be extremely terrible and your teenager would be in a whole lot of trouble. This is why having a curfew and checking on your kids room once in awhile will help you prevent this from happening and also keep your teenager from having a black out, crashing or a overdose. If your teenager has some bad friends, tell your kid to stop talking to them because they might try forcing him or her to do something that they do not want to do. Instead of doing those things , just talk to your loved ones, friends, and family on the phone or play with them on PlayStation or Xbox.

As a result, having a curfew on weekdays and weekends is important because this could prevent anything from happening to your teenager. I do not think they interfere with young peoples life but keep them safe from anything happening to them , keep them from breaking the laws and getting in trouble by the police .My three main reasons from having a curfew were to keep them from doing anything illegal, to keep them from getting hurt or killed,

to keep them from doing graffiti on buildings and walls, and makes the parent communicate with the teenager and see what they are doing .One last important thing is to always communicate with your teenager because they want your help but deep down they won't ask for it , so it's important to check up on them once an awhile and see how they are doing.

This is why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule . The curfew rule is an outstanding rule and I think more city councils should adopt it as well.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0
A42A8E5FA4CD,"""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you someone else is the greatest accomplishment.""-By Ralph Waldo Emerson. Some people try to accomplish themselves to demonstrate that they not need someone else to be successful. Some people believe that believe in themselves is more accomplishment than believe in another people. Those people who believe in individuality became more independent. In addition for some people to be themselves is the most greatest accomplish because people learn how they can value for themselves and demonstrate that they can be something else without help of someone. Some people rather be individuality because they didn't like the opinion of others.

To begin with, People learn how they can be value for themselves. For example, ""those people who decide to marry and separate from their actual family, during time they become learning to how survive with out help of their family and they willing that they can value for themselves."" Some people demonstrate that they are independents for their actions. To be ourselves teach as how confront our mistakes and how to process them.

secondly, Be individual make people more believable in themselves. For instance, ""When people make thing for themselves they believe in them and being positively."" Some people believe that is more better be individuality because they believe in what they do that what the others' do. Some people be individuality because they are more believable for themselves. Those people who are believable in themselves are people who truly want to be successful in their life because when people are individuality they do things for their own and they realize that they are not depending for someone.

In the other hand, some people argue that is not good idea to be individual. Those people believe that be individual is a bad idea because they say that two person have more ideas than one. However, that is not true because be individual make's people to believe in themselves and also is the greatest accomplish to keep believing than what others' believe for us. Be individuality make people more believable in their selves and be positive in their own decisions.

In conclusion individuality make people be themselves and they can effort to be the greatest accomplishment. Being individuality people became to learn many things. Some people effort to do their best and not be dependent for someone. People do not need be with a partner to demonstrate that they can do many things for themselves.",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0
D760EF65B80C,"Many people think that it is a great idea for high school students to only attend three years of high school education, by taking courses in the summer or in the evenings, It will allows you to graduate a year earlier than your orginal class year, I prefer to attend all four years of high school education, which means that i would attend all four traditional years of high school education, such as: Freshmen year, Sophmore year, Junior year, and Senior year, which is the last year of a student high school education. The reasons for my disagreement are: Age problems, Graduation issues, Lack of Experience, and Shortage of a summer break.

Firstly, lets talk about age problems that people who follows this plan are going to go throught. Freshmen students should be starting thier first year of thier high school career around the age of fourteen or fifteen years old, So they can graduate while turning the legal age of eighteen years old in the United States, Which is the correct age of finishing thier high school education. Sophmore students should be starting thier Sophmore year while turning the age of sixteen years old. There are few students that start thier Sophmore year at the age of fifteen years old, Which means that they attended thier first grade in Elementry school younger than others.

Secondly, Graduation issues, Graduation should be the most significant accomplishment in anyone's high school education, When following this program, You are not going to be able to graduate with the same class year as you for example; I graduate with my orginal class of year twenty-twenty. If following this program, you are going to be ahead of your friends and class year.

Thirdly, Shortage of summer, students only get two months as a summer break in the United States, before attending thier next school year. By following this program, you are not going to be able to go on vications and rest from the year that you attended. You must study the classes and cources that the program gives you, so you can finish all of your credits and graduate while your family are on vications having a good time.

Finally, In conclusion, this program will mess up your summer plans and would not benefit you with any new progress. I suggest the traditonal four years of high school education.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,7.0
6269A525D482,"I think it is a good idea because students might be tired of working at school everyday. Lets say that students want this the same school schedule that has a longer winter break, a year-round schools, and a week off in the spring and fall because people want more time to do spend time with family, do homework, projects etc...

First, We can spend time with family and friends, we can watch a movie with them, eat food together as a family, have parties and celebrate at our house. We need families to stay together as a group because if we don't then we are going to miss them too much as we go to college or get our new place to live. Nobody wants to stay alone because if they want to stay alone that's okay if you want.

Second, We can go on a vacation to the beach, the pool, Disney world etc... I love going to the pool in the summer because we don't have to stay at our house all day and all night. There is so much to do outside then just staying inside and doing nothing. We must stay with our family because they love you so much and they want to spend time with you too.

Finally, We can relax from work and studying we are tired of working so hard that we need a break. We are studying so hard for school, we did lots of tests and quizzes that we are tired from. We all enjoy summer vacation because we can spend time with our family and friends, we can invite our friends to eat , go to mall, watch a movie etc...

In conclusion, We must spend time with family and friends to go anywhere in the world for a vacation. We can enjoy each other by going to a amusement park or a museum to play and take pictures to save it on our phone for memories. We need to be together as a family, work as a team, having fun on a vacation.

CE43DBA12965,"The growth of technology has made it convenient for people to use anywhere and any time. Technology has made it easier for people to do online education, jobs, and shopping. People are now in favor of this technology growth.

First, online education has made it easier for students to study at home without worrying about how they are going to get to school. I'm in favor of the online education because it made it easier for me to take my online classes at home and I can do my assignment any time I want to do it. The online education is also convenient for students in colleges; most of the students in colleges study at home because they don't have to worry about transportation, nor the gas money for their car. My brother is in college and where he lives they get a lot of snow in the winter, so it make it hard for to go to college. Now he does not have to worry about the weather because he can study for his classes online.

Second, most people are now doing online jobs because the grown of technology. In my opinion the most popular online job is to be a you tuber; a lot of you tubers film their lives and put on the internet then the get money of it. One of my friend is a you tuber and he gets decent amount of money just form putting videos of him self on the internet. The way YouTube work is the you tuber up lodes a video on YouTube and if he gets a lot of views then he gets a lot of money. Another online risky job is buying and selling in stocks. One time I bought an online stock form the company Tesla and it was really good price, after three months I sold the stock double the amount that I bought it in the first time. When people buy stocks from other company is like having a percentage of the company that buyer own. The risky part about it is people never now when the stock will go up or down.

Third, online shopping has made it convent for people to order everything online. The most popular online delivery is Amazon; Amazon made people lives so much easier by having everything delivered to their houses. When I order online I always order from Amazon this company has everything I need for me and for my family. Amazon also has fresh grocery that they deliver it for the costumers in the same day that they order it. In these modern days other stores are now delivering online, so people can buy their needs while they are at home.

Although technology has made people lazy and decreased the communication between humans, but it made easier for student to do their homework, it made it easier for people to make money while they are at home, and it made easier for those people who don't like to do grocery shopping in the stores.

In conclusion the growth of technology has helped a lot of people with their lives including student and online workers. All people are in favor of this amazing growth of technology because it has helped them to make their lives easier. I think that people are going to proceed with growth of the technology because it's making people lives run smoothly.            ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,6.0
AE6AE119B52F,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Students who follow this plan usually take courses during summer or in the evenings. I believe is better to graduate and finish school in three years as maximum. Most people needs to work and support their families as soon is possible. Other people want to finish earlier due the type of careers they are trying to accomplish. In addition, teenagers will have that extra time after they graduate earlier from high school.

There are thousands of people trying to studying and be working at the same time because they need money for themselves or to help their families. For example, I am working at Don Eladios' Cantina, I am a server. I work 5 days a week, but I really do not have the enough time such as attend school and have a job, I mean I have it, but is really hard and I am not making the necessary money I need to pay even the basic because is not a full work time, It is just a part time so I am trying to finish school as fastest I can.

Some students need extra time because they want to learn more and get a college diploma. They must take high level classes like medicine, science, astrology, psychology, etc. Those classes need a lot of study in order to be completed. Students need to finish high school in a shorter period of time because It takes several years of assisting college if you want to get a higher degree. For example, if you want to be a doctor, It will be necessary to finish school as soon is needed because taking classes as a doctor takes of 4-6 years minimum.

On the other hand, students believe is a good idea to graduate early because they can look for something else in a premature age like sports, music, being an artist, a writer, etc. For example, after I graduate and I get my diploma, then I would like to be a mechanic technician or a soccer player, maybe an artist, because I will have enough time and able to achieve it.

Some people say, that four years of learning, principles, and understanding in high school are essential for the good development of a person. However, they are wrong because you can learn everything and graduate in three years of high school with the same privileges, benefits, and with extra time. Also you when you graduate and have your diploma, there is going to be enough time to work or be a professional person in less time than the common.

In conclusion, to graduate early is the best option if you do not have time, or if you need to work and help your family, or just to be what you want in a younger age.",3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,6.0

A way this can help older students is by actually helping the younger students in need, they can benefit the younger students work while being there and helping them. When an older student has free time, the older student can visit the younger the student if he or she needs assist.

If we have 3-4 weeks breaks in the summer, then we can't enjoy our days and times, we can't play our games and we can't go anywhere. We work really hard for school.

A5DCC6948E4E,"I was surprised when I read an article about Space X, and how they found a revolutionary way to send rockets to space and back to Earth. Space X, a company that did not have experience in how to construct rockets, started from an idea that still today is their main goal, this goal is to make a travel to space accessible for more people and not for just a few. However, a great project requires a great effort and dedication. Space X had many problems at the beginning of the project, the principal problem was how to land a rocket again to use them in future missions, they fail many times losing millions of dollars during the investigation, nobody believed they could accomplish it. Space X, is currently one of most successful companies wining millions of dollars by sending satellites to space. Failure always plays a really important role in the pursuit of success, without failure nobody could learn from their errors, failure is helpful to keep enthusiasm and try to complete it, and failure is really important to keep innovating.

Everybody tries to have success but many have fear on failing in what they are trying to do, people believe that if they try and fail, they will lose something, but the thing they do not think clearly is that if they never failure success will never be in their life. Failure is a opportunity to learn from the mistakes and how to correct them. For example, I had to create a rocket for my science class it was for a final grade, I could not find a effective way to make the rocket work, I was so nervous the presentation day was really close, so I made a prototype of my rocket to see what could go wrong and to find the most effective rocket, the prototype was a complete fail, the rocket not even could go up. I did several errors in my prototype that then I fixed in my final project, the day of the presentation of my rocket everything was perfect, because thanks to the failure I could fix the mistakes and had success in my project. Learning from a failure and knowing how to fix the mistakes is the best way to have success.

Sometimes enthusiasm is the reason why we do things, when somebody is enthusiasm in something, they can try even if they failure and sometimes failure is something that some people can not tolerate and they try their best to reach that goal, people who are really constant and know what they want, they do not fear to things that somebody else could fear. Enthusiasm can make people effort even more for what the want, and failure is the complement of enthusiasm, because if a person failure the enthusiasm to reach that goal gives him motivation to keep trying until reach the goal or success.

Innovation is something that happens every day, a new phone, a new car, all this is part of innovation. companies innovate to keep ahead from others, and some companies failure but sometimes this failure is not bad at all because this companies how failure understand that they were doing something wrong with the direction of the company. This allow them to create new services or products and be in a better track that they were before. For example, a person has a farm that produces only corn during summer, he provides all the stores in the county, but one day the demand of corn goes down and the farmer does not know what to do, he failure with the corn production and needs to sell the farm to pay tax, but then an extraordinary idea comes into his head, why not construct chicken houses and provide that chicken to big companies, the farm will produce more money, and will be a more stable farm. keep innovating even if we failure is the best form to have success.

Failure is one of the things is going to be with us the most part of our lives, the only thing we can do is to learn from it, if we go from failure to failure just be enthusiasm in complete our goal, and keep innovating. Failure is important because it gives us experiences that we will never forget and will help us react in a better form to problem that we could have in the future.

109CBA5203BB,"One thing I would like to do when I grow up is build schools in Sudan. In my home country, Sudan, there has been a lot of conflict with the government and Omar al-Bashir, the president. Due to this, children cannot eat, go to school or have any hope of security. Students can expand their knowledge and make a living after graduation, knowing they have a chance of getting into university and having a good life. The schools will be built in the places where the most people are in poverty. Building schools in Sudan will let the children get the education and security they deserve.

In Sudan, the conflict that rattled the country took a large toll. Since the conflict has started back in 2018, it has kept the same negative energy. Omar al-Bashir was the long dictator of Sudan, and he is the root of this problem. Back in 2018, the citizens began to protest and strike against him, and the teachers and kids would not go to school. And thats when it started. Omar al-Bashirs army threw teargas at protests and in hospitals, shot at the protesters (mostly children and young adults that ranged from 8-27 years old), and kidnapped the leaders and protesters. This resulted in raised prices in food, gas, and goods. To get gas, you would have to wait at least 2 and a half hours. An example of what the raised prices did was that a bag of tomatoes would be 60 Sudanese pounds. The children would be scared to go out and play,go to the mosque and pray, or go to school in fear of what might happen. If I were to build a school, it would be like the ones we have in America today. With security, cameras, quality education, free meals to the kids that cant afford it, and internet. Students will want to come to a school that is well protected, and get the food they need. Building this school will insure their needs.

School can be a place of comfort, education, and fun. In Sudan, the schools there are very... lets say, bland. all of it is just about learning and reading and doing things perfectly without a mistake. they dont have fun activities, or field trips, or projects. I want this school to let the kids learn in a fun way. To memorize their Quran ( the holy book in Islam) in fun ways, like in a short song, since most of the verses rhyme. To learn math with activities and reward them for it. I want to do this so the children dont have to worry as much. so that they can graduate and have a chance at going to university. so they can get a job and know they have a chance at a good life. At this school, they can do after school activities. They can play a sport, or cheer, or make a club. this school can make a difference, keep them safe, and keep them occupied.

The schools will be built in the places where most people are suffering. Like in Al- Obied, Khartoum,Bahri, and Port Sudan. Most of the riots that happened were in Khartoum, Bahri and al-Obied. The kids over here need to be focused on even more, since they have lost the most. These kids mean so much to me because this is where i'm from. If Generic_Name didnt win the lottery to come here, i would have been in their situation. To see that the children of Sudan are suffering because of one person makes me want to help. So the kids in those areas can learn, graduate, get a job, make a living, and feel safe. Building this school is important for the children. To fulfill their needs, and to keep them safe.

So to sum it all up, I want to help the country of Sudan by building schools that have security, cameras, free meals, and internet. These schools can help by keeping the children safe and occupied so they can learn and make a living at the end of the day. With exciting activities and projects, the kids will have fun there. The country of Sudan needs to see that the children are the future, and taking care of them is a must. This is so very important to me because my country can thrive and the children can succeed. These schools can change Sudan for good. I can make a change, once and for all!",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.0,8.0

Can do what it wants if try and try, so let me tell you something about a friend that is close to me, and he was in failre to failure, so one time he came to me and he told me his problems, and than he cry and I tell him, ""don't worry everything will be okay"", and than he said - I'm gonna try again this is the second time that I failure, and I will try again until to have what I want, and I tell him that I always will be there for him, because he is my friend and the friend is to be there for each other when it need, and then two years later he told me that he finally has what he was trying to do in the pass and he was very happy and I was happy too. If my friend didn't try he were unhappy, and maybe he were a miserable person, but he were strong and he did it.

do you know ""what you can do with effort"", means? effort is something that it has to be preasent in your life everything is made it with effort, when I was 14 years old I was in my country, I was in 9th grade, and my friends and I was happy for our graduation, but I was acared because we had a final exam and the exam was about my country history, but is not that simple because I had to know a book of 6 parragraph, and some of the parragraph is like 10 sentences each, and I had to tell to the principal the antire book, so and then I had to learn 50 question about my country that it comes in the book too, so I had to take the test writing about this 50 question, but I already took one and I fail, and I was scared about it, but I tell my self you can do it, you have to pass, and I was studying averyday after school at my home, with my friends, and sometimes my counsins help me how to do it, or they help me to learn; they asking me the questions to know if I knew correctly each question and answer, so the day of the test I was a little scared and nervios, because I feel I will forget everything, and finally it was my turn, and I did it right I was so happy with myself because it was hard, I put all my effort in this test and I did it, and my frinds and I graduate at the same time. If I were lazy and not interest in to pass this exam maybe I had to repeat the school year and I were disappointed with my self.

A failure can be for a better opportunity in the future. Now I come with a anecdote of my uncle Generic_Name that already died he was illiterate, and his job was the security in a night club, and that was his job in his entire life, and one day the boss went with new rules for everyone, and his boss tell him his job

-you have to write the number and the name of the people that come in the nightclub every day, and my uncle tell to his boss

-I would like to do that Sr. but I can not read and write I'm illiterate and I can not do what you are asking for my Sr. his boss tell him

-I'm so sorry Generic_Name but if it is like that you can not work anymore here, and my uncle Generic_Name answer,

-but what I'm going to do I can not do anything else this was my job in my entire life. His boss said,

-I'm sorry Generic_Name. And then my uncle left the place he was upset telling to himself what I'm goin to do I need a job, and he remerber that he fix the chairs of the night club, and he said

-I can do that in the town and earn some money just for my food , and he went to his house and find some nail and tools, but that was not anough, and he had some save money and he went to the city to buy what he needs; the way to get to the city was two days in mule and when he come back to the town the next day his neighborhood went to his house and told to my uncle

-you have a hammer that I can borrow,

and my uncle tell him

-Yes! but I can't borrow you my hammer, because I need it I have to work, and his neighborhood said

-Please I can bring you tomorrow in the morning,

and my uncle puzzling said

-Ok!

At the next day his neighborhood tell to my uncle

-where did you buy this hammer because is really good can I give you the money and you can go buy other one for you,

and my uncle said

-well it's okay I'm going tomorrow in the morning,

the other neighborhood knew that he will go to the city to buy some things and they ask if he can bring things to them, and they will pay extra money, and he tell them

- okay no problem I'm come back in two day then he were thinking about how he will earn money doing travels to the city, and buying things for the other people in the town, so he decide that will be his job and than he did it, and earn enough money that he ask to the store but a truck come to drope the merchandise to his house, and like that he were improve his little store in the town than he remerber one of his friend can make tools and like that they fabricate the tools and they find more people to make it too, and little by little he make a a big hardware it was the first hardware in the town; the day to open for the first time his hardware someone ask him to sing in the book and he said

- I would like to sing, but I can not read and write, and the man said

- WHAT! I can not believe that Sr. if you made this factore been illiterate what would you do if you could read and write, and he asnwer maybe I keep my old job and I still were a security of a night club. if my uncle didn't try to find some job for himself he didn't reach all the he had at that time.

Success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, so you never have to forget about the enthusiasm because if you do not motivate yourself you never will get what you want, what you wish, your dreams, and the best way to reach all of this goals is with enthusiasm.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,6.0
753391D5E480,"I would have to agree with otherwise you try to do something in other side what you have is already mastered, you will never be successful, because whatever you have in your life is still nothing you should have a specific goal for you future, enough confidence, and demonstrated yourself.

Everyone should know what he/she want to be so they must prepare them selves for what they need to be, like working hard in order to achieve development in there ways. I want to tell about my friend Generic_Name that he is an engineer, he use be one those people that they think they can't do any thing in lives to find the way of success but he went for it to get it, thats way he is an excellent example for me. That makes me feel like it is your life, it is your choices just find it out whatever you want.

I think whoever believed to themselves and to the ability that they have they defiantly feel more strong in there goals. Also every one knows that when you have a problem do not complain just ask for help like me, when I was in Tenth grade I had a lot of issues the most important one is the school that I don't want to be in school because I feel that is just not going to work for me but I was wrong because I did ask for help from my teachers they provide me very helpful in formations. Some people might disagree with with me because they think asking for help can't solve all of the problems, but they are wrong because everyone need help no one is prefect.

As we know to confide in your self you need to toil hard a lot and you must tolerate more trouble that they are coming in your way. Of cores noting is easy but also is not that much hard that you should give up for it, so the more education that you have the more happier you will be in the future like my favorite soccer player Ronaldo he had a very hard live but he did find his goal and now he demonstrated him self to everyone.

In conclusion whoever try to do something in the lives like working hard on there goals, having enough confidence and tried to achieve them they well be successful. We all should believing to ourselves and use our abilities in right ways if there is a wish, there is a way for it.              ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,6.0
47DCB7763FF9,"Schools who partnership with other companies allows students to explore the world through internships and get a chance to discover if they like it or not. What they want to do in future? Schools should partnerships with companies because it helps students to know what's best for them for example, what they are interested in, get opportunities to explore the world, and helps students to communicate with others.

One reason why it's beneficial for students is that they get to know what they are into. If students get a chance of this internship, it allows them to work with other people. When they'll work with different people with different cultures, it will let them know how to work and handle other people. They'll be able to do what they want to and they'll have an experience too. There are many students who don't know what they want to do or what they want to be. Joining this internship will help them to work and decide what is best for them. Many times they don't get an opportunity to know what they would like to do. There are many students who would just take any class with their friends even if they don't like because they are in difficult situation and don't know what they want to do. So, they just decides to go with friends and have an experience if they like it or not. Later on they quit that class because they feel it's not what they like. It also is a trouble for school counselors because then they have to change students schedule which is very trouble making sometimes. On the other hand if they get a chance through internship it will help them for sure to know what they are interested in. So in the future they won't get confused what they wanted to do but didn't get an opportunity to know.

Next reason is that students get so many opportunities to explore the world. It is very difficult or close to impossible that students get a chance to learn about the world. This is great to explore the world and learn new things which many students want, but bad luck not everyone get to explore. Exploring the world or learning new things is really good for students. It allows them to know how the world is and what they can get in future working with other people. Getting an opportunity from this internship is very beneficial to explore the world because this makes students know how to work with other people. It helps them to learn about different cultures and make new friends. When they explore the world they can get to learn new languages which makes so much easier for students to get job anywhere they want to. If they know different languages people will accept their application for internships or for jobs. In United States, most of the times people look for students who speaks more than one language because it helps them to make their companies more effective in good way. Students don't hesitate to talk to others, especially when they know so many different languages which makes them feel they can achieve anything they want to.

Last reason is that students will be able to communicate and understand how is it to talk with others from this internship. It happens most of the times students might know so much about what's going on but they don't get to talk. There is a reason they don't talk with others is that they feel shy or are not confident on themselves. If schools let them go or participate for internships it will allow them to become more confident. When students will get an internship to work and talk with other people they won't feel shy anymore and will feel confident by practicing.

Communication is the most important part of our lives if students don't talk they won't understand what's happening, which can destroy their school lives. In schools or outside the schools, communication skills must be best to improve yourself. If students don't communicate they don't get ideas or don't really learn new things. Communication allows students to get the chance and gives them right to speak. When they will speak they'll feel confident and won't care what other thinks.

Many people argue thats it's not great for some students because it already have so many things to do like they have games or jobs after school. However, if schools have partnership with different companies this could be the best opportunity for students to experience what they are interested in, discover the world, and become confident and communicative. This will make students know that they can do what they want to.

In conclusion, by working with other companies will help students to make their decisions more confidently and not to feel shy about them. It also could help them to know what they wanna do in their lives. This partnership allows students to learn new things and languages which I think is very difficult without internship. I think students should get this internship to help and improve themselves.",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,6.0
784F11A6D9E7,"I remember when i live in Generic_City my mom call me loook in the phone they live far away because they live here in United States now call alone my brother every day because he have internet all time .

The issue is whether because the people now the technology the children lay game, and affect the rain the children because the children look the phone or tablet or other thing more they need look every day is noo good for children.

I dissagree because the techology now affect the children they need read the book or play with the toys they not affect the eyes the children now for the technology more children need glasses for look can the things every day.

The first reason: the children they need play because he is boy is little he no can look the phone tis affect other things the children in the phone for the technology now has bad plays the children to lose in the home for play and call for they go in outside for one toys the children they dead in the place where theys call. For example: My little brother have one phone he no talk with you he play in the phone one play is bad the play say go in outside thi is affect my brother the technology now is not good.

The second reason: the technology is more the technology for the people because they no used the phone normal because they has bad things this is affect the people need for a emergency they no have for emergency the text every day and all night they no cn sleep the need phone ecause hthe phone has more technology they look very day they need one limit for free time. For example: My sister all time has en this phone and affect she no can look far because the technology she affct other things .

The third reason: the affect is no have the limit you need because we are need more time for read an other things you need less the technology is affect you brain, and eyes this affect the people no speak with another person ecause they need text or look video they no have free time for his children. For example: My aunt no have time for your son she only speak in the phone and work she every day speak in the phone and no have time because we are look the cousin.

They people say disagree because is not good the technology ecause is affect more people they no want the achieve nothing in your life because has the technology they na have nothing for all time no have work they have phone because is affect the people no have time for speak with family the technology is more affect the people iis not good for all time you have the technology is affect the drean that have each person and lose the friends no want go to the store.

571F79B234CE,"Extending school day two more hours?

this maybe will be a good idea, extending the class or extending the school day and we will have only four day,sound great but the true maybe will be for many reasons some good,some bad.

Now we can see about the students and their work,their effort each day, for they go to the school each day for the regular hours, many many students need maybe more hours for rest why? because many of them do not have maybe parents with them now,

many of them maybe their parents don't help them, so they need take a work for the night and that is so hard, i can say that why? because i am one of them, because when i come to the school each morning, for me is hard, is difficult, cause with many classes. with many homework, with many things that i need to do, many time i can't sleep the correct or appropriate time for that, because after my job i need to do my homework and i think so, that two hours more for study that's for me, bad idea i know that that will be only two hours more and only four day. But this too is a good thing for many people, students just only four day for each week sound too great,for many reasons the benefits is that we will have three day for rest, three day(Friday, Saturday and Sunday)for include for work but what about students that work? what about their parents?.

Some disadvantages about this is that the students will don't have extra time for their activities, maybe they will don't have that correct time for sleep,but that will be a good idea for everybody include teachers, only the plan for work that need change in the school maybe in those two hours more, the school's team of work need implement activity's hours. that idea of course will conserve resources, because the water that, students use: for drink, for the bathrooms, for clean their hands and include for the people that work in the kitchen or cafeteria, that use for clean the thing,that they use for cook that will be savings many resources, many things for clean,so that will be good about the resources water, food, include thing that students use in the library.

6A93CA2C5D9C,"Prompt- Former British prime minster winston churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to faliure without loss of enthusisam."" Do you agree with the statement hemad.

Yes, i agree with what he said the thing is true fact thing. Winston churchill is a very succes full men he knows what he's talking about or he been everywhere around the world. He knows a lot failure feels like cause he had a lot up and downs in his life. There is 3 things i agree with him. The First thing i agree with him is that if you don't have failure thing's in your life you not going to succesfu. The second thing ls that failures gives you a lot movation to push your self then other times. The third thing is that failure will show you how the world is what i mean by that is that people in this world will hate on you until you die. All this three thing this why i agreed with Winston Churchill.

I beleive been Faliure will make you succesful if you keep working hard and puting in the time. I rember i was watching Youtube video like three moth ago it's true story. There was this kid named Generic_Name. Generic_Name was born in early 90's. When he was little kid he had gotten effiction from something after he got the effiction he was hurt he wasn't feeling good. After week he try cut his handoff and his mom caught she asked him ""what are you doing"" He said ""my hand hurts i c'ant take it no more"". The next day he went to the doctors and got his hand cut off. After while he start playing the sports he loves football. The coach told him he can't play cause he dosen't have a hand but his brother was playing with him on same team. On that day both of them quit and went to diffrent team they played there for 2 years. After two years there were in high school they were monster. They were the best players in the state. Senior year came both of them gotten offer from UCF. Fresh man year in college Generic_Name didn't get playing time sphomore year came he still didn't get playing time. UCF head coach got fired his end of sphomore beacuse they had bad record the past 2 yeras. Junior came he started on Defense he was monster fast eaxpolisve he was insane. End junior his brother got drafted to the NFL. Senior year came he did that same thing again he was inane. The past 2 years he started the team won 28 game lost 0 games. In 2018 NFL Draft he got drafted to the same team where his brother got drafted in. When he was young his didn,t belive on him and told him he cant,lt play the game cause he dosent have a hand. The coach told him he's going to fail playing football but he did'nt cause he kepet working hard every day. The second thing was failure gives you movation Generic_Name got his movation from failng and coache's didnt beleive on him but he fought all that thing to be come who he is today. The third is that in this world every one is going to hate on you no matter what you do like Generic_Name some coaches freinds hated him cause he didn't have a hand he didn't care what people going to say abouth he just work hard and put the time in no matter what. His parents should be proud beause who bcome to be.

Yes, i agree with what he said the thing is true fact thing. Winston churchill is a very succes full men he knows what he's talking about or he been everywhere around the world.

The success of life to fall down is important , because with enthusiasm you can do everything, that you would like for your future, still if you fall down. Life in this world is hard to get up, but be strong person with enthusiasm, your life can be easy and not complicated. To fall down in life, you can have many negatives things in life. Life can be more hard as you think it is. Enthusiasm have many positive opportunities in life. This positive opportunities can make your life more easily, because growing with enthusiasm, your future can have more patient,less stress, and more happiness in your life. To failure without lossing enthusiasm can have the sucess of your future. Bringing success into your life, you can learn lessons, that would help you to find opportunities, for you to walk forward. In this statement I agree with mr, Winston Churchill, because this is a every important role statement, that can help people to bring the positive way for making easy life for people in this world.

To fall down in life, you can have many negatives things in life. Life can be more hard as you think. To have better opportunitites, you have to bring that energy to be strong person without giving up. If you want to have dreams, with no enthusiasm it would be hard you to get it. An example"" i want to have the goal, to have this big dream, going to collage."" If you want this dream with negatives thoughts, things without studying, and be lazy to have a job, to safe money for your collage, you can't do anything. Another example "" i want to have a car, a house, a dog, and having a trip everywhere in the world."" You can have a job, but if you are lazy to work, you can get fired, not getting that much money , that you need for all your things you want to have. To have negatives thoughts, you can't have all your things, that you would like to have for a better future into to your life.

To have enthusiasm can bring more easy and posititve thoughts, to accomplish your goals. Because with enthusiasm you can have less stress, you can have more energy, and be patient with everything. To have less stress, with positive thoughts you can make easily things, still If you think that it is hard for you. An example "" i want to pass my sol's in school."" If you want to pass the hardest test in school, to graduated you can study, paying attention to your teacher, do your homework that day is due and having your things on time. You can pass your classes and your sol's, without thinking that much stress in your mind. Another example "" i fell my exam of math class."" You can fell your exam, but you can't give up, because you can have another solution. Teachers give sometimes, opportunities to their students staying after school or come more prepare next time larning a little bit more, because it can be more easily to pass it.

To failure without lossing enthusiasm you can have the success of your future. To have the success into your possitive way, you can have less stress and you can learn the lessons finding better opportunities to move forward. An example "" I did not graduated, because i did not pass one class, it was a requirement for graduation."" It is ok If you did not pass it, but you can have a choice by finding opportunitites in others places. You can repeat school one more year, you can go to other schools that prepare you to pass your exams, and classes, you can go and find information about that class or subject. Another example "" I got fired in my favorite job, because i accidently broke a delicated plate."" You can be sad, but always go and find opportunitties in others places, that can hired you, because if you have experience ready, so it would not be hard for you where to hired you. Becareful what you do, only have the positive way and have the energy, that customers can be surprise about you, how hard you work in your job that you really like.

To fall down can bring you negatives things. Negatives thoughts can bring you in a bad ways, because you want to have that goal that you want to reach, but you can't. This can be a big situation, if you want to reach that goal, but you have to try your best on doing the oppositive way. To have a enthusiasm you can work really hard and make it more easily. Working hard be happy can bring you that attituded, that we all want to see. In this world is hard to bring people in a positive way, because life is hard , but they are people that they want to show that, you can't give up always move forward. To failure without lossing enthusiasm, you can have the success in to your future. This is a lesson that everyone have to follow and not make it hard. If you are negative, just find a way to make you think a lot, because that stress you out and have a negative thoughts, never give up just move forward.             ",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,6.0

In summer we go to different places with my family, we like to travel, we go to crazy water parks, museums, and we go to the zoo sometimes. when you're in school you don't get a lot of time to spend with your family. because you get busy doing your homework and studying.

Summer is the best part of the seasons. in summer is always sunny outside, you can go to the beach, play soccer with your friends and brothers, you can do skateboarding .you can do a lot of things in summer.

881D383DDED7,"Failure as many times we need until to gaing the success

Many people think like Minister Winston Churchill that ""success consist of going from failure to failure with out loss entusiasm"". Most of our famous Scientist and Inventors started like that until they got success. I am agree with his stament because dosen't matter, if we failure always we can learn from our mistakes, believe in our selfs, and reach the goal.

First, reason always we can learn from our mistakes. if we failure in something tried to learn on what we did wrong?. Work hard to do it better. Any failure that we have is an experience that we gaing. We can feel dissapinting from our self, but next time you will do better and better doesn't matter how many times we fall shakes our self and keep going.

Second, reason is believe in our selfs. Failure is just a stop in our way, but good stop because like i said before we can learn from that. We have to believe in us . We need to have faith in what we doing, and nothing can't destroy our goal. Believe that we do it better but never let the deseption influence in our feelings, and never give up in our selfs. The only one thing that we never have to loss is believe in our self.

Third, reason is reach the goal until we have the success. Working hard and what we believe, tried to be better over our mistakes. Never give up even when we thing everything is lost. Nothing can stop us if we always tried to do the things better. Working in our knowledge until to success will be our achievement, and that will demostrate us the we can do anyting even when we failure many times.

Inconclution, success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because enthusiasm is believe in what we are, and what we are capable to do. Not matter how many failures we have our lives we learn from the mistakes that we had. If we work hard to reach our goals until we success that will be our achievement.

BCBD15D06539,"If curfews would have been adopted , teenagers on the streets can keep out of trouble. I agree with this prompt because as a high school student I believe that students or teenagers have a tendency to get in trouble because teenagers tend not to think a head. Teenagers are mostly comfortable at late night because minority of the adults or elderly have had went to bed or working late at night. Also, curfews can help teach teenagers to become responsible , teenagers can often get in fights or in danger when it's late at night because it's dark and hard to see in the night time. It's very hard for anybody to see in the dark when the teenagers get a fight or something else. In August

20, 2018, I have had research about teenagers with curfews in Kid's time it had been said that curfews can be very beneficial to keep teenagers from crimes, danger, and get involve in the wrong of people out in the wrong streets. Curfews can also help teenagers with get a good grade in school by studying and getting assignment done or project done on time , and it also help teenagers with sleeping schedule. If curfews wasn't adopted then a lot of teenagers would cause so much trouble ,danger,and breaking the laws in the towns. Curfews helps save young adults lives or teenagers lives because so teenagers doesn't walking or driving by them self at late night. Teenagers doesn't have to be out and be at the wrong place and wrong time.

In conclusion after all curfews teaches young adult or teenagers to be responsible of managing their time wisely, so that they can be safe ans sound in there homes. Teenagers need curfews to help daily lives the reason why i said that is teenagers have a tendency not to think before hand because I'm also a teenagers and add tending high school. There was one night that when I didn't have a curfew and i was out hangout with friends and there was a test the next day which I have failed because i was out too late and didn't study for the test at all. Curfews help teenagers from the distraction from friend or anyone that's a trouble maker. Being a teenager and not having curfews is very dangerous at night because people getting killed or breaking the laws all the time so for something like that have a tendency to happened in the future. Curfews helps keep teenagers out of troubles or any they may have.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,6.0
32E2949B0C66,"Do you ever want to do something fun at your school that you really like? Well you came to the right school, cause the principal made a rule that you either have to play a sport or join a club that you like.

You could play on a basketball team

You could play on a football team

You could play on a flag football team

You could play on a baseball team

You could play on a softball team

You could play for a soccer team you could join a cheering team

I agree with the principal because, when we get home we don't do anything and kids are lazy nowadays. We either take a nap, eat, watch YouTube, or play video games. Also it will give kids a chance to have fun and make new friends and see what they like so they can do it the future.

So if you don't agree with me, I'll give more reasons like kids are overweight, they're lazy, most of them won't do anything cause they are out of shape. Probably the first thing they do when they get his eat and play video games and watch YouTube. So that is why the principal put in the new rule, they could make new friends while they're after school or join something their friends are in. Also it will be good if your going to play in high school sports cause you already known what it takes to be on the sport team.

It is really fun cause you when you play a game that is home you will feel good cause everyone from your school is there cheering you on. Also if you win your game at home it feels nice cause everyone is cheering your team on and then when you go back to school everyone will be taking about the win. If you don't believe me ask anyone that plays/played for a school team, most likely your parents played for a school team both of my parents did.

If your not interested in sports you could do other afters school activities like

Book club

Yearbook club

Dance club

Cooking club

Computer club

Student council

Engineering club

You could do those clubs in stead of playing sports, You could also do many other things that you like if you don't like any of this thing. Ask your teacher if you could make club and if she says yes go to her office. If you don't like your club cause everything was filled it is fine, cause you could join it the next semester but you have to be one of the first to sign the sign-up sheet. Also you be given a snack at the beginning of your after school period you could choose anything and, if you take the bus it will be there so you can go home.

But if you don't take the bus you will have to be picked up by 4:30 and then you be home and do whatever you want to do. But if your parent can pick you after school you could leave at the normal time school gets out and if your not feeling good you could also leave at the normal time. But before you could anything you have to do your homework and then go to your after school club.

If you don't want to go you will have to go to the principal and explain why you can't, but if it is a dumb reason you will have to go to after school. Like if you have a broken leg and you play on a sport team you could still go to practice and see what they are doing and see al the drills they are doing. Also if you fake an injure and the teacher find your big trouble cause you not listening to the principal. But you could get kicked out if your being bad and you will have to serve a punishment cause your still on school grounds. Like you you hit a student you will get suspended but if you hit the teacher you will get expelled.

If your playing sports it is all year long until the season ends, if your coach finds out your is taking drugs you will get kicked of the team. You will have the same rules as a high school cause you probably play for the high school team. But it won't costs any money cause the principal made us join the clubs so we could do something after school. Most likely we will find our hobby forever cause we are going to do it for the rest of the semester. If you find something that someone is doing and you want to do it just tell the teacher cause they will put you guys together.

If you still don't agree with me you should just try it out cause it fun, You could have fun, make new friends and bond over things you all like. Like sports if you join one of the sport teams you could meet someone with same interest like you. Same with all the other club that the school is providing to the students, like book club you could like the same book as someone else and be best friend over that one book cause you joined the book club. I met one of my best friend through basketball and we liked other stuff that wasn't basketball related.

Most likely you won't like it at first but then when your half-way through the year you will love it. Most of the time I join a club that i like cause it fun to meet new people that have the same interest as you. Sometimes the club isn't fun but that is okay cause you could join a new one. Most of the time everyone will be shy at the beginning cause no one knows each other but half way through the semester you will known everyone. Cause everyone won't be shy cause they will see you everyday plus, when your in school at lunch and you don't known anyone and you see one of those people you could sit with them. When you meet a new person they will have friends so you could more friends when the new person shows you to them.

So what we know is that joining an after school program could give you a lot of benefits and friend. Also they is a lot of clubs and sports you could join for fun. Also eat a free snack so your not hungry when you get home to your parents.

in my personal opinion i do agree that first impressions are almost impossible to change. its impossible to change because thats the very first time you meet someone new in your life. first impressions are very important. there is no way you can change first impressions its not like we can go back in time to switch our answer. making a bad first impression can go very wrong but thats that its done and you cant go back. for example like making a first impression at a job interview like obviously making a good impression is very important if you want a job.

i can also understand why some may say ""almost impossible"" because technechly you kinda can. for example if both of you say ""can we start over"" or something like that. your always going to have that impression from the first time you guys ever meet. so really it goes both ways how someone may take it. i personal dont agree with that because it dosent sound right or feel right. some may move on and ectually forget. while others may not and mentally remmber.

inconclusion it is all based on the reader and how they take it. like i have mention i personal dont think you can change your first impression. we cant go in time and change the past. it donesnt sound reasonablie theres no real reason. some may agree with what i say some may not. then again i can kinda see how someone may want or how to change there first impression.

5AC16E188F1B,"Today technology is arriving into the schools. Some schools offer distance leraning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think that this would benefit students? I believe that it would not benefit students because of technology distraction, student behavior, and the different in capacity and ability for a student to understand things.

First reason, technology is an useful tool that people can use to learn or discover things, but it can be a huge distraction on young people. Today the technology is everywhere and it has everything which make it a powerful distraction for student's. Also, the students can copy any work from the internet while they are taking their online classes. The students will not learn anything if they copy every single work from the internet. Most students on school classes get distracted really easy by something around him, and also get bored when the teacher explain a new theme. I believe that is going to be more bored and distracted being at home alone doing conference and watching videos about the class. My home can distracted me more than my phone or computer, most kids have a video game, TV, family, and so others things that can catch their attention.

Second reason, student behavior can be a problem with online classes. A

lot of students do not respect or listen to their teacher at school, and

I am not wrong thinking that it would be the same at home with online classes. Most of this students do not listen to their teacher because they do not understand the way that the teacher explain or they do not like the teacher. So you can have an idea of how worst it can be i will give you an example, if a student do not like the subject of the day he can easily end the video conference with his teacher or he can just not listen to what he is explaining. The student can also not enter in to the class at the right time. I believe the there should be someone near the student to tell them what to do and how to do it.

Last reason, not all students have the same capacity to understand things. Not all the students have the same capacity to learn or understand by just watching videos or looking at pictures. I am a person who need someone to be physically near by so he or she can tell me how to do things. All the students that have this disability would be affected by this type of classes and this would make them to loose their credit on the class. At the same time this new type of classes is creating a barrier between students, teachers, and school.

Conclusion, the online classes do not benefit students because it can create a barrier between students, teachers, and school. The technology used for this programs can generate a distraction, and that can be a huge problem on future, the environment and behavior of the student can be a barrier too, and the different in capacity or ability to understand things can also represent an huge problem.

I think that this is an good idea because if the school follow this model by extending the school day two hours the benefits are you have more time for study and complete all your work three days to relax in home and do your homework or get a jod and work for three days all this is a benefits.

I believe that with this proposal don't have disadvantages because support all students for more opportunity in the school and be a better student.

F91EFD0443E6,"Have you ever though of people who use technology has limit their communication to others? Nowadays people who use technology are consistent spending their time on electronic device. Technology has a negative impact on human lives due to their daily routine.

The first reason is people's communication skills will decrease over time. Spending a lot of time on technology without comminicating with others, will affect your communication skills. Therefore, talking to someone who you haven't talked with for a while can be awkward. This shows that understanding between two people might have consequence and will be not accurate than it should be.

The second reason, people who use electronic device are unlikely aware of the surroundings. For example, people who are walking in street using headset or earbuds on that cover their ears is a bad choice. This shows a sign of danger, because you won't be hearing anything. People who are aware of surrounding are more safe to cross a street and communicate with people who are passing by. This shows a negative effect of people who block their earing has higher chance to get into a accident.

Some people say that technology helps them communicate by commenting on a website which is true, but that is not important because the person will be not always active and able to comment back on time, whenever they are on. If you are communicate in person you can read the person's mood. You can get a faster respond than waiting for the person to comment back. In this way is more accurate and able to trust each other more by communicating in person that you have meet or have not meet before.

The final reason is library is more accurate than reading books online. For example like reading online recommendation is not always accurate because of the people's preferance. You can ask the librarian for recommendation and librarian also assist you whenever you need help. You can read on your device but it is limited because of the battery. Unlike books, have no battery which means it doesn't have any limit. This shows reading on books is a better than reading on a device.

In conclusion technology had a negative effect on people lives. People should be aware that around them and spend their time in their technology on a necessary way. There should be a limit of how much time you are using on technology. Is better to communicate in person and don't wear anything that cover your ears while talking to someone. This affect our daily lives, so limit the time you use in technology.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,7.0

10B9D8E983B7,"Dear Generic_Name

Shadowing is offered at many schools. It allows students to immerse themselves in the working environment while being seperate from their school work. I am a junior student at Generic_School, i have always been interested in banking since I was young, because one of my aunt have worked in the banking industry for many years. I have the qualifications for this internship for the following reasons: in my math and economics class I have done a phenomenal work in both classes and enjoy them. My aunt have brought me to her work so I could undertand the materials and experience hands on banking, I enjoy challenges and working hard for my goals in life, and one of those goals is to become a banker at your bank. An opportunity like this in your internship program would open up many more learning opportunities than school ever could, and teach me the ways of bankig.

Generic_Name, you should pick me to visit your bank and learn about the day-to-day work for a couple of reasons. I am really eager with this opportunity because it will give me the chance to see if banking is the right career for me. It will also give me the chance to learn what banking is all about. Secondly, I have always been interested in banking because my aunt work in the bank.

I currently have A's in math and economics class, so I have a good understanding of math and economics. I want to meet with you to get a true grasp on banking. I work extremely hard and learn fast, so I will not be a waste of your time.

I think the bank internship would be beneficial for me because I also have experiences working with people and money. As a kid, my grandmother would purchase a lot of candies and chocolate for me to sell at her business office. I would make a poster of what kind and the prices for the candies. The best part for me was talking to people and trying to figure out the right amount of money to give back to the people. I was working and learning how to manage money, which are both things that I have always been interested in. I am extremely interested in banking jobs, and I would much rather be spending my time exploring what I like to do instead of sitting uninterestedly in class. I know that this internship will be an amazing opportunity, and can help me invest in my interest even more,

Teenagers today are sometimes known to be lazy, rude, and unwilling to learn, which is reasonable for any business to decline young prospective interns. Adults and employers both believed that the work ethic of the young community have decreased, however, these negative traits do not apply to all. I believe that I am a hardworking individual with the ability to concentrate at the jobs that I really enjoy. Additionally, the popular view of teenagers, I am mature, and am willing to learn from my mistakes. Allowing me to have this opportunity to be an intern at your bank would enable me to be successful in the workplace.

Generic_Name, this internship would benefit mu future therefore quaranteeing my employment success in the banking field. In addition, I believe that this opportunity could feed my hunger for banking. My experiences, understanding, succeeding in math and economics classes. School is a place where I can only learn about things that do not interest me, but an internship at your bank would expand my mind. Allowing me to get a taste of banking occupation fulfilling my every day ambition

D7817C171926,"Benefits of long summer break

Most students enjoy summer vacation and like to have a fun time. Some students may have more time to share with their family. However some students uses that time to have a job and earn money for any emergency or for keep saving for their scholarships, if they have planned go to the college. I believed that students should have a regular summer break because some students have the ability to remember everything they learned before summer break, and also students may enjoy the weather and have some fun time.

First reason that students should have a regular summer break is that students may be able to develop their strength, while they are enjoying their summer break. For instance some students may have summer school where they could make some extra school's work and keep everything they learned in mind. for instance my family just have time in summer, so I would like to try to do some extra help in summer school, and then enjoy the rest of the summer time with friends and family. also there are a few reason that why students may have a regular summer break. Continuosly I will explain some more reason.

Second reason that students should have a regular summer break is that students may be able to enjoy their break going to the pool, to camp, the river, the beach etc. however students may have also time to study on any subject that they want and have a fun time. Students may have a time for themself, for instance they may sleep and wake up at any time they want, hence they have to clean up their house and give to their family some help.

Also students may study at home with their sibling in case they have, and do some activities to remember everything they learned.

Third reason is that some educators feel that the summer break is too long and because that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. but if educators really knows their students, they may be agree with the regular summer break because that the only time that with have with a good weather to enjoy outside of the house. what about if students have a long winter break, they will not be able to go outside because the snow or for the lowest temperature. what about if students have spring and fall off, also that time of the year is still cold not a lot of snow but cold, students may get sickness or something else. In addition if students need to work because, they do not have the resort or the benefits as another students, they have to work but in winter time in some place of job are not hiring so the could not work in winter break.

In the final analysis some people would argue that students should have three-four week break in summer, a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. however, the summer break is the best time of the year, because students may do something else as play any sports they want, and enjoy that time. Students may have the ability to retain information even after summer break. addionality students would like the advance that they have of having a long summer break and be prepared for the next school's year.

The world sometimes can be hitting you with a basseball bat today and tomorrow giving gifts.

I will always be prepared to what the world has to offer me. my success rate would increase as I'm changing.

E82941E6EE4C,"In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Most students in society think that they might know what their feature career is by just observing the career, and think that it is fun or easy because it might make them feel happy or make them look good.

Although some say that students should commit to career at a young age because students know what they might want and they aren't hesitant,actually committing to a career at a young age allows students to be less committed to a career they want because students are not as focused about their grades,but more about their career they might not want in the feature.

If students are committed to a career at a young age, students will have a hard time focusing in their classes in school and will be more focused on a career they might not want in the feature. Having good grades will help them stay focused and prepared for the career they might want after high school. Developing time to be prepared for their courses in college when in high school is important and it gives students much more time to prepare for their feature career. However,Students shouldn't waste their time on focusing on a career at a young age because they might not end up pursuing that specific career after high school or college instead of wasting their time on a career they might not pursue in the end, students should prepare for their exams and school work and after that they can focus on their feature.

Allowing students to take their time to focus on other things and giving them time to prepare for their career will help them make a right decision instead of rushing into something they might not want. I believe students shouldn't be rushed into things and be given time to understand and know what they might want,If students are rushed they might have no idea as to what they might want to do after,It can be confusing for some people as to why others might rush into things,but knowing what you want is always important and preparing yourself is important. if students are committed to a career at a young age,students might question themselves why they have started this career in the first place and tend to have less interest in finding another career. Majority of people would say they think that students should start a career at a young age because students know what their getting their selves into, they might also say that the students were prepared and are ready to start a career at a young age.

In conclusion,I believe students shouldn't be rushed into things and should be given time to understand and know what they might want,If students are rushed they might have no idea as to what they might want to do after high school or college,It can be confusing for some people as to why others might rush into things,but knowing what you want is always important and preparing yourself is also important. Allowing students to commit to a career at a young age will be hard on them and they will have lots of opportunities to miss out on other careers that are interesting and are good for them,allowing the students to commit to a career at a young age will put pressure on them and have them worried about their careers. students should be prepared and ready for a career that their happy with and a career that they might not question. committing to a career at a young age allows students to be less committed to a career they want because students are not as focused about their grades,but more about their career they might not want in the feature, students will be prepared for a career that is well thought out and planed out.

For example if a students decides to take a class in biology during high school because they might want to peruse a career in the medical field,it will help the student be prepared for what the career opportunities might look like. The student has an idea based on the course they might take to held them further their career. It might not be enough for up to eight classes in high school for them to find the career their interested in. Although some say that students should commit to career at a young age because students know what they might want and they aren't hesitant,actually committing to a career at a young age allows students to be less committed to a career they want because students are not as focused about their grades,but more about their career they might not want in the feature. Students will be more and more prepared for their feature if their not rushed in to it. i believe that students should be given some time to think about what they might want to do after they've finished high school that way they have lots of time to prepared.

some people said that positive attitude can help you in life.

positive attitude is the key to success in many ways in life.

I agree, because in many opportunity that you will have in life, is that you will know a lot of people in life with out positive attitude. One of the most important things that a person can have in life is positive attitude, if you are one of those persons with positive attitude, you will get more opportunity around the world.

In my own opinion positive attitude can help many people out there in life, having positive attitude can help a lot in the person. Example: when you go to work, if you have positive attitude you feel good all the time, also you will be able to talk with your friends in a way that you would not affect someone around you.

Those who have a positive attitude you will success in life. Example in my family, my grandparents has been successful in life only with positive attitude, they always have faith in the things that they will do, also one of my grandfathers said that all you need in the world or in a the work area is positive attitude, if you had that you will get all you want. in many opportunity that you will live in real life, is when you are ready to do something but you are not sure to do it, that's where you will put your positive attitude to do it on own place i would said that having good attitude is one of the best things that a human can have good attitude would give you more opportunity, when someone with positive attitude wake up at the morning the first thing that they do is smile at the mirror.

Positive attitude is a good thing to have but, some people with out positive attitude they think different in a way, that they dont know what are they are doing to be as the person that have positive attitude in life.

In the future positive attitude is going to be one of the most important thing around the world and also in your life.

First, first impression are possible to change when you are making new friends at new school because people can look at you by the way you are quite, shy, and serious. But once they start to get to know you they start realizing that you are talkative, loud, and fun to hangout with. Their first impression of you starts to change. For example, when I met Generic_Name I thought she was ignorant, rude, and selfish but when I started to hangout with her I noticed that she was a sweet and caring girl. And we became really good friends even my first impression of her from the beginning changed.

Second, first impression are possible to change when you go to an interview at work because when you arrive at the interview it may seem that don't have the courage to work by the way you act. Meanwhile those impressions start to change because they notice that you actually want to work and you want to put an effort on the job. For example, When I went to an interview for a job the manager thought that I didn't actually wanted to work and that I wouldn't take it serious just by the way I look. Later on he realized that I actually wanted the job even that I would take it serious. In other hand some people think that by the way I talk or my face impression, people think that I won't get the job because I would not take it serious but they are wrong because once they start to get to know me. They start realizing that I actually want the job.

In conclusion, first impression are actually possible to change when people are making new friends at school and when you get an interview for job because we need to get to know each other better, instead of letting our first impressions be right.

Good morning, we would like to visit your company because we are content to meet and know a little bit more about this job. We also would like you to show us how hard can a real job be. We want to be professional people, what is the why we want you to be our teacher in this new experience. We choose your workplace because we think it is a great place to start meeting about medicine. We would like to be a famous doctors as well as you are. We are also so excited to meet your workplace because some people doesn't have the opportunity to visit you and your clinic. We choose this job because we think it is a great job and also because you can save lives.

It will be a pleasure to meet your workplace. We want to be like you, be a famous person. We also would like to know a little bit more about how to be a fantastic doctor. We choose your workplace because of people told us that your clinic is the most amazing place to have an operation. We are five students that would like to know more about how to be a doctor and how to safe lives. I was thinking about if maybe you may be with us. We are asking if you can allow us to be in a operation with you ,or be watching how do you and the other doctors work in the clinic. We would like to be a great surgeons.

We think that your workplace will be a great starting to know more about how to do an operation. We would like to know how to become a doctor. Your clinic is always clean. We are asking if you can give us the approbation to visit your hospital. It will be a pleasure to meet you and your hospital because we just want to know how do you work, how do you control the clinic, how do you make an operation. We would like to be in an intensive room, even if it can be disturbing. We also choose this kind of job because it is great, even is sometimes doctors have to make hard decisions.

We know a little bit about medicine. We would like to be in your clinic one day because we want someone to show us the materials that the doctors use. In the school we do not have the resources to have these materials. We are actually studying to be the most knowing doctors becausewe want to be different from the others. You are the person who inspires us to be doctors. My dream is that in a future I can have my own clinic and hospital. Be able to say, "" I did it"". I know that it is a hard dream to follow. But if you gives us the chance to be in your hospital for one day. My dream will finally come true.

I swear that my life will be better if you let us be in there. Maybe you had a dream too, and I suppose that it was not easy to became a professional doctor. Was it? So can you please make my dream true and give me the first steep to be a professional person. I know is kind of hard to ask you to let us be in your clinic because I know you are a busy person. But I just want to know a little bit about medicine. I know you are a great surgeon, that is the why I am asking you to teach me. I know that it is not easy to be the hospital's manager and surgeon but there if you can. I'll too.

DEAA54EC50F1,"Many students think that the school hours are so long. After a long time of school your brain and body needs a break. Now let's think about how long would it be if the school adds one hour and a half to school each day. I disagree with extending the school day because students will have very short time to play sports or participate in fun activities after school, will have more work, and have less time with their families and friends.

To begin playing sports help us stay mentally and physically healthy, but with tired body and brain activities might become so challenging for you. Additionally, injuries can occur. Also you will have homework, and you will have to do your favorite activity and homework together, and you need to be fast enough to do them in approximately three hours. For example, you play volleyball, and after the practices you went home. It was 6:30, then you toke a shower and ate dinner. It was already 8:40, you need to go to bed by 9:00, but you need to do your homework and project. If they add one and a half hours to school, we will not have enough time for our hobbies.

Next, students will have more work, and work means more homework. If they add more time to school, students will go to bed later because they will be trying to finish their homework. They will be trying to finish their work until late hours and they are going to have a bad mood because they will be so tired. Therefore, longer school hours will led students to have lower grades and maybe bad behaviors.

Lastly, they will have to spend less time with their families and that can even cause separation between families. Likewise, the student will have to finish his or her work, but everybody is at the dinner table, eating dinner, or they want to go to the cinema but they can not. The student might not prefer doing the work, but then he or she will have lower grades and the family relationship is going to be affected negatively anyway.

In conclusion, the school board should not extend the school day because students will not have time to play sports, will have more work, and have less time with their families. Adding an hour and a half will have a negative impact on students. They will have lower grades, bad moods, and bad family relations.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.5,8.0

68685615FE0C,"There is a debate about the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing. Some people believe that the best way to learn is going to the school independently if the student live close or far and participating with more students in the classes. Other people believe that no matter on what way you receive a class, you always have the opportunity to learn something new. I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn, because the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class.

First reason why I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student can pay more attention. Sometimes when you are in a classroom with more than 20 students is really hard focusing on what the teacher is talking about, because there are always some students who really like to make fun of the teacher, laugh with other students, interrupt the class with questions like ""can I use the restroom?"", and in someway you cannot even take notes; but when you are at home, all by yourself, without any distracction you can really be sure that you are paying atenttion and taking notes.

Second reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily. For example, lets say that you are in a classroom with a bunch of students, each of them have differents questions about the class, and the teacher said that he is going to answer each question by alphabetical order, unfortunately, your las name is ""Generic_Name"". In this case one of the best way to get that question answer as soon as possible, is having a conference class between you and the teacher.

Third and last reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. There are some cases where a student just have one class every day; what if this student live half an hour away from the school, it would be way more easy if this student can take all his classes in two days online, also, this can be a great oportunity to have a job while you are studying.

In conclusion, the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing is so great, beacuse the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. So, this opportunity offered by the schools to give this type of classes can motivate each student that live far to not excuse themselves to not finish a class, also, each school that do not have this classes should considered create them.

104DC38A503B,"I highly agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson. If you do not chase your dreams, keep a positive attitude, and attempt new things you will never grow. Growing what you have already mastered is a beautiful feeling. Not just to you,but also to your family members and friends. It is important to keep in mind you want to do the better for the good.

Chasing your dreams and goals is one of the most important thing to keep in mind. In my opinion, always chase your dreams, it may not be easy but completing the task will be worth it. Do not always depend on other individual thoughts because at the end of the day it is just you. Setting a goal you want to accomplish can lead you on doing bigger things. Doing bigger task will only make you better on what you have already mastered.

Also, attitude can vary on how far you are willing to go. It is fairly known that keeping a positive attitude can take you very far. While you are trying to complete a task, always try to keep your head up and keep the negativity away. Failing is not a option on growing. If you are willing to grow and have a positive attitude you will have more accomplishments. Your attitude will always depend on how you take things.

Another reason, is always try to attempt new things you have not tried yet. Trying new things would not effect you. It will only set you off on what is good for you and not. You could have the chance to master something else that is bigger than what you have already completed. I think everyone should have the thought to try something new then not growing.

Finally, these are my reasons why you should master more than what you have already done. Growing will only help you for a better future. Always try to keep a positive attitude and set your goals for more accomplishments. Do not let others bring you down because that is where your failing starts. Try to keep your peers happy, you will never know if someone is looking up to you.         ",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,7.0
357A3AE05BE8,"Emerson was a author which he has wrote many statements, but one of them is really interesting to read its about thing or achievement that someone is good at or have already mastered its mostly about a person's experience.

Emerson's message is that doing what you already know can make you grow even more no matter if you know that it wont help it will make you grow and be better.

Going beyond something it's learning something beyond what you already know that's why Emerson wrote a statement about growing by doing the same thing or experience without doing or trying something new.

Learning new or learning from the same experiences that someone already have been through to be better or grow just like Emerson thinks.

Being on the same situation or experience its not easy because face it twice can make you see things different or it can make someone see it better and learn from it, but it depends on how the person is or acts because not everyone thinks the same way.

Based on a agreement or disagreement there good reasons and bad reasons why EmersonStatment isn't 100% effective, Emerson's purpose or message is to tell many people that has been in the same situation or have been in the same experience that no matter what if that people are strong or if they know how to control their selves they can become better and grow because if that person doesn't face it then he will be stock and never grow.

For some people doing the same thing over and over is like wasting their time or they just dont care about it that much that's why not everyone have the same thoughts about Emerson's statement some people just don't care or some of them can't see what they can become, fix, or be by learning more things about their experience.

Mastering a experience or having control of it can help people solve things easier and help others with what others are being through is not always about wasting time or thinking that it wont help, becoming someone better is by learning fro the same experiences over and over again to see how things are.

People nowadays don't really care about what they being through they just ignore their experiences or situations, but not all of people just some people in general for example i have been in hard situations twice is not easy to face it two times but it makes you better it makes you change and learn things that you didn't knew before.

I'm one of those people that agree with Emerson statement because i have learned things and i have become better in some aspects.

Unfortunately not everyone thinks the same way like others think we all have different stories to tell, different experiences, and different lives etc...

Emerson's statement is like a motivation to keep going and be strong no matter in what experience or situation someone have been through the message has many meanings on how some people thinks about any type of experience.

Good reasons why this statement is good for most of the people that agree with Emerson's statement.

Some people think or feel that is nice to repeat the same experience because it makes them feel that they can get better at that situation and makes them feel what many things they can accomplish.

Just like it says on the statement it can't make you grow more if you don't go beyond anything someone is aware of, for some people going beyond means a lot because after what they have been through they become better and they see how some experiences work.

Some people takes situations better than others because they do know how things around them work, changing by small things makes some become different persons and they become more reasonable because of what they have been through without changing for someone just learning from their errors.

The disagreement for others is kind of bad because they don't know what they can become.

Some people thinks that going beyond their experiences is like wasting their time because they already have been through that and that's a big error in those kind of people.

Those people have no idea how good they can become by just gong beyond some experiences or some situations just because they think its too hard for them or for some people think that is way to much for them.

Others don't want to change they just want to be or they just like how they are without noticing what going beyond things got for them.

Some people thinks that is boring only because they know whats already is going to happen or just because they don't mind about how good persons they can become by just going through the same experiences or by just going beyond that, but some of these kin of people have learn and have seen what they can change by just going beyond or going more far than that.

Emerson's point of that statement was to show people how to change and how good is to go beyond the same experience.

There are many people that had change because of these statement because they have learn many things from going beyond and they see how better those people have become by going over the same situations.

my agreement was that doing things beyond anything can make you become a better person no matter in what situation anyone is.

Learning from mistakes is god because the next thing someone doesn't want to do is commit the same error over and over again.

Emerson's message is to go beyond things no matter what the situation is it makes anyone become a better person in any aspect.        ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,6.0
D7C9E22CC216,"Graduating Early is a Bad Idea

Personally I think graduating in three years instead of the traditional four years should not be allowed. School should really think about this idea before making it an actual thing, because for some students this could be a good thing, but for some students this could be really bad.

Graduating early to me is a bad idea because, I dont think it gives students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to learn while being in high school. In high school students go through situations, make mistakes and bad decisions, learn how to fix those things and not do them again. Students find what they really like to do in life while being in high school but some students need a lot of time to find out what is that thing that they love and want to do for the rest of their lives. Students that play sports need to play for a good amount of time to get better at it and maybe get an scholarship, students that take mechanic courses or photography courses need a good amount of time to learn about everything they need to dominate on whatever they do, so that way colleges can come to their school, watch them and find out if they deserve a scholarship or not. While being in high school, students learn how to adapt to new environments, new people and even different languages so that way when they go to college they are ready for anything. Students that do want to follow this plan and graduate a year early, are going to have to go to school during the summers or in the evinings, if students do that then they won't be able to get a job and work what being in hish school and they won't be able to learn to manage their money and to figure out what's good or bad for them economically.

I have a friend her name is Generic_Name, she graduated a year early because she took online classes and stayed after school to graduate a year early. Generic_Name goes to college and has trouble adapting to the new environment and dealing with defferent types of people, Generic_Name is having emotional pronlems because she is not sure anymore about what she wants to do in life. Generic_Name and I talk everyday and she tells me about everything she goes through, she tells me she can't get a boyfriend because she doesn't know how to maintain a healthy relationship, she tells me she's having economical problems because she's doesn't know how to manage her money because while being in high school she worried more about getting her credits than actually learning what she had to learn to be ready to the real world.

In conclusion I think is a bad idea for schools to allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years of high school. Give students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to be ready for the real world.             ",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,8.0

In science there are a lot of awesome experiments and tools you can use, and they are fun to use. If there wasn't any fun science experiments; I wouldn't like to go to science.

Some kids say that science is the worst subject in school and it is boring. In my opinion scinece has a lot of cool stuff that you can't do in any other fun activity in school. my most favorite experiment is when we are mixing chemicals because you don't have a major clue of what is going to happen when you mix them up, and that is what makes it interesting and fun at the sma time.

In conclusion there might be some better educational activities but in my opinion i like more science experiments, however, it does get boring sometimes and you just don't want to do anything, therefor, you just can't complain about life, you just got to with it and enjoy it .",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,7.0
09ED47E3BF27,"Some people believe that students should be required to take a music, a drama, or art class. I think students should take classes because they cannot being in a gang member, they can't be in depression, and they will have something to do after school. they will get a lot of help if teacher talk to them and convice them to take those classes. their brain will start working better and getting busy.

Firts, being in a gang is something really dangerous and at this time of the year all students wants to become a gang member. If students join on doing music, drama or art class they can forget about becoming a part of those gang that everybody is talking. sometimes students join these kinda of groups because they dont have the support of theirs parents or any family. But, if a student joins of doing music, drama or art class they can become a better person and a better student than being in a group where only bad people are. Also, students should think about themself because its going to be more fun and easy for them to join those classes.

Second, students that takes classes dont become a victim of depression. Almost all the students are in depression because they don't have something fun to do. some of them kill themself because they think that they are nothing and they don't deserve to be alive. Doing music students can take out what they feel and what they want to say but they dont say it. All the the artist become famous because they sing what they feel and people feel related with lyrics. This remind me of one girl who was in depression and she wrote everything that she felt when she was in depression, now she is a famous.

Third, students will have something to do after school if they are required to take a music, drama or art class. Sometimes students get to their home to use social media or play video games. Insted of using social media or playing videos games, they should be taking those classes where they can learn new things. Also, some students dont have homework after school so that should be a good idea or time for them to take classes. Sometimes theirs parents left to work and they stay alone in their houses, they should be doing music or doing art in school.

In conclution, i think students should be required to take music, drama or art class. They will not be thinking about doing something bad on themself or somebody else. This classes might help them to become a better person or maybe become a music, drama or art artist. Some people might say that students don't need those classes because thats waste of time or they don't need those classes to graduate. Also, they might say that students needs to think about their important classes and homework.",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,7.0
43B0E1211D58,"School is a very important part in a person's life, however it takes away most of student's and teacher's day. In a normal public middle school in Maryland, a student first class starts at 8:15 in the morning and the last class ends at 3:00 pm. Which means that a student spends 7 hours and 25 minutes in school, that is a long time for a person to be receiving information nonstop. The school board should not extend the school day, because that would take time away from activities that students need or will need in the future, such as: students would have less time to do homework or study, students would have less time to participate in after school activities like sports, and students wouldl have less time to volunteer in community events.

Students would have less time to do homework or study. Students already spends more than seven hours at school and usually has 6-8 classes that last 45 minutes each from those 6-8 classes at least

3 would have assigned homework to the students which means that the students would need time to complete their homework with accuracy, if the school days werre extended students would have less time to complete their homework which means that their grade might go decrease for missing assignments.

Students would have less time to participate in after school activities such as sports, or clubs.

Every healthy person should exercise for at least 1 hour per day and at school not every student takes physical education (P.E.) as a course which leads to the thought that students might not me be getting the necessary amount of exercise per day, and even if a student did take P.E. a normal class lasts 45 minutes, which is not enough for a healthy person. If the school board were to add one and a half hours to the school day students would have less time to practice in an after school team. Clubs are just like sports are a very big thing in a school, clubs shows students opportunities they usually would not get in a school day. if the school board were to extend the school day students that are parts of clubs would probably get less time to spend time in those clubs.

Students will have less time to volunteer in community events. Community service is usually a requirement in most curiculums, in past experiences I have had to have 75 hours of community service those hours were earned for volunteer work, like helping a teacher with younger students or helping a teacher organize her classroom before the school year, etc. . Those acts were usually done after school and usually took around 2 hours. If the school board were to extend the school day srudents would have less time to finish their community service and could eventually fail beacause of not enough volunteering hours.

Overall it is just more convienient for the school board to not add anymore hours to the school day so students can have more time for their other activities like sports clubs and community service",4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,8.0

Students would benefit from being able to attend a regular school because students will learn more if they go to a regular school and students can do more better or focus if they're in the regular class/school and they can ask for a help from their teacher or their classmate. The most important in a regular school is that you can ask your teacher face to face about your grade or your missing paper works on her/hes class. For example, Sarah is more likely to attend on a regular school more than an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because Sarah is more having fun to go to a regular school to see her teacher, classmate, and her friends everyday. This proves that Sarah is glad that she improve herself for everything especially for all her achievement in her life as a student.

This prove that involve yourself to any sports or clubs saw you will not regret yourself at the end.

EFF1803E4B81,"Why are people scared to fail? Is failing really a bad thing. NO! For example Churhcill says that ""success consists of going from failiure to faliure without loss of enthusiasm"". I agree with him. I believe that to have success in life you have to go through failiure. Failing with the same feelings and mindset is hard but you just have to think failing is a way of getting better. Failiure is also not something you should be afraid of or embarressed of. You should be proud of failing cuz you know what you did wrong and next time make it twice as strong. Failing does not mean that your to dumb to do whatever it is. It just means you need some more time. Churchill bleieves that failure has an important role in the pursuit of success. Which I also believe this becuase once you fall all you want to do is get right back up. Which I encourage everyone to do.

When you fall get back up everyone falls. Life is about taking risks and failing. Which in my opinion evryone should do. Failiure is the key to success. Without failing you can't really call it success. I beleive you can only succeed in something that you have failed at. Without failing life would be boring and everything would be the same because people are taking riks we have lots of different things in the world today. Everyone has failed to do something. Not everyone in the world is perfect. I wrote this to persuade my readers to take risks. It is also fine to fail just get up and try again. Surely, if Churchill was a live today her would be spreading the same message around the world. That without failiure there is no success. Also, that everyone has failed at something, nobodies perfect.

Churchill Is trying to say that faliure turns in to success. Once you fail you know what you have to do to get yourself back up. Then you try again and again until you get something you are happy with. This is what makes you try again. This is what makes you find and fix your problems. You get a lot out of failing thats why i think that anyone that is going through something tough don't give up so easily becuase its is ok to fail. Failing is a good thing not a bad. However, its hard for people to think in this way becuase they think once they fail its all over. Its not over until you want it to be over. Keep trying and Try your hardest.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,6.0
1A55C7B84E6B,"Is going from failure to failure the key to being successful without the loss of enthusiasm.

I believe that everyone should at least fail once or twice so that it will make them want to try harder the next time the try to do the same thing they failed at the first time they tried it so they can show that they care about something.

For example a lot of kids like to play video games so they get there parents to get it for them and when they first play it they dont know how to so they fail the first few times and thats all right because after a well they learn how to play it so the start to be successful at the game.

And it also go for a lot of teenagers and adults because when they start a new job they really dont know how to do it so they are failures until someone trains them what to do and then they start to get the hang of it and they become more successful with there jobs like when i first started my job i had no idea what to do and then the other workers at the place i work at trained me how to do the stuff there so the set me up to be successful at my job.

But everyone still fails at what they do and that is okay because everyone is not successful at what they do and that is okay because they have people to show them how to be successful at what they do.

Some examples of this: is the high school, college, the military, the government.

And the reason i picked those was because when the teachers in high school set the students up for success so they end up going to college and some students end up majoring in something the teachers taught them and others end up doing something in the government but then some of the students end up not going to college so some of them end up failing and not being able to get jobs and become criminals and some of the other students that don't end up in college either going to work a regular job or end up joining the military and making that into a career but before they do that they have to get trained on what to do so they won't mess up something and fail and everybody males mistakes it's just how they fix the mistake they made so they can turn it around and be successful in the career they choose.

So in conclusion everyone fails at what they do at least once in there life so failing more then once really is the key to success. ",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,6.0

Because they have to get required classes, then go to summer school, and get a good grad. and work very hard after school. When those student who want to graduate from high school in three years. they must work hard for their school. and they have to pass a lot of test and SOL. To graduate from high school. then they can go to college.

example;people who are's emigrant,and want to do the three years of high school;they have to work hard.

When student want to do the offer programs three year of high school. i believe they have to work hard. To pass their classes. Also getting good grad for their classes, i believe that they must study hard, and be properer for any test that is coming on. They must pass their classes by receiving good grad. Also to receive a good GPA for their record, Students must attend every day because if they do not do that, it will effect their grad. Then they get behind. from a lot of things.

example, student have to work hard in their classes to receive a better grad.

Student who is taking summer school, and work really hard to graduate from high school. I believe they will have a better future for their life, and their family.

Because student will have the capability in the future to find a good job that they wanted. Also those student will have the capability to go to good college to study will. I believe having a good back round from high school any college will accept those student; Also a good GPA, and those student who want to do three years of high school. Must attend every day to do not get behind from their classes, Because not being at school will effect their grad. Also student must work hard for their graduation.

example, student must go to summer school, and pass those classes that they need;also i believe summer school will very easy.

They offer programs of three years, I believe student must pass their SOL in three years of high school to graduate. student must focus on their school and classes for receiving a better grad. Also i believe there are some student who have to work full time. Also come to school full time, and they are in the three years of high school program. i believe it will be hard for those student who go to school and work after school. there will short time for those student, to study for their lesson from classes. Specially for those student who is emigrant and do not know any thing about they new school. But still they have to work so hard to complete three years of high school. to graduation.

example;student will the opportunity early graduation; if they work hard.

I believe that three years of high school going to be hard for student. But it is a good opportunity for those smart student to graduate early from high school. then they can start their college earlier. because it gave them capability to make up their life Earle. Also those student will learn a lot of lesson during high school, and after high school.

B794B3C07254,"It is my pleasure to take this great opportunity to express my view or opinion on the above topic; which is positive attitude is the key to success in life?.First and foremost i would like to briefly talk about the term attitude, it can be shorty defined as a good or bad conduct or manner ones shows in public or the kind of act you put up which is either good or bad. If we really take good look at how people live,attitude is the most relevant thing they mostly pay attention to, lets talk about work school.

WORK OR SCHOOL:

If we take good look at this two places, we can see or sort of attitudes aspects, either good or bad that is coming from the students,teachers and many more , showing good attitudes towards others shows how respect you are and what kind of family you came from, most people had a good relationship with others because of their good attitude they have acquire from school or at home,students with good attitude are more easily to associate themselves among others, and become very good friends , teachers really love students who always show a good attitude, sometimes too they can earn some gift from others.

HOME OR CHURCH:

This really take places in our various houses, showing good attitude to your parents or it can anyone ,mostly help to gain favors from people you might not even know they might be your futures helper, because there is a saying nobody knows tomorrow, for instance you went out and some random person ask if you can help him or her to find a place but your attitude did not let him even to ask you anymore ,but imagine some few years later came and you met such same person that ask for your assitance but your attitude was not good at all, maybe he is a manager at your dream job you have prayed to work there, so as soon as you get there you saw he is the one who is going to interview you do you think he will be willing to gave you such opportunity even though you qualified the answer is no he will find any means to let you not get that job , your bad attitude ruin up your whole life, this goes to church too,having positive attitude at church draws human being more closer to God and attract more blessings from him as well.

POSITIVE ATTITUDE AMONG INDIVIDUALS;

Last but not the least is the kind of attitude we gave among ourselves ,this has become a daily rampant that need to failure to get help from other people, imagine you had like 4 close friends but they are be asking for your help on something but some of them attitude is very pathetic , but insisted they really need your help and what you have on you can only help few of them, so would you go ahead and help those who had a negative attitude the answer may be no,because you going to help those of your friends whose had a good attitude first before you assist them too , this really tell us having positive attitude can really gave you so many opportunities or advantages.

THESE ARE SOME MERITS OF POSITIVE ATTITUDE:

1. It creates good interpersonal relationship among individual.

2. It easily to get favor from other people.

3. It always bring peace among others.

4. It really depict the kind of family you came from or the type of trained you have acquired.

THESE ARE SOME VITAL OR MAJOR REASON WHY WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE;

1. B

ecause it enable individuals to always have a good name in any places they found their selves in and, it also promote economic living,

because you individuals really knows good your attitude is so therefore they will always be proud to share their issues or problems with you without been hesitate.

2. It attract blessings from God , because the bible is even against anyone who does not show a positive attitude among his or her neighbor, and can make your life been successful with the help of blessings you getting from your creator.

HOW POSITIVE

ATTITUDE HELP US IN OUR OWN LIVES;

having positive attitude really help individuals a lot because this earth we live in everything is about attitude even assuming you apply for a job and they monitor you for awhile then later realized you had a bad attitude, do you think the person who is in charge of that work will be willing to hired you the answer is no, because no one can hired someone who has a negative attitude, so imagine now you had positive attitude everything is excellent you even feel proud of yourselves you do not even care wherever you might find yourself in because your attitude is really good and it can gave you so many chances in life that you think you not even to have it, you can also become a remodel to some people , they might even look at you and learn from you , so therefore is very good to have a positive attitude and move free wherever you go , some people really pay attention to people attitudes even more than everything in this word.

I've always had a dream of being in the NBA, ever since I laid my eyes on the sport I loved it. I know that with my skill level I could help out a lot.

I am inspired by a lot of players that walked foot on the court I am mostly inspired by klay thompson. Every time I watch him play all the time and I wonder how he became so good than. That's when I would go to the court to practice everyday. I work out everyday to become the next big thing. And if someone is working harder than me i have to work 10x harder than them i put my sweat, blood, tears to make sure i am better than someone who's better than me. Because if they are, it will be harder for me to become something i've always wanted to become.

The specific job it self is great I, would be getting paid just by playing a game of basketball. I would be in the spot light everyone will notice me and how well i am poforming. I would be famous because I would be a goat at playing basketball. And if that doesn't work out than that will just suck for me.

Everything about it is so wonderful, i would be playing a sport I love the most. Than getting paid to do what I love doing most. I don't think i've had a dream this big. I want the whole world to know that I am more than just human. This sport means everything to me and if i could have one wish it would be to play for the NBA. One chance to show to the coaches that i am a beast at playing basketball. And when that day comes I will have their mouths dropping. When I am the next big thing Everyone will be shouting my name at the top of their lungs. I have been saying this ever sense i was a little kid i will make it to the top. I will pursue my dream of working for the NBA.

I will take any risk that comes my way I am willing to do anything to prove what I can do. When that light shines on me I will finally have succeded my goal to being what I wanted to be. Becasue that's when I know that when i gave it my all, it came out to be a great thing.

The most thing I like about it is how good the money is. They make so much money just by playing one game of basketball. When I am there I will have so much money just by proving what I can do. What i also like is how well they work together but just how they play together the vibe they have with each other is honeslty great, when I come I know they would give me a shot. to succed in life. It is great to know that everyone can have a shot at something great if they have the mindset and heart for their goal.

If you could take the time to come see me play i know i will have you shocked. Because i've been working so hard for an oppertunity like this. After all, all I think about is how i can impacted people by just watching at how good my skills are. Just to show what i am capapole of.

For my 3 reasons why this dream is so important to me

The money seeing someone work really hard, so that way i can become just like them showing what i can do when the spot light hits me

That makes me work harder every day to become something I know I will be. I will risk it all to become this person that's inside of me that's ready to be released.

Generic_City has great places to visit. The first place I want to see is the sky buildings. The sky buildings touch the the clouds (that is the reason why people call them sky buildings). The second place is the wooden bridges. These wooden bridges can across forests. The final place is the gardens. The gardens have all of the plants on Earth. These are the greats place that Generic_City have.

Another reason why I want to visit Generic_City is that they have one of the best technologies. One of the best technology they have is robots. In my opinion, robots are difficult to make because it has a lot of bits and pieces to put together. Another best technology they have are air bots. Airbots deliver the food or items to your house. The final new technology is trains. The trains do not touch the ground. The hover over the ground. These are the new technologies the have.

C7A0AAFC607A,"Some people always like to be inactive and never do anything but i believe that if we always doing something we could accomplish more. Being active is better because we could be more efficient at our goals, we can be less lazy and we could get better at everything we do.

In today's society not a lot of people are efficient, but if we are more active we can be more efficient in every way. Imagine us have a job and if we would be more active we can do hat job easier and faster and get better at it as well. Being efficient is really important because if we werent efficient we could do bad in everyday life like our jobs, houses or maybe cleaning something. Being efficient means you have more accuracy on whatever you're doing for example to finish faster because you've mastered that job because of how active youve been lately.

If we can be more active that means we are also less lazy and more efficient around the house or job. Imagine being lazy it probably would not benefit you in any way at all since you would be slower at the job or doing anything around the house because you dont want to do it or youre probably wont even get up from bed for anything since laziness can cause that. If we could be a little more active it would make us less lazy and probably more profitable in the job. Being less lazy causes us a huge impact in our lives since it would help out in every way in our lives and probably grant us happiness.

In today's society if we are more active we can get better at everything we do since we would do it so more often. Getting better at everything we do is a good thing because everything would be easier in your life in every aspect of it not only easier but you would probably get more profitable if you're less lazy and more active since if you're active you'll get better at everything you do. Imagine you being inactive and hen being active it means more money and getting better at everything you do.

I believe that we have to be more active to be more efficient in what we do in everyday life since it would make us less lazy which is better for our jobs, schools and house and it will also grant us happiness in the future because you'll probably be more successful.

B6AFC844941B,"in my opinion i dont think is a good idea to extend the school days two more hours because students would be more tired. but in the other side it would be good because students would have more time to finish their work and they will learn more. and they will have a day off and they can go with their friend and do what they want. but if my school extend the school day two hour it would be good because that way i can do my missed work. and the teacher can help study for my quizzes and other work i needed.

students would think is bad idea because they will have to do more homework and the will not have enough to play or go out with their friends. but anyways it is good idea for some student that like to go to school and want to finish their work and have good grades. student would have a lot of time to do their work in class and finish other work they have gave them. for some student would be bored because they will have to sit for ten hours and do work but for other student it would be good because they like to come to school and learn. but others student just come to school and do nothing and dont pay attention in class and dont do what the teacher told them do to.

the disadvantages are that they would be so tired at the end of the day and all they would want to do is to go home and sleep. but the benefits are that they will only come to school for four days and not five days. and the teachers would help them with their work and they will learn a lot more because they are given two more hours of school. some of the student like the idea of coming to school for four days but some of the students dont like it. and some of the teacher also would like the idea of teaching only four days . because teachers get tired and they dont get enough sleep because they have to grade the students work and they dont have a lot of time to do it.

but other teacher maybe dont like the idea because maybe they have something else to do after school and if they extend school day two more hours they cant do what they have to do after because it would be late. but some teacher like to help student in what they ask them to help when they dont understand something. some of the teacher agree with this idea because that way they can teach more better and they teach student more so they can learn. teacher try they best for the student so they can pass their class easy and without any problems. if the student like to pay attention they will learn easy but if they dont pay attention they will not learn what the teacher is teaching.

some of the student like that idea because they want to learn a lot and be someone in the future. but some of the student are always complaining because they dont want two more hours of school because they get tired and hungry. but it good because they improve their skill and show that they can do it and that they will learn a lot more. but for the stuident that dont like to come to school they will not learn anything and they will regret it beacuse that whats is going to help them in the future. if you dont study evrything will be hard for you.

595308051AF7,"""Technology has taken over this world"" This quote is true because, in many ways technology has made it's way into our lives, and forced us to live in a different way. Technology has taken over this world in many ways weather it's online shopping, playing video games, or simply communicating with other people through electronic devices. Although some people think the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology is a positive effect, nevertheless, it is a negative effect because, people wouldn't know how to have an actual conversation with another person face to face, and people can get seriously addicted to technology.

To begin, people wouldn't know how to have a conversation with another person. For example if a person comes up to he or she to start a conversation face to face, he or she can't depend or his or her electronic device to do the talking for them. This shows that people rely on technology to much and need to know how to do certain things with out it, and if they're spending to much time with technology it may cause a serious addiction. Clearly, people depend on their electronic devices to much, that it actually prevents them from having a real one on one conversation.

Furthermore, People will always be depending on technology, and this can cause a serious addiction. For example, some people spend up to eight hours a day on any type of technology, this can cause a serious addiction and can prevent them from talking to people in person. This proves that, people spend to much time on their electronic devices and get addicted fairly quickly, and will begin to avoid human contact. Overall, people spend many hours each day on their electronic devices and has caused the limitation of human contact in a negative effect.

Finally, People wouldn't know how to have a conversation with a person face to face, and people can get seriously addicted to their electronic devices. In conclusion, human contact is limited in a negative effect because of the use of technology, and due to that people limit thier contact with other people.",4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,9.0
78B89BF70AE8,"I am agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because in this world you have to be yourself and if doesn't mater how you are, you have to be yourself even if the world is against, because the world doesn't change you. You change the world, and you have to be sure what you want and what you do not want, you have to be yourself, you can be different, the different it is not bad, because sometimes ""Be like others is do not be no one"".

For those reasons is why you have to be yourself, you have to follow your dreams and you have to fight for them, don't let the people throw you, and if you felt, you have to get up and keep fighting for your dreams. Remenber if you felt 99 times, you have to get up 100 times, and never let that people and the world convert you in something that you don't want it, in something that you don't love it, in something that you don't wish or something that you don't enjoy.

Also in my life some people tried to change myself, but I always try the way to carry on and keep fighting for my drams, and one of my dreams was traveled to this country, and some people told me that I can not do it, even some people told me that I will die on the long way from El Salvador to United States.

That was a long and a hard way, a diifficult trajectory, but I did my objective. It was not easy, because sometimes I had to sleep in the desert or in some mountains, so the polices can not found me.

Also sometimes I had to move the one place to another placer and some pelaple and me did it acrros the cars, but we had to hide on the trunk of the cars, and I remenber we was like 12 persons on a trunk car. It was not easy but I did it.

I remenber some days that I had to walk for hours to be in some place close the border, and also some days that i didn't eat nothing because I didn't have food, and in some ocassions I feel that I can't no more, but on my mind I had a objective and a dream. My objective and my dream were stay in this country and to provide help to my family.

But in my mind I am keeping have some objectives and dreams, and one of my objectives is makes to my parents proud of me and one of another objective for me is be a example to my brothers, I wanna give it to them the best of the world.

My brothers and my parents are the reason why I work hard everyday, and I try to do the best on school, I try to be a really good students but sometimes it is hard for me, because the languages are different, so I try everyday to learn English, so everything can be easier and that can help me a lot.

You always have to be yourself because a more than a person goes to like you, so just be you and don't let the world change you. Keep dreaming and get foccus on your objectives.

Don't be afraid in a world that is constantly trying to ,ake you something else, just be you and don't worry be happy, enjoy the little big things that the world give it to you like friends and family, enjoy with people that you love, and always be thankful with everyhing, if doesn't matter if it is good or bad, everything happen for a reason.",2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,5.0
7828C939A7F3,"In my opinion,I agree with statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because we need to sacrifice for things that we want,we need to fight for the success,and we need to be positive people, that yes we can do something.

We need to sacrifice for things that we want , because if we don't sacrifice for things that are really important,we can't gonna do something beneficiary. Like when I was a child, I know someone that was wont to be a doctor, and the problem was that for she can realize her dream, she was need to study in other city; but she don't wont to leave her grandmother along in the house, so she don't sacrifice for her dream, and she don't study anymore for stay in the house with her grandmother.

We need to fight for the success, because every body want to have the parents be proud of us. We can find the success only when we fight for what we want to get for us life. Generic_Name, was my biology teacher last year, and she talk to me and say that when she was in High School she was fighting to much with her problems, because she was have to much problems with her family because they was don't agree with her decision, because she wont to be a teacher; but her family not. Generic_Name realize her dream because now she is a biology teacher, and a very good teacher she explain really clear. so for she can realize her dreams was to hard because she was fight with all of her problems and her family that was not agree with her goal, she was working, and study really hard to be what she want.

We need to be positive people thinking that we can do something in this life, because when we are positive the things that we want gonna be realize for us life. I remember that one day my Mom say that always we need to have a positive idea because she say that she was wont to be go to college to help her family and give to her a better life;but her friends always give her a negative idea, they are saying that why she want go to college when she don't have money that she need to go there, the money that she need to can prepared. so my Mom was getting have a negative brain ideas from her friends. She was thinking that she can't realize her goal to prepare and be a big person with a good carriers to help her, and give them a better life. So that means that when the people have a positive brain, they can do whatever they what to do. to we can complete us goal.

In conclusion, we need to have a big character in us life, because if we have a big character we can pursuit, they can get the success in their life. We need to have a stronger attitude,and readiness to be a positive successful, and respectful person. A person that maybe was fight in the past really hard to be a good person with carriers and have good education;but for be a good person with carriers, we need to sacrificed and work really hard to have a good studies.

13450D581EC9,"I am agree with the Waldo Emerson's prompt. He wrote that "" to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.""

""Never give up."" This word conveys our intensify about our thought. It makes us courageous. Life is not a bed of rose, life is struggle. Every single person has their life struggle. Nobody is a perfect at they look. A perfect man is he who win the struggle. A successful man, he not get success in a second. He had lot of struggle in his life,but he don't stop for his goal. After long time keep trying made him successful. He adjust the struggle and keep go through the struggle and win the struggle which is make him success.

For example a soccer player has his goal to make a score so that they can win. But for making a goal he has to cross the against team then he will success to make a goal.

You failed !. You are done your life today. We couldn't expect from you this. You fool !. You looser. Now you go home and get sleep that's all you can do. Should I listen them and do what they want or give up my life? NO!.I am failed, i am looser but it dosen't mean that i can't win anymore. Don't lose hope. You have hand,you have brain,you have leg use those one day win come to you then you can show them that you did. you made it.

For example,you are not good in Math but it's dosen't mean that you are bad in Social Science. Show your talent. You can't able to solving the Math equation but you have talent to make Social Science rules.

Time is valuable more than everything. A good minded people use their proper time. If you use time and you failed in your success then don't lose hope,don't stop, don't blame on time and yourself. Time can give you more opportunity to use it and make yourself successful. You just have to keep try. But if you being lazy you just waste your time and you got looser reward from the time. Always remember that time never gonna come back.

For example, If you don't do your homework the teacher not gonna give you a grade. You gonna fail in this subject. You just waste your time. But if you do the homework but is incorrect. The teacher can give you one more time to fix the correction though its incorrect.

An Inspiration can make your goal. If you look or read about successful person how they became successful in their life you also can inspire to do what they did. An inspiration can bring you encourage. Make you sense what you want to do and what should you do for your future. There are different people has their different choices. From the successful people you can organize your life.

For example, there was a story about Robert Bruce and a Spider. One day Robert Bruce was laying in the cave and saw a spider was trying to climb the wall but its failed seven times to reach the wall of top. After seven times keep trying makes its successful. The spider reached the top of the wall. This event make Robert Bruce inspire himself.

Everything has their opposition. If you wanna be a good man you have to know what is bad things. The same way if you want to win you have to know what is lose. Fail is common afire in human being. If you don't fail it's mean you dosen't even try. Fail is a part of our life. But don't get depressed yourself by depression. You fail but you have more option to start it from the beginning again. Before you stop try just think should i try one more time. Maybe this time you can become a winner. Just one more think can bring your success.

For example, You digging a soil for the gold. You dig almost come to the gold but this time you give up and stop digging the soil. If he dig the soil one more time he can see the gold which one he want. So always think one more time before you quick.

An aim can make our decision properly. An aim less man can't success in his life. A right decision depend on your future. First make a routine for your work. If you want to success in your goal you have to follow your routine. In a student life its hard to follow the rules. But if you try you can do it. In student life student should give full attention to their lesson. homework should be done before going school or college. if you continuously follow the rules it will be easier for you to success your life.

Don't be lazy. Lazy is a weak point in our life. From the laziness your life never gonna successful. So always do hard work until you done in your work. some people we have in our society they has dream but they don't wanna work. If you don't work how can you full fill in their life. Always keep try to get your dream. We have time we have life just try as much as you can.

Some people in our society some times they messed up with your dream or your work. They don't wanna let you to do your work. This typ of people are very harmful to our life. They always bothering you can't lets you doing work. That time we should ignore them. Don't say anything with them. One day they will leave you automacilly.

For example, if any person can bother you every day and if you ignoring him one day he will not interest with you and leave you.

The success of life bring you happiness. You will feel proud yourself. If you show them that you did it then they will fell ashamed because they thought wrong think about you. So never be lazy. Always do hard work,keep try and think about it what should you do or not. End of the moment it will be

I think that some students in our country can benefit from able to attend classes from home, but I would do not agree because, the student can be more benefit to attend classes in school. For example, the students can practice deports that they like, the student can not feeling bored in classroom, and the students can take elective class, or academy. However, some students would do not like choose the offer distance learning as as an option for students to attend classes home by away of online or video conferencing. Just the student do not have other option to take credit for graduate.

First, the students can practice deports in the school because, the most students love practice deports and the school give then these opportunity . It is a passion to make what are you like. For example, when I feeling sad these the form how I can distract me, entertaining and I feeling good because, I can share with other people my passion for soccer. The practice deports can help most students to not consume drugs, or participate in gang. The young need a different world where they can have more opportunity to realize the dreams.

Second, the students can not feeling bored in classrooms. All students like to feeling motivate, happy, and entertaining. They do not like to be all day in one computer, or landlocked in home, so these the reason that the students like to going school because, they can share with their friends and know new people. For example, when I confused ,or need help with my homework I can ask my teacher, or my partner. we can travel to know the university, teather, and museo. We can learn about our history.

Finally, the students can choose elective classes, or academy. One of the reason that the students want to take elective class is because, they can to know what are their like. All schools in our country have elective classes, or academy about: kitchen, piano, cosmetology, art, fitnes, medical assistent, dentist, band, police, detective, electrician, and medical emergency . These class can teach us to find what are you want to study in your future. Only in school you have these great opportunity for know how you can to take a credit in a bank , or how you can they help for your university, how you can applicate for a beca and choose wich university do you want will going to study your career. For example, in my schools they help to know what a I want to study and they help to take a credit for my university .

In conclusion, some students do not like choose the offer distance learning as as an option for students to attend classes home by away of online or video conferencing because, the most students like practice deports in schools, the students can not feeling bored in classes, and the students have the opportunity to choose elective classes, or academy. However, some students do not have the opportunity to going a school because, they do not have family, others have to work and they do not have time or car to going a night school, and do not have other option for graduated that accept the offer to attend classes from home by away of online or video conferencing.

I think that the older students can help the younger students because the older students may have learned the things that the younger students have learned. Also the younger students can help the older students by helping them on there homework even if they didn't learn that. But they can still help the older students to solve the problem. After all I think there are so many ways to help each other out when being older or younger students during the program.

At the end of everything I think that when older students and younger students help each other out is first, The older students can help the younger students that need help during the program by helping them on a classwork or a homework. Because maybe the older student has learn the things that the older students had learn. Another way, That they both can help each other out is when the older student needs help on studying on a test that the older students is going to take.

D35A126B4379,"Anyone can have a talent or skill, you just need to see what it is. They can help along the way to get you something really helpful, for example collage. Your talent can be playing an instrument, singing, or dancing. A skill can be building things, sports, and cooking. The talent I have is playing a Guitar because it took time, practice, and studying.

When you want to do something big it can take a lot of time. Time is what we all need and time can go fast or slow, but thats good because it can really be helpful. Playing the Guitar took a while but it payed off, mostly because I used my free time to play. Sometimes I can get stress playing mainly by not having much time playing before a concert. It could be hard doing it ,but by doing so I can see my self getting better each day.

Practicing could get hard, but if your relax and not think too much you'll see it will be easy. Practicing can make you accomplish anything you've been doing a long time. Doing the Guitar was hard but not too hard because I've been practicing for a while. Playing some of the songs were fast and long, but when I got home I'd play the song over and over until I got it just right. Thats how I know by practicing is really helpful and made me be good at doing the I wanted to do the most in life.

Some people don't like to study and its not something we have to do, but something we need to do. I think studying is more of a thing you want to do if you care so much about what your doing. Studying the notes was one of the first things I had to do before playing the Guitar and the songs. By studying I can see the notes were not that easy to play and also tuning the Guitar, but thats why I studied to see what I was doing wrong. Studying is what I did to be fantastic at the Guitar also being amazing at the concerts.

In conclusion, If you want to be awesome at what your doing you need to use your time wisely, practice, and study. By doing all that you'll see that you will be amazed at what you did. Maybe you can even be famous for what you did by focusing on your goal. To sum this all up just do at what you do best in life maybe it can pay off real good.``",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,7.0

394F5867B7EC,"Working alone is great but have you ever thought about the benefits of working in groups? for example, when you are working with a group of people it it easier to get ideas; for example,you can all put your thoughts tougher and find out the resolution. Also working with a group makes it faster to finish the tasks; some people take longer than others so its good to have people around to help.

Most people believe that working alone is better but working in a group is more beneficial for example,if there is a problem that needs to be solved it is easier to solve it because there are more people to figure out the problem and to give their opinions; which will help throughout the way. In other words, if one of the group members has trouble with the assignment another group member could help them out;instead of figuring it out by themselves.

Working in groups could also make assignments become complete faster for example,some students while working alone take a long time and end up having to take their assignments home for homework; while in a group they can come up with a solution together and get it complete. It will also benefit the teacher because there won't be any late papers.

There are benefits of working in a group but there are also benefits of working by yourself for example,sometimes it gets loud in the group and it will be hard for them to focus and get their work done also some students like to mess around and play fight instead of getting there work done. Even tho working in groups could cause a lot of talking and play fighting , it is still a more beneficial way for students.

In conclusion, working alone is a better way for students to show what they know but working in groups is more helpful for students who are struggling. It has been listed on google that Researchers have proven that it is a more helpful way to learn.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,6.0
280BED11B625,"Most of he people are always triyng to be different in this world. It depends how is their bias and the society because we use to try to be better by working hard every sigle day. As Emerson said individuality is the greatest accomplishment, he has been in a world where people think being or living in individuality it's important for society because they must care of themselves. I agree with his statement about individuality, and I think it's really great being in a individual society because I can make my own decisions, no body can judge me, and trying to do my best.

We live in a world where poeple want us to be different or be better. Therefore, few peolpe are waitng something else from us, even if we can do our owns decisions. Hense,it's interesting how nowadays people are awlays judging others because someone is different or someone does not think as the way they do. However, I can make my own decisions to be different or better in this world because I can do whatever I want and it's my responsability to take care of my consecuencies. and persevere.

We already know since we were born that we have to be carefull in situationst when we are about to collapse. Therefore, we might be smart to make this world different, even if we are having problems to be succesfull. Also, because of the society we know we have to greater than others , but I

think if I want to be different in this world depends on me or my decisions because no body can't tell me nothing to be myself a better person. In another hand, I think my life depends on me, that means I am the only responsable in my decisions and try to make defference in this society, even if someone judges me.

My mother and my father always are trying to make my life easier because they want the best for me and they give me advices. However, living in my way makes me fell my parents were right, I have to fight for whatever I want, even if I do not what I am going to be in the future. Also, I have leaned it's always important to try my best to make my life better in acertain time to be a great person. Living in this kind of society makes me try always my best to change and be different in my own way or being individual to make my world or my life different than others to feel myself comfortable.

In conclusion trying to be different it's really hard, but we have to be smart and never give up to do not feel morosely. In my opinion being in a individual society could be great because I can make my own decision and no body can't tell me nothing. Also, this statement makes me think I am the only one who is the responsable of my actionc and try to be different in this world even if people judge me. However, trying to do my best in this society can be a great challenge to be a better person to feel myslef comfortable, even if others do not trust me..       ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,6.0

698A3F2B43B9,"Have you ever thought about staring your future career in a young age? Well, This question has been asked to a lot of people. Lot's of people have responded to this question saying ""yes"" and ""no"". Everyone has their reason why they start in a young age and why they don't start in a young age. In my opinion young student's should start to think about their future career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to be in their life and they will know what kind of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. Even though, some would argue that young student's shouldn't start to think about their future career in a young age because they will spend less time with friends and family.

My first example is, it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life in the future. For example, young age student's can change their mind and might not want to choice that path no more. Also, If that happens, young student's get's lots of time to think of another career path they want to take. For example, a kid is thinking about being a police but then later on he wants to be a doctor, that give the kid time to think about what he wants to be. Lastly, student's get a head start of what their future career is going to be like. In addition, This head start gives them time to plan and organize everything they need. For example, kid's have lots of things they want to be so they get a head start so they can get an idea of what career they choices to take.

My last example is, They will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to to get to their goal. For example, student's can choice the right classes that will help them achieve their goal. Also, they don't have to stress out about them taking the wrong classes. Like, If a kid want's to be a doctor when he grows up he will already choice the courses of being a doctor. Lastly, student's knows what types of material they will need for the classes; to help them get prepare. In addition, This helps the student's a lot because they will already have the mind set to think of what they will be needing in the future. Like, that's a good skill to have, knowing what you need in the future and not worry about it in the last minute.

Some would argue that student's shouldn't start to think about their career in a young age because they will spend less time with their friends and family. For example, kid's are so full of energy and want to go out and have some fun all the time. Also, they want to make precious time and memories with their friends and family. Sure , it's nice to go have some fun and get to enjoy life with the ones you care about more. However, you got to remember that you going to be the one responsible for your own future and if you put effort your going to have an amazing impact in the future with your career.

In conclusion, student's should start to think about their career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life and they will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. It will keep them focuse on their goals and will make a big impact in their lives since they already have everything planed out. In addition, this will prepare them for the real world.

Success has an role important in the life of many people since it is something that is necessary in their academic level, their jobs, and their goals to have a better future.

First, success is difficult to get at the academic level, but the students need know that although they are failing with effort they could get it.

6A4C8D0B9034,"It has been said that people are already born with impressions, and that they will never change that.. Honestly, impressions can hurt people; even the one we love the must, sometimes we don't notice it. I totally disagree that first impressions are olmost impossible to change.

First of all, impression is another word for saying that things that we like, or we dislike. For instance, when people see a nice car their first impression will like wow! now, what is really happenig is that people are admiring the nice car. Now, what if they see a old car from the 80s!? well, their impression would be different, and they will probably dislike the old car. But actually it is the same car, both of them have four wheels, both of them can take you to one plece to other place... So, honestly all that they see in the nice car, it is all a illusion! In fact, people tend to be more secure in a old car that was created for the safety of people. Because actually people in the 90s, or 80s they did care about people drive safety.

Second of all, a lot of people think that impressions are something that we cannot change. Well, in my experience I had avoided some impressions that were really damaging me, and people who was around me, too. For example, my dad one day he took me one of his meeting with his bestfriends, but when he took my there, he didn't tell where we were going; until we were on our way there. So, I asked ""dad where are we going?"" and he said "" we are going to one of the meeting with the young boy's."" when I heard that I laughed. Because that weren't young, they were so old. But my impression was like don't want to go there! I hate going to those meeting. Because whenever I go there, I never stay in the meeting, I rather stay in car. But that day I wanted go, and see why he liked it so much going to his friends house. When I got inside of the house they were super nice to me, they gave me food, we laughed. It was good. But what I really mean by all this is that impressions is something that we decide to change, or not. It is not something we as humen can change.

Some people say that your impressions are impossible to change, that an impression are needed. But If people can't change their impressions it will have consequances, wheter are good or bad. Another reason, people when they feel impress they don't think how other people are going to feel about it. When a member of your family gives you a gift, and it is a simple gift. But the person that gave you that gift, he/she gave it to you with so much love, and you just thank you. And the other member of your family you a brand new car your impression would like crazy. So, other person who has given you the simply gift he/she will feel bad because may be that person can affort a car. This is a fact, that expression could be change a in a different way.

Indeed, why some people care about if impressions are olmost impossible to change, or not? Why would I care? Well, because impressions is more than say words. impressions can show who you are. Also, your impressions can motivate other people. If we as humen have good impressions about other people personality the world nowaday would be less cruel. People would see each other as a nation, not as enemies.              ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,6.0

5902C2E86345,"Is influencing others other even a good? I believe that there are better ways to influence other than just by your own. One other better way is to look at other people and see how they have seceded in life. Another way is to see ones appearance and how they act. Others think differently and believe that your own behavior the the best to influence others.

My first reason why I believe there are better ways to influence other is one will look at other and want to be like them. This will want him or she to start and think on what they want for them selves. Maybe they do not know what they want to be yet when they grow up. So by seeing others and how they have seceded they are going to want to try new things. Looking at others by can also help the influence them by what not to do and learn form others mistakes. This could help them start on the right way. Thats why feel like looking at other can influence others.

My second reason is ones appearance cause when someone sees someone they judge off your appearance and how you act. The way someone else looks will want them to be like you if you are dressed with a suit and tie. That is because a person that is dressed sharp or elegant makes you look prfecinal Also seeing others the way they act can influence others to want to act like them. They might see how other act towards them and them probably want other to act the same with him or herself.

Others think differently and feel that your own behavior is the best way to influence one another. Some people might believe this because one person could impact one person so much that it will want that other person to do the same. I feel like that not the best way cause its hard for just one person to do so much. I feel like one person can not do as much as many other people can.

Therefore,this is why I feel like there are better ways to influence others than your own. Like notice others and see how good they are doing in live and might get inspired. Another is a way one looks to someone or they way they are as a person. Others might think the opposite and say that ones owns actions it the most impact full way on other people.

The University of Alexandria discovered that making decisions will define your stile of life; for example, if you will be successful or not. There are a lot of people who thinks meditation can help you to make better decisions. The best way to achieve your goals is making your own decisions, because experts and authorities can trick you, you will feel 100 times better when you achieve your goals, and will make you a leader.

First, experts and authorities do not work for free. They don't care about you, they want your money. If they really want it to help they will not ask for money. Imagine, you are in financial problems, and you think is a good idea that an expert will help you, but you still need to pay him, because he dont't care if you have financial problems, he just want to be payed.

My second reason is: you will feel 100 times better when you achieve your goal. The 90% of the people who achieved their goals with out help are more happy then the people have a expert and authorities. Their is something of doing your drams come true with out help that is going to change your life.

My third reason is what we all should become: making your own decisions will make you a leader. You will learn how to deal with problem because you made it till here with out help. Having experience and dont panic is what a making decisions will teach you. A leader is like a president a CEO of a company, people how can deal with problems and know what is the best decision for the moment.

It might be the same in some schools or it might be different it others schools. some kids may not like the idea of taking art classes and some may like the idea .

Kds may want to have space to take the class they want and they can't because they are required to take arts class . Like they want to take gym or something like this but i know that some boy's would not like this idea . If some kids do enjoy painting or acting . but some kids do not like acting or painting . They might think that it's boring for them to be in that class .

I know that some kids like to act cool and be rude to teachers that they don't like the class or something like this . That's why im saying that arts classes should not be required to take .

I think the best thing to do is to allow kids to pick their classes that they want to take as an elective class .

it's really the best thing to do in my thinking . Because look at it like this if kids that don't like drama and they don't let the teachers teach because they do not wanna be there . they want be in another class that they really want to be

. that's another thing that teachers have to go though dealing with rude kids .

8D0511CAA8B4,"Working with a group

In my opinion working with a group would be more beneficial for both teacher and student. Working in a group would help work get turned in to get graded witch will make the teachers job way easier. student can gain more knowledge in a subject. It can also benefit the students get to know one another and there insights on what they are working on in class.

Students would put there ideas together to help them complete the task. Each student can have different insights on a specific subject, It is more likely that students get there work done faster when they are working in a group and putting each others effort into one class work and or project that was given. In the case of allowing them to work in a group can make there grade go up or even go down, it is very important that a teacher knows who to put together in each group. Students that get along tend to goof off half of the time they are supposed to be completing the task given to them. Students should be paired up with students that don' talk to on the daily.

As a student high school my peers don't like to work alone, they often like to work together in groups since they feel they get things done faster and get there work done and turned in. In some cases, one student in the group does all the work and they just copy off of that one student, the others just didnt put any effort but just copy. That is the only worry I would have if I was a teacher. I would hate to give a student a grade they don't deserve. I would want every student in the group put in the same effort. Team work is better than anything to brainstorm different ideas from peers in the group.

If I was a teacher I would love my students to have group work more often, It will help my students work, talk to their classmates, interact with different students, and help their grades. I think that is a pretty good way to keep my students from taking a nap during class or even being on their electronic device. If a student didn't understand something while instruction working in a group their group members can clarify that for them, so in that case my students would understand fro a students point of view as well. My students would have a better understanding there would be higher grades. That is every teachers mission to make sure every student has a good grade in the class and is passing their classes, that can help them in the long run in the future.

Students should take advantage of the opportunity if they are given to work in groups because if they don't understand something they can ask someone in their group to explain it for them. Studies show that students often understand something when repeated by another student. In my opinion i feel like that is so true since i as a highschooler ask my peers to explain it in a simpler for and I end up remembering. I think that a lot of students can also benefit fro that big time. Some students can have more knowledge in a specific subject then the other student.

I feel like teachers should take this into consideration, students need more social time no more electronic time. they need an opportunity to speak to there classmates et to know the and ask questions. This would make students and teachers both happy. Teachers will have grades in earlier to grade and ready to be sent home with parents. More social activity in the classroom and more communication with the students and the teacher. I think that is the perfect classroom and environment i would like to be in as a teacher or a student. I would like to be i a place where i can talk to mt classmates and my teacher with no problem a whole big family. This can open many doors like classroom parties and a whole lot more.

There are multiple reasons why you should want to be yourself and not just a copy. First put in your mind that you are unique , by the time you grow up the reality will come to show you that you don't need to impress anyone but yourself and all your actions is for you, your mistakes will affect you the most .When you are copying someone you should analyze what you win from it and is it really worth it ?.Now , ask yourself if the friends you have are really your friends,just because they walk with you and they talk to you doesn't mean they are your friends , and worse if they tell you to change who you really are. A real friend is that person that would love you and care about your own good, a friend is the one that appreciates you will all your defects. Someone changing you is someone you surely don't want in you life. Believe it or not is better to be alone than with bad friends,inclusive your own family can talk bad about you ,they might critique everything you dress,eat,but that isn't reason to change yourself and be what they are expecting you to be. When you are going to be a grown up, how can you tell someone to be always themselves when you don't even got to known the value of it.

Being yourself is worth it, is loving who you are you won't be able to love someone else if you don't love yourself before. Having your own thoughts and always giving your honest opinions are good than just agree with something that you don't , being real is being you. Be real with your friends and if they don't like your opinions or they would make fun of you then feel happier that they finally showed their truth colors. If you cousins or any member of your family make fun of you because you unknown any argument they are talking about or they make fun of they way you dress then they aren't family. Popularity is nothing compared to be yourself, somehow in any time you will feel so stressed ,sad ,and down and that'll be because you can't fake no more. Get you own experience, have your own goals in life, create your future. Instead of worrying about being accepted just worry about what you are planing for the future. Be a right person at least, don't copy someone ignorant , be a good well , always appreciate the appraisal of what you parents thought you and don't you ever feel shameless for it. In the future the success will be good recompense .

Lastly be grateful to be unique in the world,be one in a million , always try to improve yourself and instead of going down go up , and if you think that copying someone that you think is up is being a winner you are completely wrong cause you are being a loser, know that there is a lot of mean people that could be around you and you might even call them friends when they aren't .When people is jealousy behalf themselves they can do anything to ruin you when you think they are helping. You want to be a winner then stand up and proudly be yourself.",2.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,5.0
405CEC6E7F5D,"Do you ever wonder if we should choose our own character by trait or let our characters be formed by influences beyond our control? I will argue that, we should choose our own characters by traits and not by influence. I think that we should choose our own traits, because we will be choosing our own fate or destiny, we shouldn't let other people decide our path and make a good character of yourself

Your character is your fate or destiny to choose on what ever path you should take. We all know that we should go to our own path to life and choosing what is best for our lives. You are the only one that can take control of your character and nobody should have the ability to take it from you. The fate or destiny is at the power of you hands and you are the only one to decide on what trait you will have on your character.

Don't let people decide on what path you should take and live with it. We should choose our own path to life and enjoy it. Many people know that we should be yourself and nobody else, we should be the character we choose to be. We all have our own character, we shouldn't influence people because you think that it is better for them. We shouldn't do that to other people because it was great for you, let them decide on what path they're going to take. We should only give them advice, but don't decide for them.

Make a good character of yourself, don't let anyone make you feel down. We are the ones to decide our own path of happiness. We can be many things if you believe that you can achieve it. If you think that this is a better way to a good character, then take it, endure it, make it worth it.

In conclusion, we should choose our own character traits. You might say, ""I think people's influences can be good for our character."" you are not wrong, but not all influence can be good for your character. It is what John Lubbock said,

""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""

It means that you are the one to take control of your own character. ",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,8.0

Do you need to work beyond what you have mastered to grow? Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Not everyone agrees that a person can grow after they have already done what they needed. However I agree because people grow by trying new things, people succeed by trying new things, and gain more experience.

Many people grow by trying new things. When people work beyond what they know they try new things. Trying new things can help them grow in many ways. People who try new things may know their job better and work harder. In addition people will get better at what they do. They will have more experience then others and know their surroundings.

Many people may succeed when they try new things. People will become more successful. They will know what has to be done and what does not because they have worked hard and know better. In addition they will know their way around. They will not need much help because they have done the work and grew to be better.

Finally people gain more experience. When people work beyond they will be more experienced. They will have more experience then others and help others when they need the help. People will be more educated in that topic and help others.

While many people think you can not grow. There are a lot of people who are probably growing because they went beyond to learn. Unless you do not do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

In conclusion people who go above and beyond grow because they have done more to help them grow and become better and to succeed. You should try and go beyond and see if you grown.             ",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,8.0
AB7823891008,"I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age.

My first response is some children can commit to a career at a young age, if they want to improve and they want a good future, they have to go to school and many of children can helped from their parents.

For example; if someone want a career at young age they have to work hard, and pay attention, some time is going to be difficult for them but they can do it.

Children engage in a career at a young age to prepare themselves for their future .

Also, is a good idea for students to a career at a young age because they are improve in a good age and they thinking about their future, but in a career at young age some children want to graduated at a young age, first they have to work hard at school, and there are many way, and programs to be graduated from Hig School for a career at a young age.

In conclusion, kids who take advantage of programs, and High Schools, are qualifying these students for their lives ahead in order to have a good future with a career they want. I definitely think that programs make a positive input in these helping young life.

E8795A1AA404,"When making life decisions it is good to ask someone for help then making the desicison yourself. Why is it better asking someone about the decision is because they could tell you either the desicison is good or they could tell you that don't do it and try to find a better idea. When making a life decision you have to think about the importance, how much it would cost me or whats the overall budget, and how its going to help me achieve in life.

When making life decisions it really matters on how its important to you or how its going to effect you in life. As life goes on do I think its going to help me improve what Im doing right now or is it going to drop me and destroy me for life. When making life decisions it also depends on how you're looking at that particular thing/object. Thats why you should ask someone else who is already doing that particular thing from before or ask someone who could give you an personal opinion/advice that would actually make you think if making this life decision is worth it or not.

When buying something big that will have a effect on my life i would have think about my budget and how am I going to afford this project without having any issues. So to do that I would ask someone for advice who is already doing that business or investment. When asking others for advice I would have to think about how they're going to respond and what they're going to say. This is why budget is also a very big thing when it comes to making life decisions is because I would have to pay that amount in order to have my business or investment stand out out the people around me.

Why would I have to ask someone to achieve my investment or business. To achieve my business i would have to ask someone for a advice who is already doing something similar to that. As Im asking for the opinion or the advice i would have to think how or what Im going to do to improve that decision. What hard work or thinking of mine or someone else's would have to go in that play to achieve the decision. As I would be achieving the decision I would have to see how Im being affected with it and how much pressure its putting on me. Why would I ask others for advice when I have brain and thats because they're going to have a different mind set from me. They probably think better than me or in some way where we both agree on the same fact to achieve the business or investment in a better way. This is why you should ask someone else for a advice or a opinion than going in alone in such a big decision that could impact your life in less than some days.

In conclusion to making life decisions it is a good idea to ask someone else for a advice than making the move alone. Its because someone else has a different mind set than you yourself. Thats why when making a life decision you should think about what things and what mind set you need to proceed with your investment or business. So the mains things you need is how important the investment or business is to me, How high or low my budget is, and what will I have to do to achieve this business/investment. For all these reasons you should always ask a person about their advice or opinion even though I might not listen to it but it doesn't hurt to ask. They'll give me the best advice or opinion even how big or little the investment/business is.",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,6.0

Family should be something big that influences you to make you who you are. For example the way you grow up with your family should make you feel influences and proud on how you are, Your mom and dad are influences they make you who you are and things you might like. Your brother or sister could be a big influences in your life my brother was a big influences in my life he taught me so many new things about car's that i didnt know of. My cousin's are big influences in my life my cousin influences me to box and i did i started to really like it and i tried it and stuck with it ever since.

Social media is a really big influences on everyone around the world. For example theres so many people out there that influences other people to work hard for something they like or might want to do. Social media could influences you to paint or sell things you don't need to make money or just try something new. Social media influences me to work harder to become a better boxing, i learned how to punch right how to throw a hook a jab even how to jump rope it also showed me all the things i would need to train or box like a speed bag or some hand wrap to protect my hands. Social media can make you try new things and learn new things and you can maybe find what you want to do in life like sports or paint or YouTube videos, there are so many things social media could do to influences you to try new things and stick with it.

Religion is something someone believes in, something there influences by. For example religion is something that is important to some people to help them feel better in life and keep them going like the bible, so many people are influences by the bible and what the bible has to say about life. Some people are influences by god and some aren't ,lot of people believe in god and feel like god can help them get through things when they are in trouble or if someone is dying in the family they believe god could help and save them. Other believe that religion or god is something that doesnt influences them, they believe that it isn't important to them, but to some people it is it's a big deal to them because it's important to them and it influences them to believe in something. Religion is a powerful influences so many people come together to believe in what they believe and there are so many religion out there that people are influences by.

Family should be something big that influences you to make you who you are. Social media is a really big influences on everyone around the world.

I agree with people who make their own decisions because it will build up confidence,higher chance of accomplishments, and it helps them understand from their mistakes.

My first reason why I agree with people who make thier own decisions in life is because, it will build up confidence. Having confidence is a big thing to many people because thay can do many thing in life and will not fail. Having confidence can help people in many places. For example,If you are going to a job interview you will have to have a high confidence in you ,In order to get the job. Making your own decisions will help you build up more confidence.

My second reason why I agree with people who make thier own decisions in life is because, you will have higher chance of accomplishments. If you make your own decisions you can have many accomplishments,because if you make good decisions in life you have more chance of success. You can accomplish anything you want if you make your own decisions,because making your own decisions can be anything you want and you dont have to follow anyone.

BABDE5D92BA6,"Life is hard and it is not a secret anymore, then if life is hard, how can I be successful in life. when life is going on nobody prepare others for the problems and responsibilities that come with the age. The years never stops, and there are always many people that look for the way to make problems eases, or just to have a life with out worries or trying to see the fun or good side of the bad things and problems. life is always giving good and bad things, but people find a way to be successful with out matter the problems that life give. Many people thrust that positive altitude is the key, that having this, non problem can be too big.

In my opinion, the idea that positive attitude is the key to success in life is completely true, I'm strongly agree with this for many reason, for example: having a positive attitude will be reflected in a good mood, people that enjoy a good mood are always smiling and more important are always open to ear other, have a nice relationships with all the people around them. positive attitude always help in our day, specific with mood because people are going to be stress less and when people are not stressing are always doing their best in everything. in life doing the best, is a way to be success.

In addition, one more reason of why I am agree with this idea is because,I always see in the people that has a positive attitude, the initiative for solve problems, it means that if live, work, or any kinda of problem come, positive attitude is a key to find the way and solve this problem as soon as possible and really good characteristic.

A person that have the quality to solve and find the easiest way to solve anything withing matter how hard it is, will always be a person that that probably always get better grades or a higher position in a job, it is begin successful in life.

Also, having a positive attitude will get a better acceptation from the society and family.

Is kind of interesting to see that being a positive person make in others the desire of being around this person. In this way accepted by the society and family, is almost impossible to not be successful in life, for many people, all the mistakes, or problems that they got in life, are always related with the relationship with family or society. That is the reason of why to be positive make better relationships, and get the goals in life. people accepted in the society and family do not have problems of self esteem and with out this problem you do not get scary to try need thins and be successful in life.

in conclusion, life is hard with out the, positive to success, all days is a different day to demonstrate, and find new ways to get the life goals, having a good positive mood will always help to have better days, with not stress, or healthy problems. when people got the idea of be positive and always try to thing that thing can always be worse, the world will be replete of success people. people finding the better and easy way to solve any kind of problem, getting value doing the best work at school or work, world will accept the society, and society accept the family, life will still be hard, but no a lot, because the positive attitude can make big changes, be positive is the real key to success.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,6.0

I chose stalyst professional because is interesting to do, you learn a lot about girls hairstyles and boys hairstyles I think is a really good job because a lot of people likes to do hairstyles and people likes to do haicuts because there is a lot of different things for example new hair color or a new hairstylt and stalyst is a really good job because you get a lot of money and you can do whatever you want with your own money but working hard.

Do you think that it would be a good idea for students to finish High School in three years?.

Many students, would benefit from finishing high school early. The program provides students to be in college one year early or in the force.

To have one year ahead other students is a big advantage to accomplish them goals. It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter to college or the force one year early, because students from another country that had to start over could catch up, and to have one year ahead in college is a big advantage.

First, it is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter to college one year early, because students from other countries that had to start over could catch up and graduate on time. For example, Generic_Name had just came to the U.S from Mexico, according to her age she is supposed to be a 10th grader, but since she does not speak English, they put her in 9th grade.

Generic_Name can enter on one o those programs to finish high school in three years so, she can catch up and does not have to do an extra year. The program to finish high school early also helps Generic_Name to be in college on time. To finish high school in three years is good idea, since it can help students from another countries that have to start over.

Furthermore, it is a good idea for students to finish high school early because to be one year ahead in college or the force is big advantage to many students. For example Generic_Name wants to enroll the force, for a year, and then enter to college to attend a college career. The program to finish high school early, would benefit Generic_Name to accomplish his goals, without using a lot of time. Finishing high school earlier, is a big advantage for students who have goals like doing two careers in college. Schools should provided this programs to students to finish high school earlier since it is a big advantage to be one year ahead.

Some people may argue that students should attend their 4 years of high school because students will learn more without that much pressure. This argument has a point since students would feel a lot of pressure taking so many classes and a lot of their time for school. However to finish school early can be helpful to students who does not wanna be in school for so long. For example Generic_Name does not like to come to school and all he wants is to finish. Generic_Name, have the option to attend the program and finish school early, so he wont be in school for long.

To summarize, the program provide students to conclude high school early in order to befit them. Students will be more successful, having one year ahead to enter to college or enroll the force. Giving the students from another countries the opportunity to attend this program will make it easier for them, who had to start over to catch up and graduate on time. Even thought some people may say that is not a good idea to finish high school in three years for the pressure they would have, to finish high school in three years is a big advantage for those who wanna go to college and for that people from another country who had to start over.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,8.0

My First reason is, students can have a future when they grow up. Also have time to think about their career and what they to want archive as an adult. Students need to think about their future career because, thats is what they gonna make for living, to take care of their self, and family. This is one reason why, I believe students should commit to a career at a young age.

My Second reason is that, students get prepared on the career the're choose; Students can learn more about the career. Also think about the things they have to have: a car, a collage degree, high school diploma. Some career's require certain requirements for the job. But at the early age, you can start to get parts of the requirements they ask for to apply.

My Third reason why, Student's should commit to a career at a young age, is for they can take advantage of the help they have at school. Some school's have academy at different schools for students. They can take free classes to help them and get experience of the career they have chosen. After completing the academy class, students will get a completion certificate, from the teacher. The certificate can help students, with applying to their future career by, showing the company that the student has some experience. Some jobs require certain requirements for the job like: having a collage degreee, a high school diploma, classes to take to get experance.

This is important because it is easier for students to build a friendship in the schools, some student do not have access to internet at home, and students will not be able to participate in a school's sports team.

It is easier for students to build a friendship, For example, my sister Generic_Name attended online school from first grade till HighSchool and she was always home on her computer doing homework and she did not get to meet and communicate with people and she always had a hard time trying to make new friends and make conversations with people, so my parents were always concerned about her and her mental health, so they decided to put her in a public school and at the end she was able to make new friends and spend time with them. Some people will say that ""Students could make friends through Social Media too"",but I believe that no one can build the trust with their friends through a phone screen, especially, student at their teenage years.

Some students do not have access to internet at home, For example, one of my friends Generic_Name did not have access to internet at home and she was home schooled so her parents had to give her ride to the public library and take her back home everyday, which they had a hard time with, and she could not really focus in the library, so she had to go back to her school after one year and she did way better than she did in her online class and she found new friends. Some people will say that "" students could go to their friend's house for them to do their online classes"", I believe that students will not have the time or a ride to go to their friends house, and their friends will not have time to let her come to their house everyday.

Students will not be able to participate in a school's sports team, For example, my cousin Generic_Name attended online class because they moved from her old school to a new school so she decided that she is going to take online class, but in the middle of the she got tired of the online classes so she decided to go back to her new school and she noticed that her new school has a really good soccer team so she decided to try out for it and so she tried out and she got in varsity and she got scholarship for college and she became a soccer player. Some people will say that ""Students could play soccer with their friends without attending a school"", I believe that students will not get the motivation that the get from a school's sports team, and they cant not get a scholarship.

In conclusion, it is important for students to attend a school so they can socialize with people and their friends, and when they grow up they can tell their kids about their HighSchool years and how they had fun and what they learned from their past, and it will defiantly affect their future by them socializing with people and being able to make conversation with their friends and their family, so I believe that students should attend school because school can help students with many things like: being friendly, being active, and it gets students away from their devices for at least 6-7 hours.",3.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,7.0

Although some say that success is not based on failing many times without giving up. Actually, success is based on failing and failing many times without giving up because some people that had failed many times in the past without giving up they became very successful in the future. Also, because failing many times gives experience to try more hard the next time to make better the thing that you had been failing you.

Those who believe that success is not based on failing many times without giving up have their reasons. They believe that success is began from the beginning doing the things better and better to make it perfect. Also they believe that success is based on doing the things in order to get better and better without falling to become the most successful person in life.

Weeks later he went again to try and he failed the test again. I saw that he was sad because he didn't pass the test. I told him that he don't have to be sad because he had one more chance. He already had fell two times he began to worried because if he don't pass the test the third time he had to pay classes to study the questions. My mom talk to him many times she told him that he don't have to give up the only thing that he had to do is to try to remember the questions that he get wrong and studied that questions and try do do it better the next time. That day my uncle got brave and he study the questions all day. Then, the other day he went to do the test again and he pass it with a perfect score he got all the answers right. He was really happy because the most hard thing for him was to pass the test part for the driving part he wasn't worried because he already know how to drive. After that when he got his license a friend of him told him that if he wants to work in his company driving trucks , my uncle told him that he wants to work in his company, but the problem was that he doesn't have the right license to drive the trucks. When he got home my mom told him that if he wants to work in that company he had to get the commercial driving license. He had to study another questions in order to pass the test. My uncle studied the question for a few days. Then, he went to the DMD to try to pass the questions but he din't pass the test the three times that he went. He Told me that he was very disappointing with himself. I told him that he had failing many times that test but that doesn't mean that he has to give up. Months later he pay for the classes and he went to the DMD again and he pass the test. Now he has his commercial driver license and he had his own company of driving trucks. I think that if my uncle wouldn't fell those test many time he probably will not understand that only because he fail many times he can't be a successful person.

Also, success is based on failing many times without giving up because failing many times gives experience to try more hard the next time to make better the thing that you had been failing you. I can be one example of that, when I came to the US and I went to the school for the first time all the classes that I had were very hard for me because I did not understand the language and what the teachers were saying when they were explaining the class. All the times that we had a test I studied hard trying to memorized some of the notes that the teacher game to study, but

I fell and fell all my tests and quizzes. It was so hard for me because I did not understand what the question was asking about it. But one day I sat down in my bed and I said to myself "" only because I had fail to many times doing my tests doesn't means that I had to lose my hope or give up. After that everything that i don't understand

I try to translated to my own language. When I began to to that I began to learn more and more and when I fell the test again I was getting more experience because I try to annotate what I did wrong and for the next time I was going to do it better. I think that if I had gave up when I fell to many times I probably will not be here writing these essay. Now that I had learned a lot of things I'm proud of myself and because the teachers had told me that I had been progress a lot. I believe that only because you fail many times doesn't mean that your gonna lose your hope and not be successful.

In conclusion, I believe that success is failing and failing many times without giving up because if you fail doesn't mean that you can't be successful in the future. Also because failing gave you experience to learn what you did wrong to do it better the next time. However, those who believe that success is not based on failing many times without giving up have their reasons. They believe that success is began from the beginning doing the things better and better to make it perfect. Also they believe that success is based on doing the things in order to get better and better to become the most successful person in life.            ",3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.0,3.0,6.0
709156BCF733,"Dear Principal:

I think students must have a least a B average to participate in sports. That way the students can bring their grades up. A lot of students would want to bring their grades up because they would like to participate in sports. That's a way students can bring up their grades. Maybe the students can bring their grade up and that way the students can work harder in class.

That way students can work hard and participate in a sport that they deserve for getting good grades. This policy may work so students can bring their grade up and stop failing their classes. One way they can bring up their up and be able to participate in sports is by turning in there homework and completing their work in class.

Here at SCHOOL_NAME we have a policy that says "" If you have more than three (F)'s you cant participate in a sport"". That's why a lot of students try to get a good grade, and that's why the students turn in all their work, in order to participate in a sport.

C454239AC43D,"I don't think our school needs to follow this model by extending school for an extra two hours. We need to be in school for seven days a week to learn and be productive in working on assignments, projects, tests or quizzes. We also be in school to be active in working and socializing with students and teachers. If we are in school for a seven day period, then students and teachers would involved in helping each other more and getting some work done that they were absent for or helping them work they have to turn in or they need help understanding the information they are given.

My first reason is that we should be in school for seven days instead of 4 days. If we are in school for seven days, then the students would be learning more about what certain topics the teacher is talking about. Another thing is that students can work hard on assignments that are due within two days or week. Also if they if are absent or just need help , then students can make up work by staying after school to catch on anything they have missed or just come in for extra help if they need it. One example would be if I were absent for like day or more, I could make up the the assignments that I missed by staying after school to make them up. Or having to just coming in to get extra help on assignments that I don't get or having trouble on.

My second reason would be that teachers will be there for seven days to help you with anything. If you don't get what assignment is asking or understand it, then a teacher can help you by reading it to you or explain it to you. Teachers will be there everyday to help you with anything that will help you succeed in their class. Also they will be there to help motivate you in getting good grades in any of your classes and passing them. My second example would be If I didn't understand the information or just give up on the assignment, a teacher would be by my side. they would motivate me to never give up and always try to do your very best on any assignment that was difficult for me.

My third reason would be students would be engaging with other classmates. Students and classmates don't have to only engaged in helping each other with assignments. During a seven day week, students can talk with their classmates or friends during lunch or if the teacher allows you to talk. Also your classmates or friends would love to ask you if want to participated in after school activities or clubs. My third example would be If my classmates or my friends ask if you want stay after, I would say yes. Then I would get involved with my with my classmates or friends and start talking with them.

Some people think that having a four day school week would be better for them. They think if they have school for four days only, they would have nothing worry about. Like for example, they wouldn't worry about much work needs to be done or how the work will affect how they are. Also what grade you will get on a assignment or when to turn in your assignments.

Some people think that having a four day school week for be bad for them. Students would be worrying about what they got on a assignment or test. Others would be panicking when to turn in assignments or when you can make up a test or quiz. Like for example, If students only had four school days to turn in assigments or make up a test or quiz, then it make the students feel bad for themselves or they can feel sad and sorry for themselves. Also they wouldn't know how they did on a assignment,test,quiz and what grade they got on it.

In conclusion, Students and teachers would much rather a seven day school week then a for four day school week. Then students can work hard on their work, while the teacher will be there to help with help or any questions that you have. Also if the students are having any trouble besides work, then the teacher will be by your side to help you or motivate you to make you feel proud of youself.",4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,8.0
E8485EFFC9A2,"The outdoor activities parks, get people to know each other better. The activities outside is fun, because you get to meet new people, where there is always competition and competitors. The main thing what makes an activity fun, is the enthusiasm of the people, having an enjoyable moment. However, how people or siblings cheered for you and others for the other team, is sensational. In Conclusion that's what makes a game great, the fact that has many memorable moments, that you will never forget.

In general, activities exercises your body, ounce you get use to running ,or playing sports. Techniqually, you wanna do more when you really like the activity that your doing, thats enthusiam for a motivation. Then, you definitely wanna be the best at it and there is others, that have the same interests like you. So, there's people that are gonna get across your way, because their unstoppable like you. Since, a child they liked activities that motivated and inspired them, to be good at, eventually this two big starts find each other and there both nemesis. So, lets say your motivation was only getting a scholarship, by sports, and the goal, that you propose to yourself, eventually you completed it. Supponsendly after 30 years your in national TV playing the finals cup worldwide, for your team, thats were imagination can take you from a winner to a star.

It starts from just playing with friends, finding encouragement from siblings. Then just practicing and from there is your decision were you wanna take yourself. Along the way, you can become a successful professional player, like Messi,Lebron James,Usain bolt,etc. However, thats the main point goal for others, but nesecerally you dont have to be good or the best at a sport. Certainly, if you participate on activities is good, because your showing potential as your age grows. Also your forming you body in general, which makes you stay fit, fresh, and always hydrated which is good for your health.

Everybody starts from going from different clubs and parks, where you could start going from your community. Then the state and then national parks, provide you greater opportunities and that's were the journey begins. I like to think that activities generally sports develop your body in a sort of way, that it can also develop your brain into knowing more knowledge of that sport and knowing every detail of it. Neseceraily, not only physical effects can happen to your typical common general body muscles, but having an understanding of the game can be outstanding which requires critical thinking that can affect your organ brain in a good way . If you get to see chess not considered really a sport ,but an activity that exercises your mental thinking, others find this game or other games interesting too and really find the complexity of the game and thats how legends form in any type of game.

The community and people are starting to know each other better by Community activities along everywhere State communities, and National communities. If you asked people that do activities everyday, they will say almost everyone in the world, ounce upon a while everyone did a activity. Since, is what forms your body's growth, shape,and knowledge. The main thing is that there is activities for everyone, that everyone can be good at something and they can have a good time, on what they're doing.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,4.0,3.0,7.0
CB4C85EFAE67,"The author Waldo Emerson wrote a statement or quote that it say ,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" basing on my point of view or experiences, I agree with him, I think the same, we will never grow if we keep doing the samething that we already mastered.

I'm taking this position on this issue becasue I have my reasos to sopport my position and to explain why this author is right.

First reason is on point of view if you're already mastered in something and you're keep doing it , to be better or go beyond then my opinion is that you're wasting your time on something unnesesary because you're already mastered , just be happy with what you have and knows a sample are the

Childrens they always wanna something if they have it they want more and more or when they are playing they wanna play possiblely the all day when they realize the day is already gone but they don't care because they think that they have enough time to play so it is the same with us. sometimes we wanna be betters than another people or just feel good but we're wasting our time in somethin that we already mastered.

Secondly the author Emerson show us the true in a quote we can stop doing something that we already mastered we could try to do something else or try to learn something new that can help us in the future of that way we can start growing because we start to learn about differents things so we have more knowledge and we can survive and we can realize or knows how the life looks like. A sample to be a boss you need to know or have more knowledge at least than yours employs or to be amanager you have to know many things.

Finally unless you try to do it better or be better than the rest of the people always is gonna be someone else who is better than you then that time you're wasting doing something beyond than you knows ,use it to teach someone else or learn about some else how to be better in something , teaching someone else or learning from someone else you can start to grow. A example is a old brother he learn about his parents and also teach and care his youngest brother of the way he is starting to growing up because his taking a responsability .The example can show us that we need to about experiences or advices or people who has more knowledge of that way .

In conclusion for these reason and supporting with examples that I wrote, I agree and think the same with The author Waldo Emerson , I took this position because If we try to do something beyond what we already mastered, we will never grow. Also we wasting our time and we could use that time to learn from someone something else what we do not know or teach to someone else about our knowledge . what we can help us to grow or be better in the future concluding I agree with Emerson's statement.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,6.0
C8EF7048C03F,"When you're looking for advice, you might not go to the same exact person. Hopefully you do talk to more than one person to make a better choice and give up the less opportunity cost. Most people talk to more than one person to see their other options instead of putting all one decision into one person's own opinion.

One thing I like about talking to multiple people for advice is that they can give you so many open options to pick and decide from. Most likely if all the people you talk to about advice or help, you will pick what they have choose. Which can be good or it could lead to a bad cause. Your always gonna have a opportunity cost. You either make a good or a bad move, which can lead in different directions. including the rest of your life, your mood for the rest of the day, the improvement, or the impact. There are multiple options that can occur.

Another reason this option is good is because you can hear all the others people's opinion's about your choice and you can mark out the ones you have already happened to you in a perfect or an awful way. You can also, pick their opinions or options and learn from it either if it's gonna be a bad time or a good time. After you have learned you can help out the one's in your same position or a little more different. But still can be able to help others in need. You can learn from it and help other's or you can learn from it and help yourself in the future if you ever come upon the same situation. Or even teach the one's need in teaching

One dislike I don't like about talking to a couple of people for advice, is hearing their opinions and advice it could possibly change your mind of you were thinking about before, But also it could be the better choice of the 2 or more open options. Different people can give you different responses about your situation. Which can make your problem worse of the option your gonna have decide to pick which advice could outrun the rest. Even picking which choice your gonna make can put more stress and pressure on you. Maybe even after picking your choice it could turn out the worst day of your life or the best. It's really hard to make the selection of which advice your gonna pick.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,6.0
C7AC45EF9D03,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I absolutely agree with that statement, because in my opinion I see success as a goal that everyone on this earth should somehow reach to. However, it's not that easy and not everyone is able to to that.

For example, my father is a successful business man by helping others and our family, he has done a lot for me. He also took risks and failed multiple times in order for him to be successful in life. Not just because he has a lot of money, because otherwise not every rich individual is successful. You must fail in order to better yourself and learn from your mistakes, because that will benefit you in the long run.

For me, I want to be a successful business man, just like my dad. I also want to travel around the world, and gain knowledge. but my goal for know is to pass all my classes with a high GPA, to show my parents and myself that I can do it. Yes, I failed one of my classes before but I didn't give up. As Winston said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I'm going to keep working hard in order to graduate and chase my dreams, just like my father did.

In the conclusion, I think that Winston said a true statement. I personally agree with him, because in order to be successful in life you will either need to learn from your personal mistakes or others. That's honestly what I am doing right now, since I'm still a teenager. Learning from others help you develop new skills and knowledge, especially from the old generation.

92F7DD653EFB,"Some people think that is more beneficial working alone that working in group. Which I disagree with for two reasons: People always need help and is more beneficial working in group. I feel that the benefits come from others.

The first reason is that we as a human being, we need help. When we are working, we need help from others at work, during class at school, anywhere where we work. For example, at work when I'm cooking I also need someone that can brings the ingredients. Some would argue that, working in group don't help you to learn, but we learn from others not from ourselves. As a result, we obtain help from others working as a group. Additionally, we obtain benefits working in groups. In addition, benefits to us are made it from others, benefits to others are made it from us. To illustrate, when I'm sick, and I can't go to work I need someone to change his scheduled, and take my place, for that day, so he is going to need the same benefit from me to cover him one day he get be sick, or will have any emergency. Some may say that working in group is not beneficial, working in a group we acquired more benefits than working alone. As a result working in groups give us the chance to have more benefits.

It's obvious that, working is groups is more beneficial this will allow us to get the help need it from others, and to have more benefits made it by others. We should always work in groups, helping each other as a human being.",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,6.0
D92BFF2AC7FD,"Do you think is a good idea to change the school lunch menu for something healthier? In this essays, I will argue how a healthier lunch menu can improve students diet and make them more secure of themselves. People that eats healthier tend to be more active and optimistic like my family.

My mom has been a great example to my family. ever since, sher started eating healthier we have seen a big change in ther. she gets on time to her job and has more time for me.

Although, my family eats healthier, not everybody keeps their diet. My uncle was the second one that started eating healthier but, it has not shown any results out of his diet because, he eats junk food before he gets home. this behavior has make his more fat and lazy.

Moreover, when my family started eating healthy, we stopted expending in junk food. Eating healthy helped us reduce our expenses by a lot. All the money that we used to spend on junk food has been going to an index fund, that will be used once we finish highschool. It wiil be used to start a company.

Some people think that eating healthier doesn't get you anything but, they are wrong because, healthy food gives more nutrient than junk food. In the world, healthy people have been very successful.

C373FE627501,"Society is a big part of our lives now in days. We all feel like we have the need to look or dress a certain way because if you don't your not ""fitting in"". Trying to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something your really not is a great accomplishment that i've dealt with before. Its something everybody has to deal with everyday, but we all never really think about it because we all do it and at this point it just seems so normal. Society can be bad but also very good if you know how to maneuver it. Society really sets goals for your mind and truly can help you with great accomplishments that maybe you would've never thought of if it didnt exist.

I take position in this issue and i'm sure many other people do too. In this world it is really hard for some people to be themselves and not feel insecure or judged because of society. Being yourself shouldn't mean you have to meet every ones expectations to what the ""real world"" wants you to seem like. We all have freedom of speech and freedom to do what we would like.

You really just have to appreciate everything life has to offer instead of complain. At the end of the day being yourself is the only true self you ever will be. Theres truly nothing better than that. Constantly trying to please people on how you should act or talk etc; will take you nowhere in life and if anything you will just be upset about yourself all the time. Although without society we wouldn't really have any goals in life.

High school can really teach you somethings about being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else. Students try to fit in to groups that sometimes they really don't belong in. Then end up get them selves in trouble because of the people they chose to hangout with. This all just ties around to just being yourself and loving who you are and every single insecurity you might have.",4.0,3.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,8.0
0316F6288791,"The new generation of students decide to take their classes in online. Although if the students take classes in online they might allow to finish high school in a short time,also they might be safe at home, they can take more free time to work or enjoy with their family, and graduate as soon as possible and start the college.

Even thought some people might say students shouldn't take classes in online because they can not learn good enough, they might be distracted or even ask any question to solve their problem, regular high school have different program to help students to be successful on their grades. In this case students need to talk with any consular or teacher in school to give some advantage and disadvantage about online class, student might need to know their benefits on what they going to do for their own good. Most people care about education, students need put some interest.

concluding with this state argument student should take any classes in online because they don't put much interest to learn any assignment, students might need to attendance to a regular high school to learn and have better apprenticeship, and abilities for their accomplishment, students in high school are more successful, they have good opportunities to get in the best colleges. Nowadays teenagers are more focus in having fun, some of them do not know that education is very important, if we want to have a good job and better future, every child need education first, but students are following good rulers.

according to this argument I have this experience my brother want to take his classes in online because he does not want to come to the school, i still in a normal high school almost at the end of the first quarter and my brother still waiting a call for his classes. He said it was his best choice but in my opinion that was not a good idea because if come to the school i learn and understand my classes, when a teacher is explaining and helping me to do my problem i feel more exciting about it. I want to be a great student and learn everything instead of be at home waiting for an acceptation for classes.

concluding with my argument students would not benefit to attend classes in online, attending to the school is more important and benefit, they take serious their resposabilities in everything,they became more measure,classes in online never going to be same as the regular school, students never are going to learn very well, teeneger really need to attendance the school for a better education.

High Schools Program shoud be a way to help the future profesional to find what they are really want to be in the future, high school stage is one of the most important step for the young age students, Because there is when they choose their future, We need to work with them the best way is posible, We need to find out a programs that impulse them to continue students after high schools graduate.

In some case parents try to tell their children what career they have to take, In that case if the students have to choose a career by the time they are entering to the high schools, Most probably will be their parents choosed what career they are going to take it, So that may be a mistake for the student because when they finally found themself, Probably they realize there were something else more interesting for them that they could take it, At that time would be too late.

Also some students may take a career that doesn't make the money they were expecting, or choosing a career that's not fit for them,

What the high school should be concern about is to form the best profesional for the future, Teaching them the best educations is posible and the same way showing them what kinds of career are there,The advantage and the disadvantage all the career have it.

High schools programs should know they're playing a really impotant roll in the future of the country, However the programs needs to be concentrated, should be educated the young guys the best way is posible,

Create a programs to keep them away from problems like; Grugs, Alcohols, Gangs. This 3 problems are killing our new genetion, This is one of the reason why the students leave the schools at early time. Also the high schools needs to help the students to find the career that will make them be happy in the furute. Should not be the high schools expected to the students to identify a career before or at the time their are entering to the high schools.

In conclusion, high schools students, In my opinion are not ready to choose a career yet, At their age they may not know what really want, or be ready to make such a big decision.",2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,5.0

Singing makes me happy because whenever I'm done singing a song it makes me smile. Once I'm done singing a song I'll have the urge to sing more because I love to sing. Ever since I was a little girl I would occasionally ask my dad to sing to me and ever since then I've always been passionate about singing. I sing whenever I'm sad and then I choose a song and I'll sing to the song I chose and it'll make me happy.

Me and my best friend play around a lot and when we do we'll start singing but in a fun way. We'll be so off key. And start goofing around. We'll do singing contests. This one time we did a singing contest that went on for hours and it turned out to be a tie. So we did a rematch and she won that rematch. So we had another one then I won.

Singing has been helping me relieve my stress a lot lately. Because since SOL's are like right around the corner I've been singing to just get my mind off everything that's stressful. I felt relieved to sing because I hadn't sung in quite a while. I also felt very happy to sing, after singing I was energetic.

Most of the time we tend to think that because we're adults we are doing the right thing, but instead we're doing the opposite. Once you start to see the downfall,or the bad things that have started to happen to you or the people close to you because of the decisions that you made, its time for you to go for to seek for guidance. Its best that you seek help before you're life falls apart.

Guidance has helped a lot of people with their daily lives. The best part about it is that their's no age limit for when you can and can not go. For example high school students have the privilege to go for guidance at school anytime they need it. One important thing that high school students are given during guidance is to always pick the classes that will help them in the future. Going for guidance should begin at an early age. When you start going, you get to understand the aspect of life and the decisions that you make as you move on with you're life. Its a great place to go when you have no idea of what you're going to do with you life or how to make the right decisions.

The best part about going for guidance is that you are assured you'll be talking to an expert;meaning that they are able to control themselves in any situation and talk to you in any circumstance. Most of the people who hold these jobs have degrees and are licensed to do that work. For most people,talking to someone the do not know is easier that talking to someone who they know. In this case it's easier to open up to an expert who will soon give you advice and what to do next with you're life.

After all maybe guidance isn't a good place to go. One of the reasons that people don't seek for guidance is that it's too expensive. Most people can not afford to go for guidance every month or week. You need to have some form of income or at least be making a decent amount of money in order for you to afford it. The second reason would be, you're not really sure that the decisions that the experts make for you will be helpful. Its not always good to rely on what people say or when people tell you what to do with your life. In the end we are the ones who know ourselves better than anyone else does.

In conclusion most of us still need help with the decisions that we make. We all make good decisions and bad choices. As we grow we deal with so many things and sometimes its good to always talk with an expert. After all we're not perfect but the best decision for you is to seek guidance.

A9A92BCA4B7D,"Failures are Part of The Success

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". The failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success. A successful dreamer's life always have a lot of failures, but without loss the enthusiasm. Be perseverance do not let a person loss the enthusiasm still having failures. To accomplish a goal a person will have failure to failure without loss the enthusiasm.

Firstly, failures have an important role in the pursuit of success. Is something impossible be successful without failures. Therefore, every single human have a dream and everybody want to accomplish their own dream, but it cannot be accomplish without mistakes as a failures. For example, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an important leader from the movement of Civil Rights. He fail his own opinion and rights in from of people who were more powerful than Dr. Martin, but with those failures he was a successful leader of Civil Rights. In others words, in King's life failures played an important role in his pursuit of his own success.

Secondly, every successful life will have failures, but the point is do not loss the enthusiasm. Have the power to still having enthusiasm when everything is fail make a person pursuit of success. In others hands, a successful life is constructs by a lot of failures, but without loss the enthusiasm that let you still pursuing. For example, Gabriela Douglas was the first gymnast with a gold medal in the United States. In her professional life, she had a lot of failures. One time she broke her right leg when she had her first presentation in the best school of gymnasts in Japan with the best trainers, but Douglas was helping herself and she was taking therapy sections to be ready for the next presentation where she was accepted. In others words, the key to be successful with failures is do not loss the enthusiasm.

Thirdly, be perseverance do not let the people loss the enthusiasm with failures. Have a perseverance character make the the people strong in front of failures. Many people said that be success does not consists of going from failure to failures without loss of enthusiasm. In others words, when a person want to be success and in that road have a lot of failures it force this person to loss the enthusiasm as a result of those failures. However, a lot of people believe that is a kind of impossibility have enthusiasm when you have some failures. To retake Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

In conclusion, Churchill's quote was humbling and impacting. The failure play an important role in the pursuit of success. Is not impossible still having enthusiasm when a lot of things are as a failure. Be perseverance is the key to be success and do not loss the enthusiasm. Success consists of going from failure to failure and do not loss the enthusiasm.",3.5,4.5,3.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,7.0
085C8B43ADD6,"Some students would be more excited about having a longer summer vacation, it can give the students a longer time to spend with their families and friends, but if we think in a positive side it also means that having a longer break i could be most likely be a reward for those who has been studying hard throughout the whole entire year that deserves to get a vacation or a break of getting away from everything that has them stressing out over paper or either having to worry about their grades, which is good for students to knows how serious and important their education is so, they can success in the future all full of opportunities knowing what do to when it comes to face their problems alone base on what they have learn.

For example in this Prompt educators thinks that students do not seem to retain what they have learn during the year when they are coming back to school after their break, they seem not know about anything or forget about stuff, which is true people to not appear to be thinking about things that might stress them out, instead they try to have fun with their love ones, and of course try to read some books every other day or read the news papers so you wont be left behind on what is actually going on in the world, perhaps we might forgot about stuff younger people are faster learners and thinkers, can not be able to forget about important information that easy.

Most of the students usually travels a lot during summer vacation out of the state or they like to visit different countries, so yes basically what i'm trying to say is that a longer break or summer vacation is a good idea for those in specific who travels far away so it can give them enough time to explore wherever they going to be staying, and this can even be helpful for students to learn about different history, experiences, explore and this are some stuff that they can even share with their friends in school or with their teachers, that it can improve more their knowledge. Being away from school just for at least one month it can really effect anyone, I think that this could be effecting on just depending on how distracted you will be during the break, some students can't even call it a ""break"" or ""vacation"" because some of them would rather to take this time to earn a little bit of money to be able to effort for their needs and expenses,

or they might have responsibilities to take care of,Others likes to volunteer in community services or try to be involve in different activities that will keep you busy.

In respond to everything i do think that having a longer summer vacation would be good enough to catch up as much as we can with our old friends and families maybe when we were in school we was't able to see them enough because some of our love ones live far away from us so we take our time to spend every little moment we have lost while we were way and it benefits everyone in general, not just for students.

CCEFC4392340,"Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators think that summer break is too long and students do not retain information as easily as they would in the fall. Because of this a lot of educators think we should have year- round school years. This would be shorter breaks in the summer (3-4 weeks) and longer more spread-out breaks throughout the year. I disagree with this statement and believe that summer break should stay the way it is.

The first reason I disagree with this statement is that it would ruin certain summer activities or even business plans. Think about all the activities in the summer that kids usually take part in, this could be sports, some sort of trip, etc. All of these activities students would preferably do during summer break. They have this preference because they see the summer as a perfect time to do all these activities without having to balance their education as well. They can put most of their time on this activity. The same preference applies to things like summer jobs or internships. During the summer they can learn important values like how to save and earn money. Or if a certain student has a chosen career path they can explore this career path by going in a internship for that spesicifc job. For all of these activities students at the very least would be discouraged to participate in if there was a year-round school year.

The second and probably most important reason is pertaining to the students mental health. An article, by Complex News writing about kids mental health stated, that over 40% of kids by the end of their freshmen year in high school are depressed or overall feel exhausted and depleted mentally. The article continues to say that this number from the time of their freshmen year only increases after each school year. Students use the summer break as a way for their brain to refresh from the long almost ten month school year. Students need this time to relax their brain and get ready for the next year of education. As a student, I can say that during school my brain goes into this state where I am mostly just focused on school work. And I can admit that my brain at multiple points during the year is worn down and damaged by always be in this state. My brain does not get a chance to heal from this until the summer, when school is over. So if we were to hypothetically have a year-round school year, this would mean that the brain would also be in this damaged state year round. If this were the case than the brain of the student would eventually just break and shut down. No student should have to experience that because of a year- round school year.

Although the strongest reason for this year-round school year is that students cannot properly retain enough information for the next school year, I think I have a much stronger counter claim and solution to this problem. A very simple way to take care of the problem of retaining information, is to make mandatory (but simple) assignments from the previous year for the student to complete so that they don't forget this information. This way students can have their long summer break to refresh their brain and do their activities, without them having to forget any information. You get the best of both worlds with no need for a year-round school year.

In conclusion I think my assertions for the summer break to stay the way it is is much stronger than year-round school year argument. Having a year-round school year would be unnecessarily tedious and dangerous as it would negatively affect summer activities and mental health. As someone said once upon a time ""Don't fix it if it ain't broke.""",5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,10.0

There some student who don't like to go to lunch or like to eat and by using there phone they have something to do. The teacher get mad when there standing up by having there phone i don't think they will be. Most kids use there phone in school when the teacher don't look so its better to have the rule about only in free time. By having this rule i think it will make kids be better because if there not then they will not be ably to use there phones. That what most kids like and want to be ably to use there phone in school. Not all kids have phones so to make it far for everyone the rule should be phones and ipods only in there free time .Think this would work good as a rule but we need to try it first. In high school you can use it so why not middle school. Kids should start see how it work with the phones in high school. So they can have in idea about it. But not everyone is going to think how i do but i think we should try it for a week or two to see if it works. But think that policy number one is a good one and a good idea.

We never now if we don't try. We should try if it work we keep it if it doesn't then we just say it didn't. But we can say at least we tried. For some student it will work good but for some it wont. Some will have hard time with it but other wont. Most student do there homework when there testing and do good in there class.

Hello, my name is Generic_Name. I am seventeen years of age; and live in Generic_City, Virginia. I am a student at Generic_School. Currently I am a junior at the high-school. I am writing this letter to who ever this may pertain to, because I have questions about a potential internship at your business.

I am trying to branch out to see what fields I may like, and want to pursue. I was recommended this business, by my school consular. My school consular and the career internship teacher told me, it would be a great idea so i can see hands on what field I am going into. I am a very reliable person. I am currently unemployed, so I a lot of time after school. I have got my attendance and reference sheets from all my teachers to prove that i am very reliable. If interested to see these documents, I can send them through e-mail.

I am very fascinated with the field of construction. Growing up I would love to watch shows like Bob the Builder, and was fascinated by the things he built. I thought it would be an easy task to just build things like he did in the cartoons. I understand now that I am grown up, and have had a bit of hands on experience, that it is not as easy as it looks. I have had a bit of hands experience with construction from building a wheel-chair ramp with my step-dad, to helping him build a new living-room at our uncle's house. That still does not cut it for me though, I want to become a good builder.

I want to learn the ropes of becoming good at construction. I consider my-self very dedicated to the challenges of a task. I think this internship would be a great experience to learn, and get better from. Only great things can come from this opportunity, and I will do my absolute best to learn from the experience.

Also if they have to do a club it might be a lot of time for them and less time of not doing homework and it can be a pain for them because they might have to stay up late and finish their homework. another reason is if the students are going to be very tied and that might not help them.

Also another reason is that it may intimated the meeting new people that can scare them because they are society award and so those types of thing can make them feel nervous. Also it just and that can make someone nervous introducing them to new people. Also if someone forces someone to do something the student is not going to want to do it. Another thing is that students are like there free time and a club would just take the free time down and the students don't like that one bi.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0
40D0F17FC41C,"I believe that it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something that would like to do because if we accomplish something that we want to do that we never has done, then never has to be idle in their life and also if we want to do something that we want to do or make we have to think positive and never give up.

One reason that I have to accomplish something that we want to do is that we never has done, then never has to be idle in their life,however, if we want to be someone in the life then we have to work hard to accomplish our dreams and never be idle. For example, I have a cousin that he has not done the college because their parents do not have much money to continue paying his college,however, that do not stop him he start to find a job and that is how he continue the college because he never being a idle and accomplish his dreams. Now he is in the last year of college and his parents are so pround of him. People that believe in their dreams can be someone in their life.

Another reason that I believe is we doing something that we want to do or make we have to think positive and never give up. However, some people want to be someone in their life and those people that are idle they does not think positive and thats why they give up and never accomplish their dreams. For exaple, when I was in my country I met a girl that she always be a idle girl, when I was in the school with her she never do anything and I inform her that she have to do some work but she never listening to me and one year later she let me know that she want to be someone in her life and I help her and now she is in college and she inform me that she very accomplish her dreams because she stop to be a idle girl also their parents are so pround of her because now very think possitive and she not give up anymore. I believe that if people that think positive and do not give up can accomplish their goals.

Finally, if the poeple believe that to be idle can help you to be a better person in your life,however, I believe that if I be idle in my life I am not going to be someone in my life, if I believe positive I can accomplish my goals. When Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle"" he try to said that all people do not have to be idle in their life and it is wonderful is when people done something that they very started.

805355D5A94F,"My grandma said, ''Study is the best thing you can do.'' This means, if someone commit a career, they need to start paying college and do extra time in school. If students do not commit a career at a young age, themselves will be benefit. It is a terrible idea for student to commit a career at a young age because students can be confuse, students can not think seriously, and students need be prepare.

Many argue that students should commit a career at a young age because students can gain experience. However, they are wrong because students can learn more about others careers and what they want. Clearly students need preparation for study a career.

Initially, it is a terrible idea for students commit a career at a young age because students can be confuse. To detail, Generic_Name was studying a Science career but, he decide to study other career because he does not understand science but, Generic_Name waste two years on a career that he does not like. To add, Generic_Name thought that the career was easy but, the career was not the thing he wanted and the next day Generic_Name leaves. Clearly, students need see the career first, before they get confuse.

Additionally,it is a terrible idea for students commit a career at a young age because students can not think seriously. For example, Generic_Name decide study laws but, he does not really know something about the career and he just go to made fun and that is not right. To elaborate, Generic_Name does not want keep studying and his mom do, so Generic_Name pick the career that he think is more hard for fail and leaves school. Clearly,students need to think about the future but, they decide to be lazy.

Lastly,it is a terrible idea for students commit a career at a young age because students need to be prepare. To specify, Generic_Name is junior from High School and he already have the necessary credits to get the diploma but, he need to finish school normally for have the experience that the college look for students. To explain, Generic_Name lived in a state where the final test does not matter and he moved to other state where the final test does matter but, Generic_Name fail all the test and Generic_Name have to retake all his classes again and in that state any college will accept to Generic_Name for fail the test and have low grades.

On conclusion,it is a horrible idea for students to join a career at a young age because students do not think clearly, students can not be serious, and students are not ready for a career. These three reason prove that commit at a young age is a terrible idea. people must understand the importance of study and have a career. There is only one choice:schools need see what are the developments of the students. ",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,7.0
003885A45F42,"The best time in life is when you become yourself. I agree that the greatest accomplishment, is when you be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else. Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others.

First, you make your own choices by being yourself. Becoming yourself means that you should be able to make your own choices and not be shy or afraid of what you're doing. Because you're defining yourself by doing those things that you want. Some people follow others, therefore, they don't make their own choices. People are afraid to make their own choice because they don't want to get rejected or be wrong. In this world, most of the teenagers act and follow the people who are strong and bullies. The reason they follow them and make the same choices they make, is because they're afraid that they will get beaten up and be left out. Personally when I came to the United States I used to follow other, because I thought they were amazing. But one day, I knew I was walking in the wrong path and I left them. Making your own choices makes you happy because you get to do what you like and what you want to do. It's hard to make your own choices, but one day you're going to have to make your own choices. The more you mature the more it will become easier for you to not be afraid of what you're doing and how other people are looking at it, because at the end of the day It's your life and you do what you think is right.

Second, You become more happy by being yourself because you make your own choices, You take responsibilities and you do whatever makes you happy. Also, some people act like they're happy while not being themselves, but matter of fact, they're depressed from the inside. Being yourself makes you more happy because you feel like you achieved something big. Also, Some religious kids who become themselves love everyone. In the bible it says ""Those who know God should love others, because God is love.""

Not being yourself will get you depressed because you don't do everything you want to do, but you do what others wanna do because you want to fit in. Some kids who come from a different country will do stuff they don't want to do just to fit in, because they don't want to be lonely. Some people are afraid they won't be happy because they would lose a lot of friends for being themselves, but they have to know that those people should be there for them and support them for what he's doing since it's his friends.

Lastly, Respecting others will gain them to respect you. Some teenagers like to make fun of others, not listen to what they have to say, and they like to beat kids up. Also some kids don't like to not listen to their parents, and that is also disrespectful. The bible says "" Honor your father and mother.""

If you respect your parents and listen to them, then they would trust you and not ask you lots of questions. Respecting other should be really important, because you don't want others to not respect you. Also, Some people are disrespectful because they were never respected. Important things to do to be respectful is, Listen to what the other person has to say, Stand up for them, Being friends with them Doing all of that will gain you respect and you would have good friends. Also, if you see someone bullying a kid don't watch, and stand up for them, don't be afraid to stand up for someone because you're doing the right thing.

Some may disagree with me and say that it's not that big of a deal, and it doesn't feel like a big accomplishment. But with all do respect, I agree that it's a big accomplishment because nowadays it's really hard to become yourself.

In conclusion, It's hard to become yourself in this world, because others are holding that opportunity back from you and you're afraid to fight it back. That's why I agree that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,5.0,9.0

For exemple, to be yourself in a world you should be constantly and work hard to feel better in everything. You can try someting new like learng art, or to be volunteer, or you can do exercise.

One reason, to be yourself you should to learn something new like about art. I believe, is a good idea to try enything else, to feeling greates. Because when you try to learng enything different you always to be feeling better. For exemple, if you learng about art,

you can peinted beautiful pintures, and buy to many pictures. Also,

you can to became a famous person araound the world, but for accomplishment this goal you have to be perseverant.

another exemple, to be yourself in a world you should to give enything else. like to be volunteer, in to many places a round the world most people need help. For exemple, schools need people to help with the students. sometimes teachers, and studets have a fild treat, and schools need volunteer to help with students.

For to go to the zoo, and learn about animals they can learng about the biger Giant panda, or about elephants. Also sometimes students and teaches, have a fild treat,

to Washintown. to learng about the presidents, as a president Gorge Washintown. Student can learng about Gorge Washintown, who was the firts president at the United States. Asls they can learng about Mrs. Lucker's

King, he was a great person, And he help to many people. You can feel better to help to others people who need you.

In addition, to be yourself in the world you should to be different, and do enything than you like

As exercise. I agree with Author Emerson. You have to trying to do different things,

to have greates accomplishment, you have to be perseverant. Like to go to the gyn, and do exercise everyday. exercise ca be fun, you can do exercise outside like run, dancing, or just walking. If you want to be heathy, and have a loger life you have to be constantly, responsable, and try to do something else, as to eat healthy like to eat vegetables, fruit and druiking more water.

EFACA593A52B,"Can you imagine a world where every person is optimistic and responsible in their job. According to ""

The Washington Post,

"" 65% of the workers are hard-working and loves their job. ""Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. For example, they look for someone who is responsible and hard-working, and often they look for a person who has experience."" In some countries, start working at age of 15 years old is mandatory, because it helps to young people to obtain new views about different kind of jobs. Everyone has the capacity to be a responsible in their labor, but some people are hard-working because they want to accomplish their goals, and have an excellent record and experience from the last job is so important.

The first reason why is so important to be a hard-working is because you can accomplish your goals. For example, my friend Generic_Name, she started worked when she was 16 years old, she studied and worked at the same time. Generic_Name worked very hard to accomplished her goals. Generic_Name's goals was: be a teacher, buy a house, a car and save money for the College. It was not easy for her, but she was optimistic. She wake up every morning at 6:00 o'clock to go school, and she always fought for have a better future and accomplished her goals. Generic_Name over time get a lot of experience and she inspired others people to do better their jobs. She won a prize for been doing well her job and supported others to inspire to do an extraordinary job. Working hard is the best way to demonstrate you can work in any place and loves your job.

The second reason is when you are working is important to leave an excellent record, because it help to develop a good characteristics and experience. In some jobs, they call to ask for details about if the person have an excellent record and experience. Furthermore, my uncle Generic_Name, he just moved from New York to California, and he was looking for a new job. Generic_Name worked as an engineer in

Village's Company

. He was doing well his job in New York, but he needed moved. He went to apply in this new place, and the employers called to Village's Company asking for details about how he was doing his job when he was working for them, and then Village's Company says ""Generic_Name was one our best worker we had, he was responsible and he have the knowledge about his job."" The new company hired my uncle because he leave an excellent record. Hiring a person who has experience is important, because it help to develop better a job. Some people may argue that be a responsible and hard-working is not necessary in a job. However, be responsible is so important, because people are getting more experience and more capacity to do their labor. Some people do not like to follow the rules when they are in their jobs.

In conclusion, we can not change the entire world, but start been responsible and working hard in our jobs is beneficial, because it is the place where we can inspire others to do their jobs well and any company will hire us for been excellent workers. Every labor is admirable, and we can care our jobs because it depends we can accomplish any goal we has in our life. We can show a lot characters in our work such as: be respecfull, be on time, and the most important things is love our jobs.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,2.5,3.5,7.0
123ABDB6A15D,"According to Albert Schweitzer quote, setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people, or are there better ways, giving a good example to people is one is the big problem here because not everyone might influence on what you do or say, in this essay I am going to talk about how people might relate to people influence, people kind of personality, and people perspective about others.

People might relate to people influence, it might seems crazy, but is true there is a lot o people who really needs help and we never see that, because we only focus on what our self or what our self wants, but we never think about putting our feet of somebody else situation, on what they are going through, or what they have to deal every single day. We all pass through a difficult time and we want to talk about it with somebody, but is so difficult to do it because you are scared on what people might think or say about you ,or sometimes people might not trust you. People who can influence other might feel amazing to know that by helping people they help their self too. People who influence other people help people open their self to the wold and, they let go that stuff that they had pass through, sometimes there are better ways to do it but, just by talk about a situation that you had pass through a lot of people relate.

people kind or personality, is a big argument because, now in days people does not really appreciate what other people had done for them. Sometimes they just forget about the people, who was there to help them or the ones that they helped on opening their self to the world, and let their problems go away.

your kind is one of the big word to represent yourself as a influence to people because , you really want to help them and they can relate to you. When you will do something is because you really would like it not because to had fun, for example a lot of youtubers now in days they, had tell the word a lot of stuff because , they just wanted views or they just pretend something that is not true. Sometimes people might relate to their stories and, they might support them and related to them, or sometimes people might not trust them, but in a certain time they had become someone important to the world , sometimes they go over the line, because they had became someone important. Sometimes they just start acting different, and their famous self make them someone different just because they wanted the views,and want to become famous. Never forget who was there for you and how people related to you a lot of times, because your kind of personality is what makes you big.

people perspective about others, is a big issue now in days because, people judge them base on their look or the way they act, they just judge them because thats how they were raised, but they are wrong because they are not giving people the opportunity to know them or talk to them, how people might ask for help when they are suffering or passing thought a difficult time, when they do not want to open their self to people because they judge them because of their look However, they are not putting their self in their shoes, because people likes to judge them and, they even think they are bad persons. One day when they want to become an influence to others people, people might not want to relate to them because, of the behavior against others. People never think of is that person will help them even more than they imagine, because that person might be the one who can relate to your problems, and have them solve for you, and of course there is always different ways to help.

In conclusion of this essay is that influence yourself first, and than with your behavior help others relate to yours, but do not expect something from people who does not want to help, expect from people the same way. Now in days every party can become an influence, but not everyone will relate to your own influence on better ways that you can do it by yourself. In my opinion I agree with Albert Schweitzer, because on what I had pass though, and I relate myself that a good example by my own behavior will help me influence others, and in certain ways too.",3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,6.0

In this ocation i am disagree with this statment because sometimes people act different like when I firt meet my grilfrind I

was thinking that she was a happy person but with the thime I see that she was not that happy my impresion changes of that situation.

The majority of the people act different when they meet some a person that they going to meet for example, when you going to see a job you need to act happy and smile to they can acept you but in realiti you are sad so with the timethey changes that first impresion.

So alot of people when they meet a person they have a diffferent impresion so the other person can think that she or he is happy or have a good firt impresion or some times you act normal but we the tome you changes and your impresion too.

another reason is when you whent at new school at the first time you act that you are cool and you say things that they like to they can acept you so with the time they going to know that was a diferent impresion.

In my opinion I think that your first impresion can changes, because in the first Iimpresion it is not your self so when you go to work they can know who are you and they going to acept you like that so when you going to mmet a person be your self because that going to be your impresion.",2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,4.0

Author Ralph Waldo wrote, ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.'' with my thesis you will always grow no matter whatever you master beyond and over the moons you will always always mastered something and grow, prefect become great in every ways, However being chanellege is always fun to do.

1st first,you can always master anything you put your minds to be up for the game be prepared always try to put yourself first with anything you do always be careful, be aware, always be comfortable with a confident vibes its always work never let people think you can mastered thinks you always mastered be your own boss in whatever you plan try to it a different way to master it you always master it once so u master it again.

2nd second, You will always grow no matter whats the outcome if you fail to master it just help you to be a better person So, in other ways Emerson statement is just a different thought for everybody got they own position in life one example ""Generic_Name and Generic_Name was very critical in the math exam they already pass but they wanted to take it again they took it and fail, reason they didn't study the follow days so they fail just because they didnt study they fail if you can master anything once you can mastered it again..

3rd third,So its always good to make wise decisions in ever other way doing something beyond in what you already master doesn't make you grow you will always grow no matter what situationship its just help you and guard you to do better and master it again in many other ways thats why its never okay to give up on anything doesnt matter what a famous author got to say ...

That why i disagree with Author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote even if you never mastered it you will eventually mastered it in the future so its always okay to push your self a little hard to be come prefect but not everything can become prefect to master it again ..",2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,5.0

First, People now a days just have a mask on and underneath that mask is a unhappy, sad person,and people live with that causing them to have a bad or a fake attitude toward the people around him/her making the environment not a very positive one. Ive always been told not to be mad or get mad at something it will make that situation 10x harder than it needed to be.

second, Surrounding yourself with positive people, people that have a great attitude ,people who love to see you succeed in you goals or at anything, people who dont bring you down, people who support and love you, people that tell you can do it. Hang around people with that attitude and i promise you, you yourself will succeed be happy in and out and have a positive attitude.

Life is always gonna have its ups and downs shoot, shoot i'm only a 17 year old boy and i had lots of barriers lots of downs lots of fake people that have came in and out of my life but my mother that mistakes are the beauty in life that you learn from them and prosper and grow dont let that change your attitude because it will change the way you think the way you talk i can go on and on about how a positive attitude can make you a better person and be successful in life.

Having a negative attitude is just negative and thats a ugly word being negative can impact you in so many ways at work nobody wants to hire a rude or behaved person because it would make the company look bad make your parents look bad and make you look bad. a negative attitude can bring, negative, thoughts negative actions and nobody wants that. even at home having and bad attitude and mama and thats a attitude you are going to regret when you get a smack across the face.

So yes i strongly agree that a positive attitude will take you a long way. Make you a better person and last make you successful person in life. Stay positive in a negative situation because it will make things ten times worse if you are mad or down learn to heal yourself time a time out step outside take a breather and think before you say or do. life is beautiful but its makes it ugly if you attitude is ugly so change it and make yourself a better. healthier person. i know this is out of the promt but to be succesful in life and to be what you wanna be you have to do that yourself nobody is going to do it for you. but first START OFF with making YOURSELF HAPPY for you not for anyone else.

Sports is enjoyable activity because athletes use sports as a excuses to get good grades, so they wont have to tell there friends that they are really smart.

The reason why is they can express them selfs through music. Some examples can be, when your trying to explain yourself to somebody, you can do that by using music. Such as, find a song that you think tells people of you the most and tell them if you want to get to know me listen to this song.

0A324290AFE7,"I disagree with his statement, because if your good at something you can always put more effort in to it , and you can also be better at what you are good at, and last you can never stop growing of what you mastered . people in general they always get better of what they already mastered .

First, putting more effort can help you grow of what you are good at. For example, i'm good at singing at church. I will put more effort so i can become better at my pitch and the tone of my voice. Putting effort on something means you want to be better at it, and also means that you will like to learn more and grow. Putting more effort can get you somewhere. What i mean by that is a better situation, a better position. There is nothing bad putting a little effort on something that you can get better at and achieve.

Also , You can always be better. Being better is better then good, for example, I am good at cooking, but i can be better at cooking. You can be better then someone ; become better than that person that you want to challenge, or you can challenge yourself. Challenge yourself is a good way to grow. Perfect takes practice; be good of right now, but become better in the future. Taking your time and taking it slow, you can 100% be better. Trust me its not easy to be better that you have already mastered, but there's always way and a chance.

The important thing you need to know is you cant not stop growing; you can always keep on growing even though you are already good at it. Only because you are already good at something doesnt mean you stop growing, you can keep growing, if you try a little harder. I will always try my hardest to be the best at it; no matter how hard it is. There is always a way to keep on growing. If you show others that you can be way better even though you already good so far, they will see that there is a way to keep on growing. Show an example to others; let other people know that it is possible to be better, at something you are good at. Prove to those people that thinks you cant keep on growing of what you already mastered. You will not grow, if you dont put more effort in it, and time. If you just stop of what your good at, then you will not grow.

Remember you can always grow of what you mastered. Dont let anyone tell you that you cant. practice comes perfect. Do all the things you need to do to be better, then you will grow more then you expect. Its never to late to keep on growing.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,7.0
9A757FBBB15D,"Imagine live in a world where everybody is trying to be what others want them to be, that would be horrible, I always will be agree with the fact that the greatest accomplishment for every human is be themselves. Everyone despite where they came from and what are their believes, shouldn't be trying what others expect them to be. If everyone start realizing how good is be themselves, people will be less depressive and they will be happier who led them to confidence,and they will start to accept and respect each others.

Being yourself will make you less depressive,

and will make you happier, beacause by the fact that you are being what you really want, gives yourself happiness, you wouldn't think more about what others say about your look, how you act, and also what you want. You will have confidence in every aspect about yourself as a human being.

When you accept someone that's mean that you feel good with how that person is, but also when you accept someone that's mean that you respect that person. If people try to be what they want they will respect to each others, because if they are being themselves, and they accept and respect that, they will respect the others too. When someone knows how you feel, that person will respect you, beacuse he/she might was in the same sitituation or might feels the same like you.

My cousin Generic_Name used to be what others expect him to be, he also did everything that they asked him to do. One day he didn't want to do that anymore, but he was so afraid of what the others would probably say to him, his mother told him to not be worry about it, because if he try to do so everyone is going to know how cool and funny he is. He did it, and since that day everyone respect Generic_Name how he really is, a good friend, a cool guy and also a good student.

Try to be what others want you to be it is not a great idea and also it's not worth it. When everyone start realizing that being ""yourself ""is one of the gratest things as a human, the society will grow as human beings that accept and respect not only themselves, but the others too, and everyone will be happier and will have confidence about who they are.

A43056665FEC,"American jazz legend Duke Ellington said, ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" Me and other individuals will support what American jazz legend Duke Ellington said, and we will encourage people to do their best in problems because a problem is a really benefit chance for you to do your best. People should also understand the quality of a huge or little problems because it is a chance for them to do what they can do. Additionally, People should also believe in themselves because it is a big conflict where people get struggled in. Also, some people get shy and they give up because of the problem they have. So let us help people fix their own problems because they are the one who can choose to do their best. A problem is a chance for you to do your best because it will make you work hard and you will never give up.

First of all,a problem is a chance for you to do your best because it will makes you work hard. For example, one time in Generic_School cafeteria, I had a best friend named Generic_Name who shared with me her story about her math test. Generic_Name told me about the questions she did correctly, however, there were questions that she struggled in. You can tell from my face that I was so excited to hear from her that she either pass or fail the test. Therefore, I asked her if she either pass or fail the test. She nodded her head and said, ""of course I did"". In that time I was surprised and confused that she pass her test with a high score, for that reason I asked her:""how"",she looked at me with die laughing face and whisper to me,this problem was a chance for me to do my best in the exam. For that reason, Generic_Name passed her test with a high score. Therefore, I understood the concept of a problem is a chance for you to do your best. Even if you do not know how to solve a problem you still have to work hard until you solve it. This evidence proved,even if you get struggled in something you have to work hard until you find a solution. This evidence also suggest, that a conflict is a chance for you to do your best because it will make you work hard with patients. clearly, if Generic_Name did not tell me her story to prove to me that a problem is a chance for you to do your best, I will not be able to understand what she was talking about.

In addition, a problem is a chance for you to do your best because you will never get to the point that you want to give up. For example, one time I read a book titled:""Generic_Name's problem,"" this book was talking about how Generic_Name get struggled in different problems, however, he never gave up. One time Generic_Name was shopping with his friends and some how Generic_Name's friend heard people talking about a running competition, in that time Generic_Name's friend were excited to tell Generic_Name about the competition because they new he love competition. They ran to him while he were picking up a gift for his girlfriend,and told him about the competition. Because Generic_Name love running competition, he throw everything on the floor and ran to register for the competition. When the couch tell the runners where they should stop, Generic_Name was not listening because he was praying to god to win. Therefore, when the game starts, Generic_Name was fast but he did not know where he should stop running. Generic_Name were asking the runners where he should stop,but no one answers him because they want to win the game. Generic_Name did not give up and he was keep asking other runners until one lady hear him and told him where to stop. Because Generic_Name did not gave up,he truly won the game with joy. This evidence shows to not give up and do your best until you find a solution because it was Generic_Name's fault that he did not listen to the instruction, so he have to solve his problem in his own. Clearly, if Generic_Name gave up in the middle of the game,he will not be able to win the running competition.

In conclusion, if you have a problem you should work hard and never give up because it is a chance for you to do your best. For instance, if Generic_Name did not prove to me that a problem was a chance for her to do her best and told me about her story, I will not work hard and listen to her suggesting. And if Generic_Name gave up about his problem, he will not be able to win the running competition. Lets encourage other individuals and ourselves to do the right thing and always try our best because a problem is a chance for you to do your best even in difficult problems.

Its better to foward then moving backwords to put postive thought head and keep moving ahead.

I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to success, it help in many way when talk to someone or when talk to costumer. Having a positive attitude help when working in a work place For example,

when a costumer is giving a hard time instead reflecting back it better to respond with a positive attitude then a bad one. Then matter will turn out better.

when reflecting back with a negative attitude the outcome isnt great it worst it better to smile then be mad.

Its important to have positive attitude because there better outcomes having a better attitude is a big key to success it help when dealing a bad situation. Having a positive attitude change the way you see thing there much better outcome like seeing a smile on someone face because the attitude you gave them was positive and not negative. The action we do reflect on what is said or done, just like attitude reflect back. when giving the right attitude everything is better and there no bad responds or action done.

The important of attitude is the emotion some gives when thing change for example, when a job gives a raise to someone the person attitude change because there happy. Small things changes a person attitude and a way of thinking. when thinking about the way your attitude can change in just a split second by the action taking place is pretty amazing how not only when someone is happy the attitude they show is better then it was before.

The students should be correct, pick a career if you pick a career you is more important as for you self.

in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school but some sometimes not because dont have a money or dont like the school some people have a opportunity to study and sometime not then people probability have a career.

Some students say the students should not correct to a career at young age however people not like sometimes.

This societies not like expected to identify, a career by the time they enter high school people agree, for this case to selected to guide them toward, a specific career or some time much students change a career for other for example a doctor, or police, etc.

First, if you studied a career that you like before and now you dont like it, you have another options or opportunities to take another career for example, I have a friend she is 22 years old, she will to graduate the next year at the age of 23, she is very young and she is thinking to take another career that make her more professional.

Then, if you want to start a project you have a lot of ideas because the mind of the young people is incredible and if you fail it you can try and try again for instance If you want yo start a project like, you want people to work for you you can start something easy like clean houses and the money that you earn from that then you pay to them or you can put a store of clothes and you can to make your own company of clothes or you can have a restaurant and earn s extra money for these works.

They can study and work at the same time and earn money to pay his or her college, they can start a family while they are taking another career and if they learn a lot of things they have their own life.

Finally, I think it is a good but good idea because they become more professionals and they have more chances o have a great life, If you see more of the students are young and they work hard to have a amazing life, it is a good idea because you can help people to give them motivation and they can see you like a inspiration to go ahead.",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,6.0

FFA6690BC309,"Having activities after school are good ideas for students so they would spend the time doing good things and not thinking in make bad decisions and we do not need more bad people in this world we need more good people to succes in this world. Although some people think that schools should control the students involvement in extracurricular activities nevertheless, the students should decide if the student wants to do extra activities after school because students would have the freedom to decide and some students needs that time to study or to work.

First, students need to have the freedom to decide if they want to do actives after school for example some students work after school sometimes they need that time to make money to help their parents to pay bills like rent or water. If the students have activities after school they would not be able to help their parents. Also some students need to take care of their family members like their brothers, sister or cousins. If the students do not help to take care of their family members their parents would have to pay somebody else and that would mean spend more money for them. The students who work are also learning more skills so in the future they would not be lazy and they are learning how an adult life is that is not to easy but they would be lucky because they would have learned that when they were younger. Also sometimes parents decide for the students to do an activity that they not even like which it means that the students would not be happy and they would have a lot of stress is better that if they want to do an activities they should decide what they want to do not be a parents decision.

Second, students need this time after school to do homework or to study. For example if the students have activities after school they would be late at home and they would be tired which it means that they would not study or do their homework so they would get bad grades and if they try to do their schools homework they would stay up late which it means that they would not get enough of sleep so they would be sleeping and lazy at class the next day. Also students need this time to take a break from the school and relax students school's life if hard sometimes they need a break from everything to came back with more energies. Having enough time to study would help the students to improve their skills at school so in the future they would have more opportunities to find a good job that they would enjoy and they make money to have a decent life and support when they have a family.

This shows that students should decide if they want to do extra activities after school because students can have the freedom to decide and the if the students have activities after school they would not have time to study or to do their homework. In my conclusion the life of a student is not easy they need to know how to manage their time so they can go to work or study sometimes they also have things to do at their house taking care of their family members. Students needs to choose if they have extra energy to do activities after school. Students would have a lot of time in the summer vacations so they can decide if they want to do and activities they would know how to manage their time to work and take care of their families member but they would be also enjoying their time doing activities.

Students that go to high school are expecting to do more work and be with a different mind set. Going to high school, is the time when students need to think what they want to do in the future, and pick a career that they like. But there are many students, that don't care about their futures, others don't think about their futures in high school. High school is the time when students are able to get focus and think about a career they wanna take. Also to pick a career that you like,and you enjoy doing it. But there are many students that take career just to take them but thats no the career they like so they end it up not achieving nothing.

In high school, is where a lot of students work so they can get money and buy what they want and Also to pay their college career. So identify a career by the time students get to high school help. Because now the students now how much does the career cost, and where he can go studied when he finish high school. Also choosing a career when your young helps, because students have more time to get more information, about the career. And see if there are others career that students would like to take. So thats why committing to a career by the time you get to high school helps you, have more time to view different careers and choose the one u like the best.

Many student that are almost in high school, think about how high school going to be like. So been able to choose a career before high school helps. Because the student can get their mind set and think about what courses the student wants to take in high school. Those courses can help, because it teach the student the things that he needs to learn therefore hes prepare the career, he wants to take. And also to be able to search where the he wants to go studied and pick the collage that teach the best for his career.

And finally preparing for a career before high school, gives the students more opportunities. So I agree for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. also high school has a lot opportunities, for students that wants to take collage course. So they can be prepare for their careers, and when they get to collage they now a lot about the career they want to take. So it helps committing to a career before going to high school it can get you prepare for your future. And acomplish what you want for your future.    ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,7.0
ABBA50242CFA,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. That might a good idea for some students but not all. Today, many High Schoolers from the age of 15 to 18 have jobs. They work part time to help their parents pay for their phone bills, cars or something else. Sometimes they might want to work more, but school is 5 days a week, they have to do homework every night even on weekends. Going to work after school is very overwhelming. They get out at 9 or 10 depends on where they work, go home and do their homework, then go to bed probably late, and have to get up early the next morning. That goes on days after days. Many students can get stressed out easily. So I think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. Staying at home and study is still better than waking up and getting ready early in the morning to go to school. That might not be a big problem in summer or spring. But winter is the worst time of the year for students. The sun rises later than usually and sets earlier. It gets really cold and there is frozen ice on streets. Nobody wants to get up early and go to school or work when the sun hasn't even risen and frezzing weather outside. Of course they want to wrap around in their blankets and sleep in. But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. Leaning and teaching face to face is always easier than online. You could ask the teachers directly if you don't understand, and I think the teachers would be teaching and explaining in a better way face to face. Plus, you can meet new friends, socialize and participate in sports or any activities at school. So in the bottom line. I think it's better to combine both ways. The students can attend school everyday, except for snow days. They can take classes online since they can't make it to school. Cut the students some slack on some Fridays. They can stay home and attend classes online. Or only apply on seniors. Because it's their last year and they have lots of work to do. But in my opinion. Attending clases online or directly at school don't matter. What matters is that the students find their best ways to learn and relieve stress.          ",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,7.0

to considerate, this model by extending the school day two hours and four day school week. After read the Prompt, I agree with this model by extending the school day two hours and four day school Week. First all the students needed to know the important that is come to the school to be responsable and take each class in time is how we are better each day. The school have a important roll because is the relative things that is the beginning of own future to conduct a right person.

For example; always we need to check our classes, make homework, to be in time in the classroom. many things that we learn to be responsable and should the reflect a right person with good purpose.

Second, to conserve energy and resource many students have a lot work to do in the classroom considerating this is goona be a good project in definition for our education, all us need to know that with good education grow up to be better each day. Consisting of ten hour sound good that we expand our time in importants purpose. always try to get not only one step, always try to do many steps and to achieve each goals the benefits that we can know is our future that always with good purpose we can get better education about all the school, get two hours more is how we can learn more in to be active in the classrom.

For example; classes that we can to do homeworks and undertands the problem in each classes can to be necessary for to be smart and get good grade.

Next, with four day in the school and extending the school day two hours, I completely agree because many students needed to be focus and get more hours can be to important in our education life. The school can save money with the gasoline and our hours of class can to be complete. also, get one day off can should the good student that we are getting more time for to do homework and take it fantastic grade and the weekend is not enought at all because there are many things that we can't to do only in the weekend, specially when we have a lot of homework and take time with the family.

for example; if we extending two hours more we can be focus and get right all the test, get four days in the week make homework, get notes and have fun with the family. the transportation can saving the gasoline and our hours educational are the same.

about all I agree and always, I am focus in my goals for my own future, the school is the beginning of our future in mine too, always try to learn more and purpose goals to be right person for get good work and the majority people special yourself have good feelings. some bussiness have adpoted a four day work week, wit each day consisting of ten hour in specific things spend your time how take it note that it's the way for best life and always try to get good lesson extending two hours and always getting practice at home.

example; to get note in your house in to be ready for the test or some assigments that can be afortunately good chooise that you can do.

In conclusion; to considerate, this model by extending the school day two hours and four day school week, with agree terms to recognize the time that your put every single day in specific what if this time that I am putting is for good future or not, always take it note that the school is the best way for get out and get good careers and good jobs.",2.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,4.0

We have scientists, doctors, firemen, pilots, policemen, chefs, etc. There are some persons who are always trying to do their best in order to improve our society, and everyday new persons are born to live in the world they are creating. Just like everybody else, they will start from zero and the same question will appear in their minds when they grow up,""What do I have to do to get what I want?.""

We grow up seeing and listening different events that happen around the world but also, at the same time, these events start to giving form to our thoughts. All these factors makes us think about our own future and also motivates us to start making decisions that will affect our life.

What is the problem with all this? you might be wondering. As I said before, most of the people don't know what to do to get what they want. Once they've grown, sometimes people don't know what decisions should they make in order to have a pleasant life. Here is when they start to ask themselves if they should ask for help or do it all by their own.

I've seen this situation long time ago. I still remember when Generic_Name, my old brother, told me he had decided to be a doctor. He graduated from high school and was ready to take the next step in his life, work as a doctor and be successful. My family and I were wondering which college did Generic_Name choose, so he could learn everything a doctor needs to know.

When the time came and my mother asked him which college did he choose, he said that he was not going to study in any college because he was going to learn all by himself. My mother was furious but she let him do it, she knew he was going to realize soon or later, which was a big mistake.

My old brother has been always like that, he would try to do everything by himself following his instincts and doing what he thought it was right, until that day. One year had passed and Generic_Name didn't do any progress. He saw how all his friends were learning how to be a doctor in college while he was wasting his time reading books and articles on the internet, which was good but not good enough. His friends always told him that he had to go to college if he really wanted to be a doctor, but he didn't listen just because he thought he would spend years of his life by going, he thought that he could be a doctor faster in his own way.

The time passed, and he never made it, he never could be a doctor. His friends were making progress until they finally made it, they graduated while my old brother, through the years, never changed his attitude and decided to take a different direction in his life. Today, there are some occasions where he tell me how much does he regret about his attitude back in those days.

With this story I just want to make something clear, the fact that we can lose all our dreams, what we have always wanted, just by being obstinate thinking that we are always right. I'm not saying that you, a person, cannot be successful by doing and learning everything by yourself. Of course there are ways to do it but, are you really sure you can do it? because making sure of who you are and what type of capacities do you have is what will decide how good will you do it by yourself.

Anyhow, it is also important to know that ask or look for help will never be something bad. There are people with tons of experience in this world that can teach us how to be an excellent person, they can teach us how to be the person we want to be. No one has to learn or take decisions by herself or himself because there will always be somebody.     ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,8.0

Sometimes, I fell like we should change the name "" world "" to "" different."" It explain the meaning a lot more. our world is different. every living matter have their own characters and identity. Birds can fly but lions can't. Plants, they can't move but we can. This can show us how our world is divided in many ways. This is leading us to conflicts and fights in every aspects. For example, we can see a political conflict between Donald Tranp and the Democrat. Personally I don,t agree with Donald Tranp's ideas and terms. But if my community agrees and supports Tranp's ideas, It is mush easier if I put a new a mask in my face and put a fake smile on top of it and pertained that i am on same track like them witch is supporting Donald Tranp. It will help to avoid conflicts between me and my community.

Every strong person uses methods to accomplish their drams and goals. focusing is one of the beast way a person use it to be on the top of everybody. strong person fight to win and to be number one no matter what the situation is. Giving up is the beget enemy in their life. Not being somebody else cannot be the reason to give up in a dream. For example, If your goal is to be number one fighter, you have to fight first. Even if you have a lover personality. If you want to be a fighter you have to fight. thats the reality. You can't love some one and punch them in the face at the time. you have to switch up to get to your dreams ( to being number one fighter). American secrete service agents go to Afghanistan to catch terrorist. They are not Muslims but they have to dress up like Muslim and learn their language and culture just to make their country safe from terrorist. Being somebody else help them to achieve there goals.

I believe, becoming somebody else, can help you to learn about that someone personality.

This can help you to adapt the behavior of that person, witch can help you to establish a good relationship. For example, I am originally from Ethiopia living in the US. Sometimes I have to act like American just to establish a good environment around me. Thanksgiving is a well know holly day in American culture . But we dont celebrate it in Ethiopia. Just to respect for my community, i celebrate thanks giving with fake smile with others just to create a good environment in my area.

In my conclusion , sometimes we should be somebody else to live in our divided society. This can also solve our conflicts , helps us to accomplish our goals and to be live in any environment. I believe we have to be logic and see the other side. This could be the smartest way to live our life with our crazy the society .                ",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,5.0
66C44F6D4FF8,"What is the best way for us to become successful in life? It's either by always doing something toward accomplishing our goal; or to do absolutely nothing. The obvious answer, is to constantly be doing something in life. The more someone go out there and try to learn new things, is the only way for them to acquire new skills. Which will give them confident and let them take whatever that they learned, and turn their dreams into a reality.

Having a goal to accomplish is easy, but accomplishing it is the hard part. The most important thing is to have the drive of always doing something. This is the only way for us to learn and gain experience. Having the experience will only insure that, we'll find more success in life. A salesman is not expected to be good, if he haven't sold anything before. Thus, experience is the key to finding success; and the only way to get it, is by doing something. This is why many jobs will prefer people with experiences over people with none.

The experience will boost and give confident toward accomplishing our goal. Confident is something that everyone should stride to have. With it, accomplishing our goal would be much more easier and faster. Studies showed that, people with confident are more successful than people with none. Our society also agrees with this, a person with confident is viewed more superior than to a nervous person.

Stepping out of their comfort zone is difficult for people, which is why they chose to be inactive. But doing nothing is basically the same as giving up. Being inactive doesn't help or gain anything useful to us. In fact, it stops and prevents us from accomplishing our goal. People just need to find their determination to do something, this is the answer that they need to stop being inactive.

In conclusion, it's way better to be always doing something, rather than nothing. This will help develop a person,as they learn and gain experiences from real life situations. Having the right mindset will give us the drive to go out there and accomplish our goal. Take what is not given to you, by working hard to earn it. This is the beauty in life and is the reason why we stride for greatness.                ",4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,8.0
9854782DAC30,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, students would benefit taking classes online and have opportunities while doing them at home than the school.

In this case students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home and here are some of the reasons why it would benefit them:

They would be able to be in a different room of the house that makes them comfortable.

Student would have opportunities to go to different places such as visiting a country or a state and still take the class online without missing anything.

If the student is sick, the student can still take the class in the computer by listening to what the teacher says.

There is no need to buy school supplies because everything is on the computer.

Having more time to spend at home.

Getting the majority of work done.

Students would be able to concentrate better, and example of that is that they will not feel pressed by waking up early, thinking what they would wear, waiting for the bus and especially in the cold weather. They would have more time and opportunities to organize everything they have in mind also if the student works, the student won't feel tired and will feel more productive when working.

Online classes would benefit every student in general and it would be great if all the school's offered that option, also I believe that schools should do that but in the case of an University there should be online classes too but it would be more important if they went to an University and learn more than they would in an online class. The reason is because since they are not teenagers anymore they should focus more on learning something that would help them.

A positive way in taking classes online is that only the students can hear you but they don't have to see you in person and they won't make fun of you because nobody knows each other also the teacher can hear everything you say because there is not too many students that join online courses. It would also helps prevent something that we don't want to happen, that is why it makes it more easier.

A negative way in going to a school is that a student can feel tired, stressed or depressed because I feel like sometimes school is all about passing and what students try to is to get their work done to have a good grades and they get stressed, also if there is somebody that is bullying another person, that person that is being bullied can get depressed and not want to go to the school. They don't say anything because they're scared that something will happen to them.

Taking online classes won't make you worry about anything but doing work that has been assigned and also you feel comfortable because you're at your house and you can feel free to express your opinions and when you're at the school not everybody rise their hands because they are too shy to answer it in front of everybody or if you say an answer that is not correct some students might laugh at you. But that is not good because it can make you feel insecure about yourselves.

In all I believe that taking online or video conferencing from home would benefit students by giving them more opportunities and to focus more in their subjects by not feeling stressed of thinking what they would have to wear, if they need a binder or a notebook, waiting for the bus and being late because by doing online courses everything is on the computer and all you do is stay home, pay attention to the class and have work done also it would help students prevent missing classes and feel tired for waking up too early to get dressed. Sometimes when students feel tired, stressed or depressed it can be because they have to do the same routine since Monday through Friday. But when having online courses you can be eating while you take the course, of course in a respectful way, so the teacher and the students won't get bother and this is why students should take online classes.

2265CC4410DE,"Changing the lunches to healthier lunches will effect more then just the cafeterias. It will change how people eat, and changing the food habits which is not good. Some adults and parents might love the change, but as teens it might have to be a nightmare. People having favorite lunches and enjoying what they buy to eat should be the goal. Not having to be inforced to eat healthy food on a daily. The school board should speak, and see all the possible outcomes of this change before making a desicion.

Think of how many kids won't eat anymore, because of this change. Losing some of their favorite foods would change everything. Not only a loss for the kids, but a loss for the school as well. Losing more money as more kids stop buying lunch. This could not only effect the stomach's of the people not eating, but could also effect their learning and how they do in school. Nutrition is a big thing in school, because you need it in your system to function.

Habits are also being changed. Being enforced to bring food from the outside. Some people would probably even leave school. That should be one of the schools biggest fears. They are legally in charge of you at schoool, and if you decide to leave, and something happens to you; that can not be good for the school. There are so many things that could fall into this. People coming in and out of the school with food for others. Random people could indentify as a student due to holding a backpack and having food in their hands, so a student opens a door for them.

Some parents are obviously going to disagree. They want their kid or kids to eat, and do well in school. The amount of complaining will be very untolerable and annoying. There should just be a balance between healthy and unhealthy. For example one line could be serving healthy food, and the other could be serving what they used to be serving. They should be making it work instead of making them unhappy.

I really think everything should be looked over again. Making big time decisions like this could really effect the school. I think many people should have a say in this including high representative students, and very exclusive clubs. Some being National Honor Society, Key Club, and maybe even the the county board itself.

Thank you so much for hearing me out, and hopefully you take my ideas into perspective.

ACEDBB3C81A0,"They say some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. I agree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because some students rather attend to a class at home than at the school so they can focus more; However, some students suffer from bullying, and they rather stay at home and study than attend to school and get bullied again and again. Attend to school at home is a different type of learning is at your own place you got peace.

Attend to school at home is different when you talk about focus, at home, you at your own place quiet, you don't have people around you to stop you or distract you. One day at high school I was trying to focus for a test retake but I coudn't because my friend kept distracting me and that made fail my retake. If I was at home learning in peace without distractions maybe I would pass the test. The point is that studying at home is quiet and calm what can help you successfully at your school grades.

One of the biggest reasons students attend to classes at home is due to bulllying every high school students suffer from bullying whats is wrong but we can't change people we got sometimes you got to change your strategy so you can live a healthy life, thats why some students decide instead of getting bullied every day attend to school at home. I had a problem at freshman year that i've got bullied every time because of how skinny I was and I was kind sad, all my grades went down and I didn't knew what to do;Therefore, if I decided to attend school at home I woudn't have to face this problem every school day. In this case being abble to attend school at home helps a lot of students.

Allthrough, attend school at home got some issues too, when you attend school at home you don't socialize, you don't get to know a lot people, One of my favorite soccer player once said that ""the only thing that attending school at home does not help is at socializing, meeting new people."" that's of the reason not a lot people attend school at home, because they like to meet new friends, being together with people that you like.

Therefore, students benefit from being able to attend classes at home, you can focus more and you is a option that you can take if you have any obstacle in your way at school such as bullying or something like that, nowadays is more common to see people taking online classes. All the schools should have online classes that you can take at home so every student can study the way they want to study;Therefore, students benefit by being able to attend classes at home.",3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,6.0

They wan't everyone to be kind and no wasting act of kindness. My oppinoion I wold at least do one to five act of kind ness a day to make someone happy. If you do a act of kind ness you might get some to say something good about to make you feel good. It is nice to do in genral. You can feel good if you gave some a complement of there self and make them feel good. You can make someone day because they might have had A bad day and you gave them a complment and that make them feel good. I think the auther made this becuase they can make people feel good. The ancinent greek is relly old and they were doing alot of act of kind ness. The ancient greek story teller said no act of kindness no act of kind nees shoud never be wasted no matter how small.

Having self esteem is a positive thing because you can accomplish more in life and stand out of the crowd with your positivity. When you are happy with with youve done then youll realize how capable you are in doing things you thought you werent capable of

Having good self esteem means you arent shy with anything you do,anything to do with other people or just in yourself. when you have achieved something on your own and see youve done amazing on it then it gives you motivation to keep on doing more and more, its like energy given to you after you accomplished what you wanted to accomplish.

Having self esteem from praise isnt that good because you just waiting for it to happen or it just comes naturally which is also fine but its better when you accomplish something because you feel the need to do more and to not be ashamed of your self and who you are. If you want to have self esteem then you got to be you and achieve something you wouldnt do on your own,or something you think is way too hard for you to do.

923BD228CDDA,"Hello, thank you for letting me discuss this issue with you about adding two hours to school while also making it a four day week. I beleive that we should'nt do this idea due to the fact it will disturb the students learning enviorment, by adding two hours will make it harder for students to handle the responsibility's out side of school wether its baby sitting their siblings, work, or sports inside or outside the school system, ethier way the students will have barely any time to do what they need to do with their academics. it will stress the students for not completing homework or not being able to pactice on time witch will cause them to fail the school year.

A second reson on why is not a well thought out plan is the four day week, making the school year a four day week is, because most student do not fully take in the information that they receive on the same day and may need help maintaining the information or still do nopt get or understand the information and with the four day week a student might forget all that she/he may learned over the course of the four day week due to the three day weekend anhd with most studens they have planned their weekened to themself's or to spending quality time with their freinds or family

My third and final reson on this situation is, adults, most parents fear the thought of leaving their kid or kids home alone or with no adult supervision, only to deal with the thought of something teribly wrong in the span of them working witch for most families is eight to ten hours witch will put the parents of those young scholar in stress for their wellbeing and safety. The problem of adding two morw hours to school will also confuse the schedual for the students and their parents for example celebrating the birthday of a loved one will alter the time to organize such an event rushing the child to hurry home not being able to prioritize their academics to their social life will cause them to fail. Another reason is, their sleep schedual will have a huge affect on their body and not to mention academics as well, it will cause the student to do poorly on school and afterschool programs will have less students that are not commited to stay due to their disfuncional sleep schuedual. and for those reasons is why i think this idea is not the best for out student, our teachers, an also the parents.",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,6.0

It wouldnt be fair to the kids or teachers because They will be overloading with thinking, The teachers would get to stressed out, The kids would be annoyed because they wont have any breaks or any think time or even be able to have fun with anything else.

The next reason I think they shouldnt add an hour and a half is because it'll be to late after school to do anything else, For elementry school it'll be ok,

but for Middle school and high school it'll be to late and it'll be at least 6:30 or 7:00 before they get home. With sports after school it'll be even later before they can go home and they wont have time for anything else.

The last reason is Because it'll mess up all there planns . For Example if the kids had a dentist appointment or a birthday to celebrate they wouldnt be able to attend because they'd still be at school. for the teachers they may have a meeting to go to for another job or a kid to go watch at home, but since they're to busy teaching they wont be able to attend.

All students needs to have extra years or less it depend of their knowledge. Some students they can work force one year early because they need this year for extra time for them. It a good idea for students to finish high school in three years because it build their knowledge, and it also set their goals.

To begin, is a good idea for high school students to finish school in three years because they can build their knowledge. For example, some emigrant students when the first time being in united states and they come to high school they don't know how to writes their names. But high school support them, and they now speaking and writing very well English. All emigrant students they see three years in high school is prefect idea for them and for others. In conclude, three years in high school is a good chance for migrant students or for others.

Secondly, is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years, so they can set their goals. For example, Generic_Name student in Generic_School she were very afraid to not learn the language or to not graduate on time. But she only take one year to learn the language, and the rest of the two years she get some ideas that going to help her in college, and not only that now she set all her goals for her future. All students needs those three years just like Generic_Name how she think those three years is very useful for her and for others. In conclude, it very important to have those three years so you can have time to set your goals and learn a lot from high school.

Some people might argue that, is a good ideas for students to work force one year early because it give them extra classes to learn more about the college,and extra time for them finish what they want to finish. This is may be true, however, not all students that need this year because they think is just waste of time. Most of the students they already done what they want to have for the college. Thus, students think three years is enough to entering the college and be ready for it.

In conclusion, is the best idea for students finishing their high school in three years. Students should understand that work force one year early is waste time only. Many students wants to finish school for only three years and entering college, which is is a good decision that they make.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,5.0
C636432ADCE2,"Most people wonder which gives them accomplishment: doing something or being inactive. Although some people might say inactivity gives them more achievement, always doing something serves much more achievements.

However, not everyone agrees with this argument because inactivity provides the purpose. Inactivity doesn't mean doing nothing; it means that people can take much time to think deeply and find better ways to get to the goal. Additionally, there might be support for this position because it prevents some risks that can happen when they do something. It is better to be careful and pause than to confront the risks.

Ultimately, this argument cannot stand because of Thomas Jefferson's quote, ""It is wonderful how much may be done if they are always doing."" While they are always doing something, new and better ideas come out continuously. It gives more efficient ways to find the route for the goal. Furthermore, there is not solid rationale ideas because there is a quote that says, ""Starting is half way to accomplish."" Also, there is another goal that says, ""Regretting is better to be after doing something, not after doing nothing."" As these quotes say, doing something gives them hard base.

I have personal connections to this idea whenever I'm about to start to try new things. Like most people, I'm afraid of having risks when I have something that I've never done before. It always made me inactive, which gives me nothing for the goal. Now, I realized that it would be better to reconcile my fear and try anything.

Given these points, most people agree that they can accomplish more while doing something, and inactivity also gives them some time to think deeply. I predict that those who have their goals will find good ways for themselves.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,8.0
9F401E75755A,"In this writing you will find some reason why, 4 years of high school and graduate are better than, 3 years of high school and compare the opportunities that you can find during this years of high school and also help you to make to take your choice.

High school is a great place to know people that could help you in the future, and help you to reach your goals also high school is a great place to learn a lot of things and have fun at the same time.

In my opinion, 4 years of high school are better than 3 years because you have more time to study, you are able to have a break during summer, and keep your stress lower.

During this 4 years of school you are able to have enough time to study and prepare for a test, if you have a History test you have time to ask to your History teacher to help you, before or after school to make a review or practice, and get ready for the test. This is one reason why 4 years of school are better then 3 years of school, and you will be able to prepare for your next test also you can have some rest in summer.

In 4 years of school you will have a break during summer, and able to enjoy it with your family or friends doing some activities as going to some parks or museums, and any other different activities that you will like to do, and maybe go back to the school with more energy after summer. This reason also could help you to keep your stress lower when you are in high school.

When you are in high school you can stress a lot because you have to many homework and you need to study for a test, and if you take the 4 years of high you will have a lot of time to study do your homework and keep your stress lower, and during this 4 years you can practice some sports or any activity that you like in your school or outside the school and also this could help you to keep your stress lower. During this process of learning you could find people that are not agree with your opinion and they can say 3 years of school are better then 4 yours of school.

3 years of high school sounds great for some people they want to start working or maybe they think it could be easy but you will not able to enjoy your summer because you have a program to follow during summer, and sometimes you would need to stay after school for study, and you are not able to do the different activities that you like.

In my opinion 4 years of high school are better then 3 years of high school and in this 4 years of high school you will be able to graduate and you can enjoy the process of learning, and know a lot of people that could help you to graduate and reach your goals in the future.

2A426B89E8C5,"Unless we try to do something beyond what we have mastered, we will never grow. Some people do not like that. Thay oppinon is what we mastered it is eszy and more fun to us. They are right when we speak in our langudge we can be more funy ,and we can think faster ,and it is way eazy to us. but we will not grow by this way. Let me go throw this step by step. If we think about our futuer we will see that we need to be in better place. Better place require a lot of hard working. I am prefir to work smart not hard. Our education need us. Going to colledge require more work. To get a good job we need to work for it. Even if we decide to get out of the education then we need to work day and night to pay for our home and our car. Work is comming both ways ,but we can work in a better place by choseing this things: We only know it if we try it ,what is we can do, why is growing is important.

Try it is the only way to know it. By this way we can know if it is hard or eazy. We like to do eazy things ,but I am prefar hard things. Eazy things make us a littel bit better. Hard things make us a way better than usual. It is require to face problems ,and do work to beat it to start to feel good in ourselves. Everytime we did someting when we came to do it agan we need to do it better. Focus in ourselves is proving us and our nation. I get a good life ,and I am going to pass it to my son. That is How our nation can be better. Every body must get his own work we here in this life to do diffrence. Our proving will be throw our education. When I wil be a doctor that is mean I went throw a lot of hard things to rach at this point. I went to four years Hs. and night years university. That is mean we can put trust in this man because we know about his backgrownd. What about ourselves? I like to be this man. I like to be someone who get everybody trast. To creat better nation and better people get throw good education. I like education no matter what because, education make us a better people from who we are. For thos people who want to get out of education or to drop the high school. They need to try many times first befor they did that. Because When I go to work in KFC they asked me to stady the system of the stor. That is masn learning is every thing. Even if we drop high school. We still need it. Try to do things then we can say if we can do it or not.

I belive we can do a lot of things. No matter where the life gonna put us in. We need to move on. If we fail in the high school. then we need to move on to a new thing. Maybe we will start to look for a job or came up with a new idea to change the world to better ,and make it a better place. Somepeople went to this situation befor ,and they did good choices. Thay invint the facebook and so mant things. We need to be creative as much as we can. If we fail in a trust with samebody, move on. If we broke up with who we love, move on. We can not stop our live because of something happend. We are stronger then we think ,and we can do better. I belive god put each one of us in different situation to act differently ,and to help each ather. If all of us very smart ,and we becames a doctors so, that is mean no one going to work in fast food. No one going to clean the streats. Every one have his own position. We live in a city to help each other. Comunication between us to make us better. We are different to get different jobs. If I am a doctor ,and I want to fix my car I will go to micanc. The same thing to the micanic If he gat ill then he need to come to me. The man who clean the streat every morning. He is the most important man in the city. Becaus with out him, we can not find a clean way to walk in to it. We can do a lot of things ,but I belive by hard and smart work. We can do more.

growing is so important. I mean by grow is to think by better way. Try to learn from any situation you been throw it ,and toke our leason from it to progress your mind. It is very important to set with ourselves ,and start to think about what happend to us in last two weeks or try to think about our all life. To take the theam from what happent to us sins we was young untel now. That is one way to make our mind grow. We can also read books. Reading will help us to act like adult even if we are stel teen. Teenage alwaus like to play crazy things. This is our age ,but Reading can make someone have 17 years old think like a 30 years old man. Onather way to grow is to ask about what we need to do. Who we can ask? We can ask our father, mother, big brother or sistar. It is very helpful becaus they alwas will gave us the best silution. They been throw this life befor. thay know how we can live it ,and thay love us from the hard. They are our family. we need to see what are they doing ,and learn from them. If we in some cases do not have family. We can look for somone to help us. Ther are a lot of wise men in this life. Go and ask them for help. Try to copy them even to be more that then in the futur. The problem is some of us did not have the good patient to learn from someone eals. Becaus we did not know what they are thinking about ,but we need to be smart ,and chose who is going to teach us. If I am going to chose someone. I will chose a rich man or sameone who gat something no one else have it. So we need to be patient untel we see change in our ideas and in our life, and we need to choes the right one to tech us. growing is very good thing.

To do more than what we mastered. That is going to make our nation better. By working smarter not harder we can do more. Geting a good education is very helpfull to us. We need to try it first then we can do it. Motivation ourself will drive us to do more. learn from others also can make we better people ,and all of thes by to discaver what we can do ,and belive in ourselves. Because when we belive we going to pass all of this good thins to our kids in the future. By this things and many more we need to do what we can not do to be more than we are now.",2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.0,5.0
523130079501,"""Their are advantages of cell phone usage in class but their even more disadvantages to it."" cell phones aren't great for students to use in classroom because it cause distraction and make students not focus while teachers give instructions. Teenagers get so easily distracted by anything because they are careless and aren't aware. Phones aren't beneficial nor useful. Students should use either school or home laptop it is more beneficial and useful than cell phones and in that ways teachers will be easily find out what they have done in class.

First of all, the reason why cell phones aren't useful for students in classroom for educational purpose it's because of distraction; that will bother the whole class ,and might bother teachers too. Since cell phones are one of the rule to be use in class then all have to follow it. For instance, if teacher assign work for students to do during class on their phones imagine what will be the result nothing might be done by the end. Laptops have big screen so that teachers can follow up with their students. With cell phones is difficult for teachers to know weather or not the student have done something in class. Students have good tricks especially teenagers. They might be acting like they are working but truly they are messaging ,and once the teacher approach he/she change the page so they can show evidence that they are working. Teachers are even smarter they know how to deal with students like this. They either sit with them to help them out or ask to come after school if they really struggle and can't do nothing.

In this situation is a good idea for teachers to collect phone before class starts and hand them back by the end. Any advice could be more useful then cell phone. That is also the reason why cell phones aren't beneficial.

Additionally, cell phones aren't always beneficial the reason why is because it distract easily. It cause problems between students. For example, if their are two students playing soccer on their phone how will they focus; they can't control themselves one shout happy scores ,and the one who lost want to beat the other guy who win and so on. Cell phones shouldn't be use at all in class but only with teachers permission. It will be even better if two teachers help out in the class with work. They both will help students pay attention and participate. Both together will be able to control phones usage. It is hard when you are working on an essay and suddenly a message pop up you can't control yourself ,and you can't focus just because of the message you are carious and really want to know what is happening. That is the reason why cell phones shouldn't be use in class just because of distraction and the impact that might happen to students from using it.

However not everyone agree, some argue that cell phones is great to be use in schools for educational purposes. First think about the disadvantage that could happen with this use or rule. Think about others and how that might effect them. Will you be able to control yourself if you receive a text from a friend?. In fact, there are many things that might cause distraction but one of the biggest distraction are cell phones ,however, any other things can be control. Any other device will be okay because it will easy to be seen by teachers. Cell phones won't help you at all however it will bring your grades down and it will bother you. Not everyone have same opinion other have positive view on the use of cell phones. Which is okay but think about it more. Look to it's positive and negative impact on students and you fill find the answer.

Why most students will agree with the use of cell phone in class?. Some student aren't always aware of what they are doing and they are careless. They think messaging or whatever they are doing in class is more important then their grades. Students should avoid all distraction such as food, cell phones, and music to help our society develop.

If all students focus and pay attention that will have a huge impact on the environment.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,7.0

3BB94ABF8E02,"Students choose their career before entering high school! Some societies want students to choose their career during the time they enter high school, so it will be easy for them to choose classes based on what they want their career to be. Although some people might say choosing career while entering high school could help students, but it is not practical because students might not know what they want to do that early or might change their mind about their choice. It is a great thing to know what you want to do in life that early, but it shouldn't a requirement. Students are still experimenting with what they like and are learning things everyday which might help them with their career path. There are a lot of options like: electives, school sports, clubs, volunteering, classes/courses that are outside of school to help students with a lot of opportunities during high school to experiment and choose from different things they are interested in through out their high school student life.

First, schools have electives and sports for students to choose from. This is something students might want to do or like. As students could pick classes or sports they are interested to see if they like it or could possibly consider choosing as a career choice. For example, there are a lot of STEM courses and cyber security classes for electives and different sports like football, soccer etc..

Second, schools also have different clubs that students might be interested in and can join. If students really like the club they might consider doing that for living or something similar to the club. For example, there are a lot of clubs that are also companies like

UNICEF

and many more.

Lastly, there are volunteer opportunities and courses outside of school to choose from and go to which might really help you with choosing something you might be interested in. For example, you can volunteer in a place like the

American Cancer Society or

American Psychology Association and courses like pottery to fencing and more more. There are a lot of options.

In conclusion there are a lot of time for students to choose their career during their high school life and they don't have to rush into choosing a career.

6B9A6E422587,"EARLY GRADUATION

Most people believe that have a early graduation is something amazing, but, do you know exactly what this means?. Only the 5% of the students have the chance to graduate in three years instead of four years. A survey show that after of their graduation the majority of the students don't know what to do with their life. In high school the students don't have enough maturity such to take important decisions and consequently they don't know what to do. Is a fact that the high school is not a easy stage, for that reason the students can not doing possible finish their education before. They have to do the work of four year in three years, that means that they have to go to summer school, stay after school, night school and other options. They have a lot of work to do, therefore they don't going to have many time to other things, like have a job or just have free time. If the students are constantly under pressure they going to suffer stress. The stress is a real problem that always affect the students and their grades, with stress they don't can have a relax life and peace with themselves. The graduation early is a difficult and unnecessary process because don't give to the student the chance to acquire enough maturity for the real life, this gave them too much work to do in less time, and cause them stress.

The normal four years in a high school give to the student the chance to acquire enough maturity for the real life. This time help to the students to growing up, physically and as well their way of think and their perspective about the life. In this time they can understand what they want in the future, what it's fine and what it's wrong, what are their abilities and how they going to develop their skills in the real world, because in this stage they are still young people and the majority don't have idea of what they want to be when they will adults. After high school they have to start their life, a real life because they have to be independent, because now they aren't kids. They have to take really important decision, like if the student want to go to college, get a job, or to be president of the United State, the students have to think in the future, they have to know what way they want to take. Is a very difficult task to decide what do you going to be for the rest of your life when you are still an adolescent, and if you have to take this decision before of the normal is more difficult, because is easy dream but also the students have to be realistic about the options. Of course, the aim of the education is give to the student the help to discover really who they are, and depend of the students to take everything learned in the time of their education and put in practice after high school, in their new life.

The majority of the student decided not finish the high school before, because is not a task easy, you have to do the same work than the four years, but with less time and that is more stressing because that can to be too much, the students claims that if you decide to have a early graduation, you have to work day and night without a break. You have to still work in the important days like holidays, yeah, no vacations if you want finish early. Like once Frida Khalo said: ""The life isn't a race, there are time to everything"". If a student have the chance of finish the school in four years, what is the hurry?. Why hurry up the time in the school if this is the most important in the life of each student, here is where you find yourselves, and is not a good idea to be with a lot homework, test's, projects and many things more, that is too much, is not necessary suffer that. The student have to live their moment, just we have to enjoy each time of the life, the good, learn of the mistakes and live the life. If the students are always working in the school, how they going to have a job in the afternoons for have extra money for the things that they want or how they going to have fun with their family, their friends, if they don't have time to be free, to be adolescents. The school is not a race, exist enough time to go step by step.

Researchers believe that one of the more important and worry problems that the adolescents confront is the stress. The stress can to provoke several consecuenques in their lives such as, nutritious problems, sleep deficiency, they can be angry or tired all the time and in extreme cases the stress carry the students to the suicide. It is not normal that the students suffer of stress. They don't had to have high amounts of work to do, they have to follow the normal process if they want. The students have to carry out their own speed for doing the things, they have to learn that it's fine to go slow. Just care that they enjoy the school, because study and learn new things, had to have interesting and funny, not something that destroy your life.

For these reasons, is that the programs that allow high school students to graduate early, can affect more than do better the life of the students, the duty of a student of high school, of course is have success in their apprenticeship and develop their skill on the better way of they can. But also their duty is enjoy their youth, they don't are adults yet, that's why they can and should have time to have fun, to make memories with the people that they love, they do not have to start before on time, and take important decision that going to mark their whole life is they are not ready to do it. Also they don't can live with stress that is a consequence of have many homework to do, the school is one of the most important things in the world, but have to exist a balance, and the work of the school cannot to be all that you have to doing in that stage. Now you know, the life isn't a race, there are time to do everything. You can take your time, make mistakes, start again, learn many things.

First important thing for success never loss the enthusiasm to make your dreams come true because you're the only one that can make your dreams come true and without enthusiasm you're loss ,you can't do anything without energy and perseverance .There is some people that are success in the first attempt but just because you failed that doesn't mean that you're a looser, you just have to put more and more enthusiasm. you failed you can come back to fix those mistakes and become better and more strong to be more successful.

Every body need to know that the Word ''Idle'' is something bad, because sometimes is annoying. Some people are Idles and that is no good. When we are idles others people sees us like anormal people. If I disturb a lot in class I can look like a anormal person.

Many people in the world are Idle, someones in work, school or shopnig. when I go out with my friends sometimes I do not feel conform. They performance as anormal people. When a boy want to girlfirend he can be idle. The younger people can be more Idles.

I know a person, him is so idle. Once when we were working him was start to talk about something hugly. Boss told him, you need shut up. My sister is idle when she wants something. Many people proceed Idles when they want something.

We can be better if we try to improve many things. If I try to make better my conduct I can be a nice person. If My friends trying to left of bother in all places they can be different.

When you have a opportunity take that because that is your like, Try to have a new opportunity and get that before other person have the same carrier not keep your goal because if that person get first that carrier your life change because you said my carrier stop here because other person won the job first them me,like in my life I have a job but in times is so burn and them said I one to change my job a other more better because not pay me the enough to work their like the all week I work 5 days the that 5 days I work 4 days for my self and is not to easy to clean everything for my self I took with my boss to find a another employed, but she said no because this mouths is not business and thats why she no can to find a another employed to help me, to this point I failure because a not won enough money to help at my mom like pay the rent or help and another object.

the enthusiasm they show you, the you never due back you need to go at front the everything you never give you secrets at others person because that person use and you give him more opportunities he you have thats why you never when I said never give your secrets at person because is like you give your goals house, car and including the family , because all at that person;the enthusiasm dislike your first goal because that help you at can work you get your goals and studying is the most important because as you not study you never get you want to want because the study is the most important in your life, the your grades in your schools demonstrate if you fight for yours dreams or you want to work and never work the you like it, because in times you have a negatives times you go away the you road.

688A392FC20B,"People all over the world are having problem because of how a single person view one another. It has been said that first impressions are impossible to change. While some people believe that first impressions are impossible to change because people do not change that easily; however, first impressions are possible to change because spending a long amount of time with people can change a persons attitude toward someone, some people gives second chance, and it is a human nature to forgive and forget.

Spending a long amount of time with someone can change a persons attituted toward someone. If people spend enough time with one another it can change how a person view someone. When spending time with someone people develope a strong bond in a long period of time. Spending a lot of time and having fun with someone can affect a persons or change a persons characteristics.

Some people gives second chance. People give second chances so that someone could redeem themselves. Giving someone second chance can make a person change personalities. People that has been given a second chance can show who the person really are.

It is a human nature to forgive and forget, no matter who the person is or what someone did. A lot of people are emotional towards something that involve a persons closest friends or family. Forgiving people gives a person sense of decency. For the longest of time now when someone do something unforgivable, it takes a long time for people to forgive a person; although, it take time to forgive someone in the end the person still gives the people a second chance.

It has been stated that people can change with enough time or influence. Most people believe that a persons first impressions are impossible to change; however, first impressions are possible to change because of how people spends time with one another, how forgiving people are, and it is just human nature to fogive someone even if a person had done horrible things.

I like texting all my friends because its like talking to him face to face but your not well that's how i feel and also sometimes when your finish with all your work you have to sit there and not do anything so if you brought your phone then you wont be bored and you can start texting your friends. Another cool thing is that when you have internet in your phone then you can get on your facebook or something you like to get on when you have internet. When i have internet i like getting on youtube and watch funny videos or fights. Phones can really entertain you when you know how to use them and also if you have lots friends then you can text them so it would probably be a lot better if we could bring are phones to school.,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,6.0

Some people believe that most of the people's personality will depends on their presentation or the way that dress up, they think that your knowledge or your personality is base on how you look. I believe that the first Impression could change for the following three reasons; Your clothes or how you look do not show your type of personality, the kind of person who you are will depends on knowing the person and through knowing the person your idea about the person could change.

The majority of people classify the type of person base on how they look, What I believe is that your clothes and how your look do not say or show your type of personality or the kind of person who you really are.

Base on my short experience to know a person takes time and the first impression could be unfavorable in strong relationships or friendships that's why I believe that who you are will depends on knowing the what kind of person you are.

Most of the strong friendships or relationships that I know they were enemies or they did have a good impression about the person at first time but through the time they had the privilege to know the person and they found a good kind of person.

To conclude the first impression is good way to present ourselves but through knowing the person we will find that the first impression does not care when knew the kind of person that's why I believe that first impression could change through knowing that person.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,7.0
C209AAD70DDE,"Imagine if we accomplish more, if we are always doing something. Some people accomplished their goals in life, but some people dont do nothing to accomplished what they want. I would like to accomplish my goals in life; there are three thing that I would like to accomplish: having a success career, graduate from high school with an advance diploma, and studied the area of medical. I dont know why people dont accomplish something in life. People always says that things happen for a reason. There could be reasons of why things happen or not. In my opinion, people should always by doing something. If people accomplish what they want, then there would not be a purpose. It doesnt matter where we are, we could always be doing something. We could accomplish more by: helping our parents, being active, and helping our community.

My first reason, We could be doing something by helping our parents. It would be wonderful if we could help our parents at home, or, most thing may be done at home. Helping them by with laundry and cleaning the rooms, so, they dont be tire that much because they just come from work. Helping them with the chores would be a great choice because they would not be too tired from work. Helping our parents is good because they help us when we were little. By doing the chore is our responsibly because they could be mad.

My second reason, helping our community. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash so it doesnt pollute the our where we live. Helping other people good or bad. Some people could rape you or stole the money you have in your wallet. It depends of the people some people could be hypocrite and some people could be nice. The most important thing is help our community by pick up trash and cleaning the community. Our free time we could be helping the community so it doesnt pollute like other countries.

My last reason, being active anywhere we are. our health is important because if we dont care about our health, we could get disease. Doing one hour of exercise, workout, or something it could be good for our health. By always doing something our health could be healthy, and eat a good diet. Some of the disease are cholesterol, diabetes, and are other more disease if you dont eat healthy or you not do exercise. Being active is very important for you and other people.

Helping your parents is a great option because most things could be done. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash, so the community doesnt pollute where we live. Being active is very important because of your health. Your health is very important because you need to eat right and do exercise or workout. Some people accomplish something and some people dont accomplish nothing. If people accomplish what they want, there, would be no purpose. In mt opinion people should accomplish what they want in life. I hope people could accomplish something in life.",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,6.0
16BE136AB3A7,"In this reason however l goona be agree with a positive attitude is the key to success in life because people in the all word the majority they dont have positive attitude so l am agree with people the have positive attitude, to many people in the word traying to help anothers people to get positive attitude its more better to have more people with positive attitude in the all word.

somethings people always are angry for nah reason but they never know for other people they are bad person`s and they affect people`s around they are not agree, they have to change with the time because if nah good some people when see person`s like that they dont like to see person`s with bad attitude all the time.

For example last time l went to the restaurant with my all family and the manager was talking so laugh and my mom traying to order but the manager have bad attitude but that another manager was nice and said he never get angry with costumers he always have positive attitude and all people in the restaurant said if people are like him they gonna be l gree to go everyday to buy food and my family too they said when people are happy all the time they have secces in life.

Another example for be with a possitive attitude is you have to be happy all the time and smile when people see your face and when somebody talk to you no be inrespecfull wich the person because you have to be nice and smile and dont be with bad attitude people they think they look good but the reallity is not people like that they are not good thats why you allways have to be with a possitive attitude.

And the last reason is you have to help people`s to be have a psitive attitude and your family to because somethings you sister or cousin they dont know tha a positive attitude is the key to success in life you have to be a good example for others in the word, however a positive is very important in life you need a postive everywhere you going and change in life you gonna be a better person and you gonna have a better future.

2F3210D23414,"Students now can take classes from their houses. Schools are offering students the possibility to take classes online from their houses, I think is a excellent idea because sometimes students dont have the possibility on getting a ride to get to school, or it makes it easier for students that have to stay home for personal reasons, or even if you want to take a class during the summer to get more credits and get to graduate earlier.

Sometimes students do not have the possibility on getting rides to school and the county do not offer them a bus transportation system that can take them to school, for example in my country Costa Rica there is not a free transportation system to get to school and the only transportation system is the public one and you will have to pay for it, its an excellent idea from the schools to have this kind of classes that you can take from your own house.

Some students have reasons that make them stay home, such as girls being pregnant, students taking care of their parents that need people to take care of them because they are sick or have any disability and they can not stay home alone, in those cases students can finish their school courses at home and take care of their loved ones at the same time.

Some students just do it to finish high school earlier, they have the opportunity on taking classes online during the summer and be able to get less classes on their senior year or just graduate earlier if they taking the standard diploma, that is a smart thing to do if you are planing on go to college and finish your carrier on a young age, and start working at young age too.

On my opinion I think that having that opportunity is a good thing and a bad thing because going to school is the best decision that you can make on your life, you get to make friends and get to know a lot of people during all the time you spend at school, but not everyone have that opportunity, thats why this opportunity that the school is giving you is unique and can help you a lot, the only thing you need is a computer or a electronic device that can get access to the internet.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,8.0
DD279F25DC1F,"""Oh my God Generic_Name,"" I did not have enough time to finish my power point, me too Generic_Name said. I think our school should add two hours more and we should come four-day school weeks like some businesses they work for ten hours and they only work four days it can benefits students and teachers because, some students can have more time to do their homework, some teachers and students can saved more gas and money, and some students can ask their teacher for more help.

First,students and teachers saved more gas and money. For example, my friend needs to drive herself to school everyday and she needs to pay for her gas. The other day she told me that coming to school for five days is stressful because, she has to pay for gas and she is not working everyday like she just too, so her parents have to pay the gas for her .They told her if she do not start to pay for her own gas they where going to take the car away from her, I told her about how some businesses have adopted just going four- days to work for ten hours and I told her that our school should have four-day school week too, I think that would be a good idea and she thinks that is a great idea too, because she gets to saved money and gas and she do not have to worry about paying a lot of money for gas anymore and her parents would not be mad at her anymore because she would have the money to pay for gas.

Other example can be my Spanish teacher she lives a little far from school and she has to drive to school, but she is having some problems and she does not have enough money to pay for her gas. She told me that if she do not get the money to pay her gas she was going to be absent for some day into she get the money to buy gas for her car, that make me so sad because she is my favorite teacher, she is like a mom to me, and she would not be able to come to school just because she dont have enough money to pay her gas. My friend told her about what I said and she things its a great statement because she would have more time to grade students homework ad would have more time to spent with her family.

Second, students can have more time to do their homework. For example, myself sometimes in my math or chemistry class we talk about something new and it takes almost the hold class and my teachers give us a lot of homework so I think the if we go school for ten hours it would be great because I would have a lot of time to do all my homework or I would have time to study too and I would just get home to relax and I would not get stress because I already did my homework.

Other example can be my best friend Generic_Name, she is taking all AP classes, and she gets a lot of homework sometime she does not get the enough time to finish her homework in class and when she gets home she has to take cared of her little sister, so she does not have time to finish her homework at home or sometimes she has projects do the next day but she does not have enough time finish in class. Generic_Name said that she gets really stress about all her homework and how she has to do it in so little time, she thinks if we go to school for more time she would have a lot of time to do her homework and she would just go home and take care of her little sister, she should not have to be stress about doing her homework.

Another example can be my friend Generic_Name, she loves to do homework because she likes to compete with other students, but ladle she has being so worry and angry about everything. I ask her why does not she compete with the other kids like she used to, she told me because she has a lot of test's coming up and she needs to study and that she wish that we have more time in school so she can get everything done the same day because now she has to take her homework to her house and finished over there, now she does not get time to relax and chill like she always did.

Third, some students can ask their teacher for more help. Like myself the other day in math class we were talking about a new topic it was so hard that I did not understand the topic. After the teacher show us how to do it, I was asking for help every three seconds because I did not understand, after she explain me for the hundred time I was still confused, before the class end she gave us homework I did not how to do the homework ether, so I stay after with her so she could it explain me again, but the after school time is only for fifteen minutes. My teacher explain me again and show me how to do it again but I did not get it, she told me the if we have more time in school hours it would be better because would take her time and explain us how to the work more slow, but we only have like one hour in her class so we do not get enough time ask a lot of questions. Other example, my friend Generic_Name sometimes his teacher talk so fast that he can understand what she is saying, he want it to stay after school so she could explain him again, but he could not stay because needed to go soccer practice he being missing a lot of day because he always stay after school with a teacher for extra help and if he does not start going to soccer practice again, his coach is going to kick him out of the team, he is the only one that has been missing a lot of days, and he needs to get back in track because his team has a really important game coming up, so he can not stay after school for help anymore.

Some students think that they get stress for being in school for a lot of time;however, they are wrong because some students think that if they go to school for a lot of time they would get more time to do their homework.

Some students and teachers get to saved more money and gas, some student can have more time to do their homework, and some students can ask their teacher for more help this are some benefits of why should my school adopt a four-day school week.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,9.0

95ED999794FE,"I think you should seek guidance from those that have been through this experience before you for a ever long time. I would seek guidance from those that I trust like: parents, siblings, or even close friends because they have more experience than me. I could seek guidance when I need help with homework from school like: Algebra 2, Arabic 3, Geosystems, or even USVA history. I could seek guidance when I'm looking for a job. I could learn so much by seeking guidance. If you're determined to get to your dream job and you've got advice/guidance than I believe that whatever you set your mind to; it'll come; also have faith in god as well.

I would seek guidance for health problems like depression. Honestly, you could seek guidance for anything. I think making your own decisions can mess you up. Let's just say that you do make your own decision; but than you fail at it; would you try again or give up? Making your own decisions can either make or break you. Your parents are just going to say "" Well, good luck"" and hope for the best for their kids.

Their are those that would say that they would like to make their own decisions weather they be right or wrong. Others would do whatever it takes to get to the top even if it means stabbing your family or friends in the back. Having your own decisions can work. You'll have no one but yourself to rely on. You have to be independent when you make your own decisions. I would never give up on myself nor my dreams.

I will set my goals high and talk to my parents about my future and the importants of my life's matter. I don't make my own decisions because the fear of the outcoming worries me alot. There's a saying that says "" Work hard, Play hard."" I work to the beat of my own drum when it's time for me to be on my own. Never going to give up on myself. I know my family will support me no matter what.

I prefer to have guidance/advice from my family who has more experience than make my own decisions all by myself; without any though to it. Although, others would disagree and say that they want to making their own decisions. ",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,6.0

The attitude is very important because is your behavior with the another pople, when you talking with one person he go see your attitude, if you have nice attitude he go thinking he is a nice person because he have respect and his attitude is nice and humble, and he go want to talk more with you because your attitude is good, if another day you see that person he go want talk with you again.

For example you go to talk with you father love for first time, the first thing he go see about you is your attitude, respect, and he go said he is a good man for my doughther because his attitude is good he have respeect he is a nice person he will be proudo of you for your good attitude and kindness. He will have confidence in you and respect, the attitude is important if you want respect you need learning respect to the another people and nice attitude.

When one day you have children you have to teach them to do some good people to each them good things to do people and to have a good attitude with the people is the most important thing with a good attitude your children can be good people they wiil learn how beutiful life is when they learn how to have a good attitude and respect people and you will be proud of yourself because you did a good job of giving your children a good education. the attitud it is the key of life.

Attitude is the main basis of life you have to learn to have a good attitude if you have an attitude the people around you consider a good person of values because you know how to express yourself with people and you know how to speak and have a humble attitude. Many of today's people don't have a good attitude, their attitudes are not good, they don't have respect, so people don't know how to express themselves by talking to people about any subject so be kind person who knows how to respect people regardless of age and above all your attitude always has to be humble and respecful what the people they knows how your are a good person and they go to have respect for you all the time. Respect and Attitude is the key in this life Remember these are the most important things you have to know how to use them and especially learn them that way all the children in the world have to go to school to learn and know these important things in this life the education is the most important thing for your life the attitude always has to be the most important always be a humble person above all and respectful.

Bacuse fialling in life is not that easy for same people. But sometimes people might disagrer it becuase if you fail you can't be successful in life, and if you are trying to get a job and you keep failing on what the boss is asking you to do you might not get the job. Even thought in school you can't keep failing.

I also agree with Churchill's satement becuase you can't just success in life without trying becuase life is evry hard to success in it. and if you wants to be success you really have to try in life, there's so many people in life that don't have job,place to sleep or food to eat becuase they did not success in life.

573E39E45177,"Is distance learning such as, online learning or video conferencing more benefical than traditional learning?. In my opinion, I believe that most students that take online classes have a higher risk of failing. Therefore, they have a higher change of getting distracted. Studies confirmed that young adults are more likely to get distracted than adults since, their minds are not fully develop. I also believe that, every human being has a different way of learning and goes on their own pace.

There is positive's and negaitive's reasons about person-to-person learning and online learning. Person-to-Person learning helps the students gain more knowledge and interaction. While being in a traditional classes, you can ask questions anytime and gain a relationship with one another. The negaitives of tradtional learning is that, students attend to skip class, not listen to the teacher, and sleep during teaching. Students attend to do these negative actions because they might be force to go to school or they can not go on their own pace.

Online classes are not benefical but you can go on your own pace. Another reason is that, techonolgy is popular in this generation that students rather be in a device. Online classes have a positive side to them because there is many options online in what you want to learn about, but keep in mind that visual is harder than interacting. Visual is diffcult to understand because there is no instuctor or a teacher helping you in person. I believe that everybody is different and we all learn in different ways and different pace.

Some Students would not be able to attend at home classes because of personal problems such as, not having food to feed themselves, some do not have a roof over their heads, or they do not have access to a device. For an example, there are some students at Generic_School that do not have food at their home and all they eat is school lunch. It hurts to see Children that are not able to afford things in life that are in need such as, education. Education is in all of our life's and I hope traditional schools can still be popular as online schools. In this generation techonology is taking over students!.

In conclusion, I support my reasons and my opinions about, traditional learning is a better way to learn than online learning. They both have Pros and Cons but Traditional learning has been in our lives for so many years and techonology and devices are taking over students. Distraction is what young adults have trouble with, Online classes is not a great idea to pursued. There are many reasons and studies, why students should keep attending traditional schools. I also believe everyone works and learns in their own pace and that is why Person-to-person is way to pursued.                        ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,6.0

I do agree on what Ralph Waldo statement said,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" You should always push yourself to the max on everything you do. Try finding a better and faster way to solve what you already mastered. Work even harder then you worked before. Also try something more harder than the previous thing you did. For example Lebron James, he wasn't rich or wealth when he was little, he had to work hard to get where he is now. Lebron trained everyday to get better, stronger, and put his best on the basketball court so he can stand out from the rest. Even today Lebron James is training to be come the best NBA player ever and works really hard to beat/break other famous NBA players records. Each NBA superstars have different stories to tell on how they got there.

645103593F14,"Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ''success consists of going from faillure to failure with loss of enthusiasm.'' It was the time when London was being bombed by German Nazi. His Ideal of his quote is to moral his fellow people of not giving up. Britian is losing against the Axis Power, and people are starting losing hope. Prime Minister Winston Churchhill is a man of Honor, and a great public speaker. He say that losing can lead to Great success.

My point of view of his quote is that, if you keep on failing on something or been a failure, one day you will lead to success. At the end on the Great War, German Nazi lose their regime and Britian won the war. It can be said that there will be hope in the future if you have the right leader, someone you love, or your fellow people. People need hope in their lives, because they need to believe themselves. There are many ways that his quote can only work on people if they cooperate and have great leadership.

I Agree what Prime Minister Winston Churchill said that '' a failure plays an Important role of success.''

I see alot of movies when they hit the climax, everything change and went down, but once it reach it conclusion, it has a happy ending meaning that they were losing but hope brought them at the end.

People can have communication with family. Sometimes we are separate from family or friend, the technology has be developed and now we have phones, computers and others electronic devices. Just imagine to live in other city or country and not have none information about your parents for weeks.

We worried about the people that is around us and we want to know about family's health. Having technology facilitate to have a communication and feels like we are in home with them and express our emotions like happiness or sadness. we can look them by a screen and tell them how much we love them . This is important because we can see that the developed technology can give us opportunities to be near to the people that is far away.

Technology can have many positive effects and one of them is having opportunities to a job. Some people with illness that is not incapacitated to work in a restaurant,store, or any jobs that require to be strong and healthy.

Now they can have the opportunity to have a job because there are many online's jobs. The only thing that they have to do is to hold a phone and talk. Not only for incapacitated people for any kind of people because sometimes people do not have a transport to travel to their job and they can not pay a transport because they do not have enough money to pay it.

People can have double job because they can be working by online too, for example they can work in part time in a restaurant and then they can be working in the online job's too. It is important because to have a job helps us to be a independent person.

The technology gave us computers and we use them to learn more and have a better education. The children can play many games that can help to have a developed brain,foe example they can learn how to pronounce words and they can relaxed their brain. Parents have to take the control on how many hours their children use internet and for what reason are they using it because sometimes can cause problems, it have to be a balanced time. The school use computer for students and students use them to crate project or to search information. The teachers can teach to their student by watching educational video's or search information about something that is happening in the world and we can be working at home too.

When students have confidence is important because they can turn in their work with out thinking about getting a bad score, Students can put their best effort in their work and they have confidence they'll have a good score. when students have confident they want to participate more in class do class activities, Students having confidence is important because they can have a positive mindset and they have that confidants to teach other.

Students having self-respect is important because they learn how to respect them selves and others, when self-respecting they think about what they are going to say before they talk sometimes students didn't mean to say it in a wrong way do they make them selves look bad and others start making fun of them. when we have self-respect we learn how respect our decision how to talk with manners.

Now i love drawing with a Passion. when students set goals they can get better and achieve more then they can ever imagine they could. setting up goals and achieving is a good representation because it's showing them that they can achieve and do more than they could ever imagine

I am agree with the minister Winston Churchill because failure is not a option to loss our enthusiasm and don't realize our goals. Also,the enthusiasm is a good reason to stay what do you doing in your life. Then, we learn of the failure and that cause to make a important decision in our life.

Failure is not a option to loss our enthusiasm and don't realize our goals. First, the life is not easy and always will be a fall on the way to the hit. Second, there is people that they don't like to see you and the top and they try to cause us a fall to don't realize our goals but also it's a people that help you to catch up our goals . In conclusion, there is no reason to you give up to realize your goals and go up to the hit.

Then, failure is a bad experience but if we try to be positive person and find another way to be a successful person. In conclusion, the enthusiasms a tool that will help to grow up and find the way to be a successful person in our life.

we learn of the failure and that help to grow up to the hit. For example, to failure give to you a experience and we learn about this experience. Initially, what do we learn about our fall that will help us to find out what do we want in our life. Also, we need to decide what do we doing, if we give up and loos our enthusiasm or stand up and continues until we reach the hit.

5F61ED998132,"My dad once told me this wisdom

"" Don't judge a book by its cover "" I know it is basic, but at the same time it is meaningful, too. This wisdom explains that you should never state anyone's or anything's characteristics by their looks. Advises and experience are bases of our lives because learning from each other helps you in life and people who likes to share have to be truth worthy.

Learning from someone is a main factor that keeps you from making the same mistake over and over or maybe advise could even prevent it. Older people will give you better advises than younger, because they have tackled more difficult problems. The person who you listing to has to have an experience in that area, and has to be close with so you can trust him. For example, because my dad plays soccer, he gives me a lot of soccer advises. The reason why trust him is that he plays soccer since he was a child. The main point is that you need to trust someone in order to succeed in you life, also by trusting someone you can gain experience and this one thing why learning is important.

People is a very important and helpful source, because people say with their heart. Of course you can search it on internet, but would it be as helpful as a real person. Because nternet don't have any background that you can relate with, for that reason people way better at advises than internet. For example, I was really stressed before this test so I searched "" How to not stress before test "" it showed me to get a good night sleep and eat healthy food before test and it is true. Because I have studied earlier, my dad told me to forget about the test and it really help. At the end it is really your choice to listen to people or not.

Listing ans sharing to the people are good abilities, but in order to use it this two characteristics you need to have different criteria. Finally I am going to ask you what ability would you like to have.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,8.0

The second thing is that make yourself happy, life is tired you will not happy if always have a negative attitude in life, no one can make you happy except yourself. The last one is some people think they are having very bad life, they always get the worse thing than other people, and they want to give up but if they looking around them they are not the one have the baddest life. Follow that way you will never become success.

When you do a good thing make everyone happy and you will feel like you are so cool, you are very good, anyway you will feel happy because you was did a good thing and when they happy they will give their love, their respect. They like you and when you get in trouble they will help try their best to help you without your money like the way you make them happy. Or the long time no see they still remember you in the good memory, and not forget you make feel you important in the world everyone not forget you, that is the success in life.

That mean they want you to live the most happy you can because they know they can't go with you or following you forever. The success not mean you become you must be rich or must become famous, you can think it the easy way is make yourself happy. For example, when you rich but you not live positive attitude and people not respect you, love you, support you, or you always worry about your money, you get stress or some people always say they love you but for real they just love your money when become poor they will leave, I am sure you still not happy for that way.

People think they have very bad life and always think the worse thing that the negative attitude and it will go with you forever and you never have the better life, the life you want and you never become successful. Why people always say never give up or you don't know how far you can touch your dream, you think it very far away, some it next to you but you just don't take your chance and your time to finish your dream. For example you think you don't know or not good at anything, why you don't try it? whatever you are you still not doing great for the first time just do your best, you can do better for the next time, you will never know what you can until you try it, you believe you could and you did it. When you touch your dream by hard-working, and you will know the challenge in the life make you grow up.

in conclusion, the success in life is can be base on the attitude you have, the positive is always good thing for your life, that make you life is easier don't make you life become too hard. The first of all you need make yourself happy, then you can make other people happy, finally don't give up make your life going up by your hard-working if you can do all of those thing you are successful not by your career or your money but by your good energy and positive attitude make it become success.

C5DE10EA489B,"Having a positive attitude you can find the key to success in your life because, having a positive attitude can influence your life a lot and for a good reason. As I know positive attitude is the key to success in life.

In many ways attitude can help to success in your life. for example with a positive attitude people can be more secure in their life's. They can make a good decisions at work or somewhere else. Also they can be more friendly with other people. Some people can be more secure in their life's with a positive attitude.

Positive attitude can help them in school. For example students with a good attitude can have a good behavior in school, they can obey directions from the teachers and respect their classmates. Students can have a good grades in their classes. Also students can stay after school for homework or for help their friends with their assessments. Students with a good attitude can influence in school for a good thing and in that way can influence other students to have a good attitude.

While some other people think with a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Other argue that it's not always being positive. There are several ideas that can improve this thoughts as positive attitude not influence in success in life. It's not always being positive.

For example sometimes some people need to have a bad attitude because other people are mean. Sometimes some people has a bad attitude because they have problems with their families. sometimes students have a bad attitude because they receive bullying in school. Some people has a bad attitude for the action of other people and that affect them.

I think that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. People can decide a good decisions and that can me them successful in their life. Also they can socialize better with other people. In conclusion having a positive attitude people can be more creative with their ideas, they can think better their decisions and also can be more socialize with other people and that make them better persons in life.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,7.0
82F7210163B5,"When learning at school with other students who cause distractions it is always hard to focus would you be able to focus? Even though going to school makes you socialize with friends and they feed you it sometimes is hard for a student to show up to school or even learn.

For me I would rather work on my assignments and others things my teacher would like me to do at home reason why is that some students would not be able to focus especially when a student is causing lots of noise making it hard for you to focus on your assignment. Another reason is that some students could live far from the school making it hard to get to school everyday. Finally students could have more time to work and study making it easy for students to revise in a quite place at home.

Students could limit distractions in many ways at home one way is that they can put on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Some teachers hate when students have their phone out or when they are listening to music so begin at home may cause the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate.

Some students could live far away from the school and may not have a reliable ride to take them to school everyday. Some students can't catch the bus because the bus is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school everyday you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because you are worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught.

Finally students could have more time to study and work on their assignments sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to understand the what he or she or supposed to do. Also teachers may not give as much time for students to finish assignment working at home makes it easier because you have as much time as needed for you to complete your assignment and also for a student to revise over their work before turning it in to the teacher students may not be able to turn in assignments on time depending on the assignment this makes a student very stressful because they do not want to turn in the assignment late and get a late grade for it. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flunking and they need to get it up to graduate or move on to the next grade level.

Although going to school could very exciting for a student or very happy to see friends your happiest place is home and if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student.

And when we do that, the only one who will get hurt is us, if we are and behave exactly as we are may be there won't be too much people around us but that is not the most important accomplish, the most important accomplish is when we learn how to love our self and be who we are no matter if there won't be a lot of people surround us, if someone will loves me it has to love me for who I am not for who I pretended to be.

Everyone in this world deserve to be love for who they are, no one needs to be someone else to be love or accepted , we have to stop trying to be someone else just to fit with a group of people because if you're not like them, then that's means that you don't belong to that place. Been who we are is what makes us special, there are no specifics forms that forces you how to be, pretending it won't make you happy. Just will make you feel that you don't deserve to be love, it will make feel desolate, it will make you feel that you are not funny as the rest of your friends. But when we learn how to be our self in this world where it constantly triying to make us feel or be someone else it is the greatest accomplishment, because when we know how love our self for who we are and how we look then we will be capable to love someone else for who they are not for who they pretend to be.

Feeling like you don't deserve to be in this world is not the best feeling sometimes all you wanted to do is just go to a place where nobody knows you, where you want to start over again and do what you really love, be who you are and if someone gets to knows you it will accept you the way you are but something that we can't see is that we don't actually needs to go to the other side of the world to start over because we can try to start with our self, we have to start loving us the way we are. Why do you think that sometimes we feel desolate too? Do you think that is because we are been honest we our self? It is important to ask our self that question because it makes us think about our self for a minute and forget about the rest of the people about what they would think of me, most of the time we forgot about our owns feeling about how we gonna feel at the end if we do or behave the way that the society is asking us to do. And when we forget about our self that is the time when we feel desolate, and what can fill that what we think is missing? Is learn how to be our selves. If you're not funny as they want you to be or they might say that you have to be like the rest, that's not right because you will make yourself to a side and you will start been someone who's not you, someone you don't love but you have to be that way so you can be accepted and when that happen you are losing the greatest thing you have inside of you to give... Been who we are maybe it won't makes us see the perfect person in the world but it will make you happy to know that you have accomplish the greatest goal! Which is to be yourself in a world that always wants you to be someone else. Now that I had learn how to love myself I'm able to see that everyone deserve a change to be themselves, to show what they have, learn how to be you it also help you to see the beauty in the rest of the people that is surround you it also makes you free to stop thinking that they need certain things to be love or accept.

Will this is why I think that allowing the students to have there phones with them is ok.

Another is if they need help with something and on one is with them . Now I what you might be saying that the students are never going to leave their phones not even if there in class. will there can be a punishment to that person that dose not flow the rules.

To begin, it is a wonderful idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter to college because people finish his studies early. For example, my cousin was a great student in high school, and he achievement to make all the work that he needed for graduate in three years, and go to the college.

BA71C09852E8,"Generic_Name is a student that just finished middle school and is getting prepared to start high school. He is really excited to find a career throughout high school and knowing which one would suit him best. Unfortunately after he told his parents, they were not amused with his response. Generic_Name was sad that his parents didn't encourage him and wasn't as excited to find a career as he was before. Although some people think that it is ridiculous for students to identify a career at a young age, they are wrong. Students with benefit in knowing to identify a career because this will improve their knowledge, learn new skills, and teaches them how to make their own decisions.

Students will be able to improve their knowledge whenever starting high school because this will get students to be prepared for any task at any time. Students are also going to be noticing that there are more opportunities throughout the school and have the option to choose what suits them best. Students can be able to notice that high school many students really improve from freshman year to senior year and can compare how much they really care about the students education. For example, Generic_Name is a sophomore and is looking at a career to become an English teacher, but he hasn't really improved as much in his English class. He talked to his English teacher about it and wanted to get tutored and really know how to become a teacher. In less than two months, Generic_Name has improved so much in English and is finally understanding what to do and feeling confident that in the future he will become a teacher. Students will also benefit at finding a specific career if they learn new skills.

Students will be able to learn so much throughout high school and especially learn new skills. Many students whenever they start high school they can learn new skills, for example: playing an instrument, playing a sport, or even learning how to cook. Students will also learn new basic skills, weather its Math, Science, or History. Students can also learn new skills if they could join a club or activities throughout the school. Students will have the opportunity to learn all of these skills and could really help them out to find a specific career. For example, Generic_Name is a senior and wants to find a career about becoming a guitarist, but his teachers were concern due to how magnificent he is with Technology and Science. Generic_Name wasn't really interested in those careers and has told his teachers that he wants to play for the world. The teachers we're upset with Generic_Name but understood that he made his decision and we're still happy and proud of him. Generic_Name was glad he finally found the perfect career for him and was very happy with it. Students will have the chance to make their own decisions in high school.

High school really wants students to make decisions and teach them that they are becoming young adults and need to understand that they can also make decision on their own. Students will be able to have the decision to go for a standard diploma or an advanced diploma. Students also have the opportunity on weather to choose to go to the army or work whenever they finish high school. Another decision students will get is what career will suit best for them. Teachers really help out students with finding the right and best career for students. For example, Generic_Name is a freshman and really wants to graduate with an advanced diploma. She is doing really well in all her classes and teachers are recommending her many careers. Generic_Name decides to go to see her counselor about which career would she enjoy best. Her counselor tells her that it is her decision on what does she really like to do and recommends her great careers. Generic_Name really struggles on what to choose but will sooner or later realize what she wants to do.

Students will be able to achieve more intelligence, learn more tasks, and open new opportunities for students to know how to identify a career. Generic_Name started high school and isn't too happy about it. He is doing decent in his classes but isn't feeling confident about finding a career, but one day whenever he got home his parents decided to find him careers and told him that they have all their support and will encourage him no matter what. Generic_Name is filled with joy and encouragement that he started to improve in his classes and is starting to find a career that knew that he would love and enjoy. He went to go talk to his counselor about careers and Generic_Name heard so many options he didn't know what to choose, but in the end he finally made up his choice and chose the career he know he would love.

That saying means, do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose. Most people believe that inactivity does serve purpose and here is why; it would allow our brains to rest, and without rest you would eventually pass out from exhaustion and your brain won't function at 100%.

One of the reasons why people agree with inactivity serving a purpose is, it allows our brain to rest. For an example, when you had a stressful day at work you'll want to relax and do nothing at home. Doing that will allow your brain to relax and understand thing better and you'll go back to work stress free and become ready for the next day. Also, when I was in the 10th grade I got really stress out about not going to the next grade. Until I took a day and did nothing school related, cause of that I finally realized that I can get after school help so I can be on track. This was one of the reason why inactivity serves a purpose.

The last reason why inactivity does serve a purpose is, without rest you would eventually pass out from exhaustion and your brain won't work at 100 percent. For example, there have been cases that people have pass out from working too hard and not getting enough sleep. Also, if you don't rest your brain your brain won't function at 100 percent. It has been proven that 95% of people that pass out are mainly cause from exhaustion.

Thus this is why you should rest and relax time in time again.

Some people may say, you do accomplish more by working like gaining more knowledge. However, it has been proven that people pass out due to lack of sleep from work or school. Also, you shouldn't risk your good health just to gain more knowledge.

In conclusion, being inactivity serve a major role in your mental health. Being inactive would allow your to rest, and without proper rest you would eventually pass out from exhaustion and your brain won't function at 100%.

D464E294DDB4,"Our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. For example family has a very huge impact on who you become as A person because you are with them every day. Another big impact on our life is the community we grow up in.

We do not get to choose who our family is therefore thats beyond our control. Family can influence you to either be a great person or A horrible person. For example If you grew up watching your father abuse your mother, you have a higher chance of putting your hands on females. How ever if you have kind, loving parents you have a higher chance of becoming a nice, loving person. Keep in mind we are with our family everyday so were most likely going to end up like them.

We can't choose our community either therefore its beyond our control. Personally I feel like the community we grow up in has a huge impact on our life because it determines the kind of people you grow up around. For example if you grow up in a bad neighborhood you will be around gangsters and drug dealers. As a kid you may think selling drugs is fine because you seen other older kids do it. Selling drugs is going to result in you going to jail which means your going to be around other bad people which is most likely going to have an influence on the person you become.

Others may think seeing bad should inspire you to be better but unfortunately it is not that simple. Your character is usually built over the years not over night.

I feel that working in a group has more benefits as it could really help save a lot of time if it is a big project as the work could be divided and all the members could choose to do what they could do best. As if I am working alone and at some point I don't know how to do something and not understand it then that wouldn't be alright as I would be the only one working on it.

Working with a group could be more beneficial as if we are discussing something or doing something and we don't understand what to do then we could always get some help from our partners and we could get to learn new things that we didn't knew. While discussing with our group we could get to see how others look at something and we could learn about new stuff as everyone have their own perspectives. Working in a group could really save some time as all the work would be divided and the people would choose what they are best at as it would really increase the efficiency and there would be more chances of getting it done correctly. There would be less chances of conflicts as the people could choose what they would like to do.

I

support working in a group over working alone as working alone might take more time than working in a group. If you are working alone and you don't understand something then there would be some explanation and help needed for that. I was given a science project and it was to work alone and when I was at my place working on the project alone and I couldn't understand something so I started searching it up but I was not sure if it would be correct or no so I had to stop right their and go to school the other day and take some help from my science teacher. This experience of mine was not that good as it took me more time than it would have taken if i was working in a group and when I was working at my place there was no one to help me and if it was a group project I might've had my group to help me with it and get it done on time.

One time when I was given a project for my Business class that was a group project and we were three people altogether and we were working together on the project at my friends house and we discussed the whole project that how are we going to present and what details to add to it and then we chose what part is each of us is going to work on and wherever anyone of us had a confusion we helped eachother and after doing our parts we looked at the whole project and the other day we had our project in one of the best projects in our class.

Another reason is great learning experiences for yourself and finally you will help yourself throughout the future.

The first reason is that you will gain more trust and respect for yourself. As you grow everyday you will learn more about yourself and what you like as a human being. So once you try something beyond what you have already mastered and try your best to secede it then you would want more for yourself and try something new. Once you try something new you will think of the last time you seceded in something and trust yourself that you will complete the task at the end of the day.

Another reason is you will gain more experiences in your life. Every time you go through something in your life no matter how big or small the situation is,you will always learn and get more experience from it. Experience is something that you had to live for ,and live in the moment to see exactly what you were doing. Even if you mess up or not in trying to do something that you havent mastered yet,you still have that experience in what you have already been through.

The last reason is how you will help yourself in the future. As you get older the more you know,and the more knowledge you know. Although lets say in the future you got a new job that pays very well and for that job you need to do something in a specific way that you never did or learned before ,Would future you give up or would keep practicing until you get it complete? To me, I would not give up on myself,I would keep going and with all the experiences I would have by then and trust myself throughout the entire process.

This quote relates to me because I have been in this similar situation. In one of my elective classes,JROTC I was a great marcher,but when I wanted to join the drill team I needed to become better. Even though I was already a great marcher I had to step my game up. I worked hard,went to the practices,learned more about myself,and grew. By the end of the year I became one of the commanders on the drill team with all that work I put in and trusted myself within the process.

Finally,I do agree with author Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote because you will gain more trust and respect towards yourself, get great learning experiences for yourself,and you will help yourself in the future. That's why I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote.",5.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,10.0
E34E1B7D1691,"""I want to be a singer!"", is what I told everyone, at 8 years old, I wanted to become someday. As I kept getting older, I started exploring more career opportunities that I could achieve someday and my interest started to grow. With high school and the programs and opportunities that they give us, It is tough to choose between the one I want the most. I wouldn't want to risk any of my hard work into a career that I would end up disliking. With that being said it would be a huge honor if I you could give me the opportunity to visit and get to know about the work that interest me.

While many students at my age have already decided what career they want, I am not sure enough to make a decision yet. However, I know that this program will help me decide what is best for me in the future, by learning the skills and requirements to the career I may be interested in. This program would help me sign up for events, classes or even trips to the road of my success.

In fact, even by talking to someone with the career I am interested in would help my knowledge. Also, it would help me narrow down between which career I would most likely succeed in.

The dedication there would have to be behind getting to where I belong to with your help, wouldn't be a problem at all. With the skills I have already learned with being in high school, I would already know how to manage my time with my career and real life. Your help wouldn't go to waste but would lead me in the right direction to my future. On the other hand, this career might persuade me to become an artist and not to have given up on that dream I once had. I am pretty sure that if you and of course, myself see an improvement in getting involved with music, and having a huge passion, you could help other dreamers like me in the future. Most importantly, by helping them find the right path for them.

Once the choice has been made and there has been improvement with the work I have put in and also being sure with what career I want in my future, I would gain more passion and inspiration. This would help me to push until I have accomplished everything I have worked for. I couldn't of made it without this program though, this company could help me a lot if you give me the chance to show you that it would be guiding me in the right path. With the opportunities you give, that not everyone sees, I may become one the greatest artist in this generation.

I am hoping you really consider the motivation I have behind this, to do whatever it takes to explore my options out in this world.

With that being said, It would be an honor to have the opportunity to explore the options in my career with your help. By leading me in the right path, and by not doing something I am not sure about and letting that go to waste. I would be able to develop the skills you guide me in and also by keeping me on track. The road this company would lead me in would help me become successful. May you please give me the opportunity to suceed? I would love to have your help by keeping me on track to my future.               ",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,9.0

Sample when you read a book that has no pictures in it you use you imagination to see how the book would look like with pictures. Imagination is like your world that no one can get into but you. Imagination is how you think in ways that you understand. Knowledge is what you know and how smart you are.

Imagination makes it easy and fun to learn. Imaginations are pictures in your head that make things easy for you you understand and imagination is not that much important then knowledge. Knowledge is how you think and imagination are pictures in your head that makes it easier for you to think.

Knowledge is the way you think and smarts but its so boring when you sit down read a book without no pictures. When you go and try to do your homework its going to be so boring because the only thing that your going to think about is completing your homework and Turing it in. Knowledge is really helpful in life gets you through school and gets you a good job.

Imagination is pictures in your head that make things easy for you and makes things fun to. here's a sample you playing hide and seek and you are hiding and your trying not to get caught and then you think about a movie of a spy and you pretant to be that spy and then you do every thing the spy did to try not to get caught it makes the game more funnier for you. and when you read a book that has no pictures you can always imagine it.

So do I agree with Alert Einstein or disagree? i agree with him because you have to enjoy your life make the most out of life and when life gets boring just imagine something thats fun. knowledge is very helpful and Imagination but when their both together its a very good comanation you get to have fun while doing you work and you get to finish it on time while your have fun.

E103955391AB,"Yeah we all have our own freedom but well that's not always true a lot of people let others control them. So it is said

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment""

Like i said we all have our own idividuality that what makes us we have our own way of being, own name and own way of looking we are just our selves. Specifically individuality shows us that not everything should be given to you if you want something you work hard for it but also it's a sign of your own development that you can do everthing by your self but it's because you are who you are and no one can change you. Therefore, itis proven that it's better to be individual than anybody else just giving you everything by hand .

""FREEDOM!"" is a good word all of us love to hear. When you realize you can do anything by yourself you feel like no one can stop or as free as the wind but theres always going to be obsticles without a doubt. To be Indivdual it can happen to any one such as a kid who has learned to do thier stuff alone or when you move out of your parents house and get your own home. It honestly can happen to anyone becuase thiers so many types to define the word individual. well to fell free is not a bad thing after all .

When your individual you mean something to this world because you think about yourself. You set your own goals and accomplish them and you maintian yourself the way you are it's even more better becuase it's the hugest goal anybody should have to not let anybody change you wreck all you have accomplished. To your self you feel like you value your self and it's not bad at all to value yourself because it biulds self confidence within you and that means you have you feet on the ground and yeah your ready to face any obsticale.

No one should define you except you because the world will defenitly try to change you but if you don't aceppt it won't happen like Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" whom we have someone to look up to and understand that to be inividual is okay.",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,6.0

BB5B620E38E6,"Is staying committed to a career at a young age a good idea? In some societies they help the students towards their specific career that they want also they help them with their studies therefore,I don't think this is a good idea for students to stay committed to something at a young age.

One reason would be that the students can easily change their mind fast. For example, they can start to get interested in something else half way through high school and they want to start learning about what they got interested in. Or after high school they decide not to stick with that career anymore because they have found something that has interested them more than the one they studied for. Young students can be very undeceive also, being young may have an effect on them not not knowing what they want to do.

Another reason is that some students don't know what they want to study yet. For example, they may have many options and they can't narrow it down towards one specific career they want to do. Also,students may want to have an open mind about the varieties of career there is in this world and see what catches their attention more then the others because this is something they would want to continue doing or perhaps, they have no clue what they want to do in the future therefor, Young teens can be very clueless on what they want to pursue in the future.

Although, many can argue that starting at a young age is a good idea because, they can easily start working for their career they have studied for or easily get into university to get a higher standards and they can work to start to be independent and they can be proud of what they have achieved in life so far at a young age. Even though, this may be a valid reason. Others may say different For example, that the students are to young to start thinking about what they want to do for the long run and how they should not be thinking about that yet until they become a senior in high school. Also, it is not good to be stressing at such a young age when you can worry about it later on in life.

Being a young teen in high school is hard to stay committed to something that you dont know if thats what you want to continue pursuing. You can easily change your mind on what career you want to stick with. Over all everyone has their own opinions but this is my opinion. What do you think about starting at young and starting to study about the career they want to continue in and actually staying committed to it?",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,7.0

EDA0DCA3FC41,"I don't think that school districts should allow students to graduate early. I believe that this is a bad idea because students have to take more classes than what you usually take, students would have to stay after school or maybe even take summer school, so they can get enough credits to graduate early, and students would be very stressed having to learn all this material for each of their classes, since they won't be taking any electives. For these reasons, I don't think school districts should allow students to graduate early.

Students who are graduating early, will have to take extra classes during the school year, so that they can earn the credits for their classes. In many schools, you have to have at least four credits in one subject, so that means the student will most likely have to take two classes of one subject to earn the credits for that one specific subject. Some students graduating early, might have a difficult time being all caught up in each of their classes, which can lead to them having to stay after school to take tutoring classes in case they don't understand the material being taught.

Most students, will either have to take school during the summer or they stay after school to take extra classes. Students who stay after or do summer school do this, so that they can earn all the credits they need to graduate early. Students who choose to do summer school don't have to take that many classes when they go back to school, since they already took some classes during the summer. Students who choose to stay after school to take extra classes, will have to stay in school longer, so they can learn all the material for the subjects that they are taking after school.

Students will be stressed and under pressure when it comes to learning and studying for each of their classes. They will be stressed because they're going to have to study for a lot of their classes, when they take tests and sometimes they can have tests in multiple classes on the same day, which means they are going to have to study for multiple classes. Same thing applies with homework, they will feel under pressure to get all their work done. They wouldn't be taking any electives, so that means all their classes will be hard, since elective classes are usually easy.

This is why I think that graduating early is a bad idea, because students will be very tired and stressed trying to catch up on school work. If you do four years of High School instead of three years, everything will go a lot slower than three years and also you will be less stressed, when it comes to catching up on school because you will have less classes to worry about. This is why it's better to do four years of High School.        ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,8.0

Helping other is a good way to provide them with a good attitude for their life. For example, I help my friends with homework or a study guide.

Electives can be helpful to students because it teaches them something new about the history of the different kinds of arts class and help them understand whats going on around the world and teach them how to play instruments and see where the origin is from and how it is played,art is teaches student s how to paint and make clay and shows who are most the famous painters,where they,d come from and how,d they became such great artists. drama shows who are the greatest actors,famous plays and how they became famous.

Students say that an elective is better than it be a required class because its like having free time but you get to do something that you dont get a chance to do and it could be a career in the future for someone who is interested in doing it and sometimes the counselor puts the students into an elective that dont like and its not a required class and if they dont like it they don,t have a choice but to stay in the elective .

Therefore students should be able to choose their own elective rather than it to be a required class that you need to pass in order advance into the next step of life and it will help them learn something in the future and remember what happened during their time in that they spent in that elective.

It's like you're dreaming about something you very enjoy doing on your spare time and just pinch yourself to see if it's true but sometimes it's not true. Just imagine about spending time with your friend's and family having so much fun all together hanging out in just one area, laughing. You can take a trip to a wonderful place with good vibes just like a fairy. Go shopping for new fits to wear when we go on the trip. Like a beautiful place with fresh tropical blue colored water with smell of a breeze looking all ready. Just a day of going swimming into a clear tropical ocean, then go out to eat some tasty juicy steak with your all your friends and your whole family I can't wait to have a day like that so I would like to visit...

Bahamas, it looks very peaceful,relaxing,pretty, and cozy on a couch watching Netflix. Bahamas can have some restaurants,pools,toys store, also places to buy some good clothing. Buy a bathing suit to go swimming. The water looks clear that you can see some sea animals/plants through the water like: dolphins,seahorse,jellyfish,fish,squid,seaweed,starfish, and other similar stuff that lives in the ocean. Not all of the sea animals/plants looks the same they have different looks. Some sea animals are quite friendly so you can swim with them and observe them but don't touch some they might think they're in danger.

If you can't swim I warn you not to swim it can be deep you can drown and they're might be sharks. If you wear goggles underwater it's going to look very cool depending if your goggles are in good condition. Seeing the sea animals/plants in person is even better, it's right in front of you.

Once I arrive to Bahamas am going to check out how my new hotel room looks like. There's going to be two hotel rooms, one medium for my family and a huge one for all my friend's. Am going to check the both of them out to see who look's more better. It's more different in the internet then seeing it in person how it actually looks like. I want it to have a good view like an ocean or a sunset outside my window or balcony. Am going to see if it's a good place to stay at. I want the room to look so glamorous and/or fancy. Im going to invite all my friend's so they can also have a fun time with me in Bahamas so they won't feel left out. All of my friends and family will go to a carnival then play some games all together. Once we arrive home we going outside to burn some marshmallows on a stick then eat the sticky sweetness when we going to drink some hot coco in the windy night.

Then am going to take a nice walk and play around on the white soft warm sand with my family and friend's outside near by the tropical ocean. Take some pictures on my phone and print then out from the printer to hang it up to remember the fun we had in Bahamas on the day we went. Before that we will out go to eat some delicious good tasting food with everyone who came to the trip with us. We would try out some new foods that we never tried before including drinks too. The new food can be some of our new favorite's just from trying it to see if we like it. We also can learn something interesting eating new food's can become your new favorites. It's going to be very exciting for me trying new food because, I like trying new stuff when I visit a new state or place around the entire world. They can have a mystery surprise like a filling or a different shade of color.

In retrospect, if I had to pick only one place to visit from the whole entire world it would be Bahamas because, you can enjoy your life with all of your closet friend's and your family. Bahamas can be mean't for trips if you like swimming and hanging out with close friend's and family.

If you do it now then later you dont have to do it because maybe later you have to do something else and it would keep adding up and it would take you more time to finish.

3F3DC123EDF6,"Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere in young people lives? Some people believe that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers while others believe that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. This is important because is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekday curfew for teenagers. This is going to help teenagers how to be responsible, get a job, and learn how to take care themselves.

First, teenagers have to learn how to be responsible because some teenagers do not grow up with their parents. For example, they have to go a school in the morning, and they have to go a work at night. This is important for teenagers who work and study hard. That is why is not fair that the city council debating the adoption of 10 P.M. for teenagers because they do not have some else to help them to pay bills or other stuff.

Additionally, most of the teenagers have a job at night because they want to go to the university. For example, teenagers only have time to have a job at night, and they help their parents to save money. Their is a lot of teenagers who really want to go to the university and universities are expensive. This is a big effort for teenagers that they really want to reach their own goal, and their parents do not have a lot of money to cover the bill of the university

However, not everyone agree with this position. Some people claim that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. Nevertheless, teenagers are going to learn how to take care themselves because their are not going to live with their family all the time. For example, some teenagers take the decision to move to other state or country. And it is a good idea for them how to take care themselves without parents.

Based on this argument, one must conclude that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers because this have to be an option for teenager to do what they really want to do. Some teenagers are responsible for they own self, this help them to be prepare for their own future, and be a teenager who can protect their self in a earlier age. This is gonna help teenager to maturity.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.5,8.0
1BAD681F72CB,"I think It will be enjoyable to couplet a science experiment because is an educational activity. You can have fun,you can work and meet with different persons,and you can learn more about the subject.

First of all I think It will be fun couplet a science experiment because I like sciences and I can learn more about experiment. Also I love going to my sciences class when we do experiments because It fun. I always laugh when I do experiment and they don't work. Another thing that I think sciences is fun is because you never know if the experiment will be work. One day me and my little cause we did smile in the kitchen and my mom gets mad and she make me clean the whole kitchen but, then we did smile in school and I already knew how to do it.

Secondly when you are doing a science experiment You always have to work in groups sometimes with your friend's sometimes not. For me its cool to work with different persons because when you do not know something and you ask them and they know they will help you and thats why for me is enjoyable to do sciences experiments because I'm a friendly person. One day in my sciences class we were doing an experiment then a new student came and the teacher ask me if I could help him and I said ''yes'' because he just knew Spanish and I help him and we became friend.

Then doing a sciences experiment it not just to have fun is to learn more about the subject that you are learning because is no the same doing the experiment then just listing to the teacher explaining. A lot of time this has happen to me that Im listing to the teacher but I don't understand nothing but when we do the experiment I do understand.

In conclusion for me completing a sciences experiment is one of the my favorite things because we don't just learn we have fun and thats why I like it. Also to complete a sciences experiment you do different things you don't just stay sit you move around. At the being of the year I did't speak to much English and it was hard to understand the teacher but when we start doing experiment it was more easy and now I understand more and that make me feel happy and that one of the reason I enjoy doing experiments.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,6.0

When the student is in home he going to do what he want he don't care the class he going to feel like if he don't have to do have to work in that class and he don't thing if he going to lost the class, one example is one of my friends he have a oline class but when he is in home he dont work because he dont care because no have one teacher who says ""Work or you no going to pass the class"" and thats one reason.

My second reason is when the student is taken online classes he just going to finish, he no going to learn because he dont care learn he just going to complete the leasons but just that, why? because he dont have the teacher who explaing when he have questions or when he is interesting in something of the class he no have the teacher who know more abaut that.

Some people says when the student take the online class from home he are more concentrade however whent the student take this classes from home he are more distractic because he have the cellphone in his hand or he have the TV in the room, the dog, the play station and he going to prefer play or see movies than work on the classes.

934BB35BE9F2,"I think working in a group is more beneficial than working alone because students can give each other feedback, ideas, and can also save up time.

It's helpful when students give feedback or ideas to one another when working on an assignment. If they all work together on an assignment it will turn out they way they all want it to look like. I like receiving feedback and helpful ideas because it helps me understand the certain assignment better. When I was working on a group assignment in my english class, I was assign to write a two body paragraph about summer vacation; Since, we all had 45 minutes to write, we decided to write our own ideas so we can gather all our ideas at the end. It was very helpful for me to receive some different ideas from othe classmates, it made me understand the prompt better.

Therefore by receiving feedbacks and ideas from other students, it can help with time consuming. For me it takes up at least 1 hour and 30 minutes to write about a prompt by myself. If I work with a group it usually takes up like 45 minutes. While working in a group it can help your assignment look better and it wouldn't take as much time as working alone. Students working together always saves up time for more ideas to its very helpful for any students that needs more help on an assignment. teachers often usually give you a certain time fro an assignment but there's no worry when working in a group.

However, some students may say working alone is more beneficial rather than working in a group. I disagree, students can all gather they're infromation to make an assignment better. Without the other students thoughts or ideas I would'nt get much ideas for myself to make my assignment look better. Teachers like students working independently most of the time, which is right, but students might actually learn better if they're in group so everyone can help one another. Feedback and ideas can make any ones paper look better and with everyones help, they can all agree without no rush in time. Therefore, its much simpler to working in a group so everyone can recieve feedback, ideas, and time.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,7.0

Although many of the teenagers are constantly restricted nevertheless, the teenagers more younger`s that 18 has their own`s responsibilities and obligations to themselves and for their families because, the teenager`s need education, a home and money.

The teenager`s need education, being from elementary until high school grades. In 5 or 10 years in the future the teenager been the support from the economy, the country and the next generation.

Guidance is taking advise and having other decide what one should do. while guidance can be helpful, it can also be misleading, and people aren't completely following their insticts when other decide for them. Being self-reliance is important due to the fact that if someone make their own decisions, they have the freedom to problems solve. Making mistakes enables one to learn and grow.

With the use of Self-reliance guidance from other human beings unneeded. Those who are self-reliant believe that other human are capable of doing the same tasks that they are. In nature, most animals have to be self-reliant in order to stay alive, for example, as a bear gets older, their parent has to, let them go off in the wild alone. Bears are able to maintain life by finding their own food and shelter.

With the use of guidance, humans and animals learn what works the best for them. Self guidance allows for mistakes to occur, be corrected, and allows for people to find their own solution. Even though not knowing anything or not being able to complete the tasks alone; it is a trait that allows individual to grow and better themselves by finding their own way.

Self-reliance is more than the choose and make one's own decisions. It requires integrity and the will to face up to the challenge that, ultimately betters one's character and work ethic. Solid solving capability leads to more creative.                            ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.0,9.0

Hello I hope you doing well, my name is Generic_Name. The present letter is to let you now that I'm fascinating of your business management, and I'll be glad to visit it. As you probably know many students are compelling to participate, indagate, and discover about distintic occupations in the work place. I think that it will be the most exiting thing that I could do because probably I can find an appropiated place of my interest to work at.

In fact, I can learn about the resposability and most of the times the presure that some workers have. The importance of follow the rules, every little thing in the work place it could be important for me in the future.

To adapt in differents positions and the most imporatnt thing is to love what I would do, to be an applicated, and apassionated person in the place that I would like.

Nevertheless, many people hate their work because they never had the chance to visit many different places that they wanted, couldn't achive their goal or may be the postion that they wanted was alredy taken by someone else.

The resposability at work has to be the most important, if a worker doesn't have the resposability in their job it will be a big problem, they might not care about the job and the things that their boss asked for.

I would like to be the person who has the responsability and all the interest of my job, and be proud of myself by doing the right things.

Althought, I can learn day by day how to impprove without an advice of the manager and be the best worker in my area.

Actually I think school should change to a new healthier menu, because it will help students a lot, like students will not get sick that often and students will be more concentrated and pay attention in classes. Imagine how many people have die because they don't change their nutrition. I saw in the news couples days ago,how a women died, because she was overweight; In order for her to have more time to live she had to change the way of how she was eating. The women never try to change her nutrition so saved her life, so she kept eating and she died because she had a heart attack. That's why I think school's should change to a new healthier menu and students will have a good nutrition.

People says that school's should not change their normal menu for a healthy menu, because students can get sick if school change the normal food to healthy food. The majority of students like fast food instead for healthy food and that's why students will not be agree with school changing to a new healthy menu. They are so many reason why students don't agree. One of them is that's students don't like to eat healthy or take care of their nutrition they just want to eat what they like.

However I think that all school's should change to a healthy menu because students will be more concentrated and they will pay more attention in their classes. The majority of students they do like to take care of their healthy, like the football guys they like to eat healthy and they need to be. Cheerleaders also like to eat healthy so they can have a good body so their uniform could fifth. Students with a great nutrition are most likely so not get sick that often than the students that don't take care of their health.

In addition another reason for what all school's should change the lunch time menu is because it help students with their health like their weigh and the normal development. In some cases doctors recommend to students to eat a lot of vegetables and fruit because it help them and have vitamin for thbeir body.

And when someone tries to change their first impressions they always fail. First impressions are the reasons why people don't get along because they think different about each other.

In my experience on first impressions are always bad, because when I'm going to talk to someone and the first thing I do before talking to them is judge them in good way. For example, if I'm going to a new school and I go my first day of classes, and I don't know no one in that school, and I want to talk to someone or be friends with someone, I'm going to have to talk to people in the new school, and before I talk to them I always think if they are good people or bad people. And if think that someone is bad, but in reality she/he is a really nice person. That is an example of first impressions.

Having the opportunity to learn in a way that is most comfortable for you, can really show improvements in grades. Students who are sick and are not able to attend school also have an advantage of doing missing work from home. This will give students no excuse for being behind with school work if their able to do classes from home.

Students that are often sick, or miss a lot of school because of personal reasons would have an advantage with doing their classes from home. If students have the opportunity to do classes from home they dont have to stress about returning to school, and having a lot of class work to make up. Therefore, students will no longer have an excuse for failing classes because of absences if they have the option to do it from home. When i had my surgery last school year it was nearly impossible for me to catch up on all my missing work, the only way i could do my class work was if someone picked it up from school. Unfortunately my parents both work so while i was out of school i had no way to do it from home. It was very difficult to finish all that work after getting back, because i was not given many options of getting the work done. If i was given the option to complete my class work from online this would have really helped me maintain my grades up.

Seniors might be in the position where they need more than the usual amount of classes to graduate by their final year. Having to be in such a difficult position and only being able to attend morning or night school can make it harder to get these classes done on time. This will only make it stressful, and discourage students to get the classes done by the time of graduation. Not only do some seniors have jobs after school but having to attend a full day of school, and either morning or night school can be tiring and overwhelming. Overdoing yourself can also decrease the amount of people that pass their classes because of the reason that they have to much to get done in a matter of one school year,so allowing students to do some classes online will make it easier for more students to graduate.

The idea of online classes might sound difficult for some students because they tend to learn better face to face. Schools can offer virtual teaching lessons for those who have an issue with attending all their classes at school and learn better by someone verbally explaining each concept to them. Not all students have computers at home which is understanding, in order for students to complete online classes from home they will need a computer,schools can offer students a borrowed computer or laptop in order for them to participate in online classes. Schools can Introduce a system where they provide for those who need the help of obtaining a computer and to still be able to do their classes from home. By providing for those who need the computers, students will not be held back from the idea of doing classes from home just because they dont own a computer.

Having the choice of doing classes from home can be very beneficial to students. This gives students the opportunity to complete more classes and actually do them without having the excuse of being absent to school. Given the chance of doing classes from home can increase the passing levels for more classes. The idea of doing classes from home can be helpful for students who need it, and encourage students who need the option of at home classes to actually get these classes done from home. I think all schools should have an option that allows students to do classes from home.        ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,8.0

AAAAA48F6FEB,"Students should not be allowed to graduate high school a year early, as this will cause students to only have a lack of free time and enjoyment of being in high school. They will have to give up their summer vacations, and even their evening time because of the courses they have to take. The students will miss out on taking electives, as well as missing out on valuable high school experience by being forced to grow up a year early.

With only doing three years in high school, it prevents teenagers from having free time. With the three years only, there is no free time for elective courses. All of the important classes have to fit in one tight schedule in order to maintain and pass all the requirements needed to graduate. I mean at least since you won't have electives you will have more time catching up on your mandatory classes. The lack of electives and and the three year plan, can cause stress and anxiety that prevents teenagers from achieving their full potential. Additionally, the students will lack the amount of volunteer hours and extracurriculars that other students will have through a regular graduation program. The lack of extra activities will prevent students from getting into good colleges, because they will be to focused on school to be able to do anything else.

Doing a three year program means you have to give up summer vacations and evening plans. You will have to take classes over the summer and at night. As a result their will be no more ""summer""

for the students. Instead they are working throughout the year trying to get everything they need done first in order to graduate and receive their credits. In order to get classes during the night time, students would have to find a way of transportation. The county will be paying also more money for teachers. Driving to school would result in students spending money on the increasing price of gas. Spending money would also extend to paying teachers for their extra teaching hours. High school in the three year program would result in spending lots of excess money and increase complications in students' lives.

Many students wish to pursue a three year high school program allowing them to graduate early. They want to do that because, they have a specific reason. Some students have families that need their children's ability to work, to help provide for the family. Therefore, a three year high school program appeals to the child so they may help support their family. Other families may need the childcare because they have younger siblings, and their parents work multiple jobs. However, a three year program leaves very little time to actually work during the program and can impact the overall success of the student. Many schools have work programs actually connected to the school, so that students can work while still maintaining their studies. However, a four year program is much better suited to the teenage mind, desires, and overall life.

A three year graduation program prevents a teenager from being able to enjoy their high school experience. By graduating a year earlier, their childhood years are taken away as they're thrown into adulthood earlier. Along with missing out on more childhood experience, they lose social aspects for their years. This includes friendships, being able to volunteering, as well as activities. The program can also take a toll on the student by piling on extra work as well as taking a toll on other people, such as teachers and parents. Overall you should always do your research before committing to the program in order to make sure it will be beneficial. ",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,10.0

My cousin take a decision of graduate in four years because she want experiment new things and learn more, she is a good student with a good grades but she decided be one more year in high school for learn more about you're career she select classes talk about you're career she is very smart because study and work for accomplish you're goals.

Who decided graduated in three years or four years is a good idea because each students think different, many students decided graduate in three years because think it is a good idea for they to finish high school for enter college one year early or for work more and saved money for acopmplish you're goals.

3C2AFBFEDA6B,"Although most people would want to graduate and enter college or the work force a year early,others may argue that school should be the four years. One should be allowed to grow up. It should be mandatory to do four years of high school and here is why.

First of all,school prepares students to face up and go against the real world,some students may need at least one more year in school to get their mind set for their future. Staying the extra year can make the student focus more on the classes that they're taking. If students decide to only go for three years, they can forget about sports or any after school activities they want be in. They will have to put all their effort and energy into passing their after school classes.

Second of all,students can be more independent. Students learn how to manage time to do work and extra activities. Students can also learn how to be more reliable and build up their confidence on doing things on task and on time. By doing the three year only, they cant take breaks and if so the students wont have enough time to rest their bodies and be able to do what is asked.

Some may argue,that students staying for three years are going to have enough knowledge to be able to take on the real world. However,students that have four years would have a more since of what they are going to do after the four years have passed. In conclusion,students should stay and have a better understanding of what is going to come up next.",4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,8.0
0F8F499BAAB9,"I think it is a good idea for students to select a career at a young age by the time they enter high school.

Because for example right now I am in high schools in eleven grade and I dont know what career I want to take it.

I agree with the societies that do students expected to identify a career, at that way they are gonna know what career they want, some students likes more than one career and they dont know which to decided before they graduated..

They are others students that the career that they want it is to expanses and they don't have enough money to pay they can try to get like a scholarship with having good grades and they have to stars in nine grade with good grades and they can apply for one later and see if they can get it.

I agree that the students select a career at a young age, at that way they are prepared and when they graduated of high schools that are gonna go to college ad choose a good career,

F9BE4676CA35,"""All students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.""why? well because it helps you a lot in the future or now so the principal is right on letting every student do an extracurricular activity.

To me each student actually should participate in one or more activity. Because it helps you mentally and emotionally,and helps you get collage credits and be healthy. Many research has proven many reason why people should do at least one activity to help you benefit in life .Research has proven people who have done sports most likely wont have heart attacks or won't even have breathing problems or mostly any issues.

How it helps you benefit in staying fit or healthy or both is well playing a sport can really help you lose weight .help you be more active like for example playing baseball,basketball,track or even being a cheerleader and many other sports can help you a lot more then you think, because research has proven a lot that people who are more active are people who are benefiting from it a lot .

Another way it helps you is emotionally is because you get distracted and you dont think about the stuff that is stressing you all the time. you know you have a break from what is keeping you stressed because you are having fun. for example of having a way to distract yourself isn't just sports its working with other like helping out the councilor, helping out in making the yearbook, helping around in the school and not being just about you when your just thinking all about you well that is the problem. Instead of have all the students separated you can put all of the students each in different groups everyday that way people get to know each other and have fun .

collage credits also matter and playing a sport or just helping around the school would look amazing on a collage application . Extra activities would make a lot more collages be interested in you and most likely be interested in giving you a scholarship. You mostly get into a great collage because all the extra credit actually helps you get noticed by a lot of collages because they aren't just looking for people who have good grades they are looking for people who actually are more outstanding. Like grades are great, but how can you handle being nice . Have certain thing taken care of before anything . well how you take certain things serious because if you can't take your own high school classes seriously how are you going to take care of your classes in collage .Also collages are seeing how independent you are, and how well you do around others .

Having all the students do one or more extracurricular activity will benefit them so much of a lot of reasons why actually so you should try it out .Also because it doesn't hurt you to give it a try . I agree fully with the principal because not everything is a lot what you want you have to just go with it .",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,6.0
CEC5B40D1688,"The technology that humans have developed is very advance; a lot of time has been dedicated to it, so society can have a better and easier way to access to technology. However, as all things that are crated by man are not perfect, and it has its positive and negative impacts on people. A lot of those impacts that technology have are negative impacts. For example, you loose the opportunity of interacting with other people, you can get addicted to technology, and you can get lazy, and all these negative impacts affect the new generation the most. The little kids end up playing video games their entire childhood; instead of playing outside, and making new friends.

First, technology it is not just to have fun with; you can play video games, but keep in mind that if you abuse of the use of technology you are going to get addicted in a very short period of time. Spending all your time in technology have its consequences. You loose the opportunity to be in contact with the people around you, you can loose your friends if you had any, and most important you can loose your communication that you once had with your parents. You can have hundreds of friends on social media, but it is not worth it if you do not spend time with them. Also one of the most negative impact is that little kids are getting addicted to technology. They are spending most of their childhood playing video games, and doing things that are not going to do any good for them in the future. They should be playing outside with their friends, and enjoying their childhood which is one of the most beautiful things they have. When you are a little kid you are so innocent that you do not have to worry about any problems the adults may have, and you do not have any problems to worry about either. Unfortunately that childhood have to end at some point because nothing last forever, but in the meantime you just have to live your childhood and not worry about any video games.

Second, you can use the internet for any need you may have, for there are hundreds of websites of anything you would like use. For example, shopping online, checking out book, and get any information you want. Some other websites are not quite useful like scams, or some websites that contains virus. At some point you may or may not run into a scam website which are used to obtain personal information that you have put online. They can get that credit card information that you used for your online shopping, your social security number, or even your own bank account number. There are people that work on trying to protect your personal information; they use their knowledge for the good of society, but there are also people who uses their skills and try to get your personal information, and use it for their own benefit. Keep in mind that those people can be smarter than you, and they can take every single dollar that you have in your bank account if you put your information at risk.

Third, you become lazier when you can get any information you want without making a big effort because you have everything at the reach of your hand by having access to the internet. You got so used to getting things fast and without making an effort, and when you have to wait to get any kind of information you get frustrated, for the fact that you have to go through a whole book, so you can that information. Man have been making your life easier by creating all the technological advances you have now. For example, you do not have to make an effort to wash your clothes, or wash the dishes you have been given all of that, so you have became lazier.

At the end technology can result positive impact to society; it has made our life easier, but it has resulted in a negative impact for the new generations. It has made the youth lazier than it was in the old times; teenagers are now addicted to social media, and we are loosing the communication with our parents which is very important to have. Little kids are loosing their childhood in result of the new technological advances that allows them to be playing video games and not going outside to make friends. Technology has put the security of our information at risk by no protecting it enough. Maybe it is the way we use technology, but it has more negative impact than positive impact to our communities around the world.                              ",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,8.0
14409A305AB3,"As a student, I can say there are a lot benefits for a student from being able to attend classes from home, is really convenience for a student that some schools offer distance learning as an option, every school should have that opportunity; it ca be helpful for a lot of students, is good for students that does not have a lot of time, so that help them to have a flexible manage of time, in some cases the student are more successful by taking the classes online.

For example if some students have to work , and because their work's schedule take them a lot of time or they have to work at night, they do not feel like waking up earlier in the morning, sometimes they start to getting late to classes, missing classes or missing all days of school, but if the student try to taking classes online can be really helpful for them; since they can have their schedule at their convenient, the opportunity or the facility of making up their on schedule according to their others activities.

Also when someone have to travel a lot for some reason, taking the classes online they do not have stay in the same place every time they are taking the classes, it dose not matter, they can take it anywhere they want, the only two things they need is a computer, and also to have internet connection, and thats it, they should be good with those two things or some people do not have that facility of moving of one place to other, they do not have the money to defray cost for the transportation, or is just to far away from their houses, so the classes online are a way to fix that problem.

There is a large percentage that the students that are taking or took classes online are or were going great, their are doing a successful work, they are being tempting to show more attention to their classes, a lot people say that they feel the classes easier, and also that is easier to study,

when the classes have videos they can put back the video over and over, when ever they want, how many times they want, where ever they want,if they want the teacher to do not talk fast or to do it they can regulate that also, they save a lot of money, because they do not have to spend a lot of money in materials, like for posters and things like that, they do not have to be with some people that distract them from the classes and is also faster to get the classes done.

So how is showed the opportunity that some schools bring them is wonderful, it have a lot of benefits for us, like some students are more successful taking the classes online, so much students are interested in the classes online, feel like is better for them so that way they can be taking classes and doing other things, they just have learn how to manage their time; people that work can do their classes at morning and go work at night, they can have a flexible schedule.",3.5,4.0,2.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,7.0

This is not a good benefit for students for three reasons; students can make some tricks for pass the classes from online or video conferencing, some students can have trouble doing the homeworks on online and the teachers will have more work to do for teaching the class on online. I believe if students being able to attend online classes from home, they can make some tricks only for pass the classes on online and they will not really learn anything of the classes. however, other people say this is a good benefit because is more easy for the students take and pass the classes. I think those people are wrong because take online classes is looks like easy but it's not, this would be difficut for many students. Furthermore, some students can have trouble doing the homeworks on online because the online classes can be unsuccessful since some computer issues or the computer ruin when the student is in the middle of the half hour of the online class. some people may be think students can not have this type of problems if they buy the high price of computer mark. I think they're wrong because it doesn't matter the price mark of the computers, some times the computer just ruin for some broken tools inside of the compuers or others electronic programs and the people doesn't know about it. In addition, teachers will have more work to do for teaching the class on online because the teachers have to find many ways about, how they can teach the class for the students understand really well. Teachers have to learn how to make homework, how to show informations that the students need to know and other things. Some people say the teachers already know how to work on the internet and the students will understand better the teacher, but this isn't true because the teachers some times have trouble too, they need to learn many programs for making successful work and the teachers are not 100% sure that students understand the class. In conclusion, students shouln't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they're smart for making tricks for pass the classes from online or video conferencing, some students can have trouble doing the homework on online and the teachers will have more work to do for teaching the class on online.

242632EC61DF,"In the world we live in today, some people like to work alone or even work as a group. Working as a group has benefits like finishing difficult tasks, brainstorming , less work, helps improve our communication , prepares us for a good performance as well. Others may like working alone because they like the feeling or just because but it doesn't have the same beneficial ideas as working as a group. Teamwork is always a good feeling and very helpful.

If some like to help each other out right, Why not work as a group then. It feels like to me its very helpful that I have a team around to help me. It's important if I don't know something, my team is their to help me out. If i am putting false information, that helps from my mistakes . By helping each other out, We can achieve the task we need to accomplish. Seeking for help is important. It's always good to help each other out one way or another.

Working in groups, finishes difficult tasks than people working alone. We use brainstorming skills as a team to gather more useful information. People that work independent may not have useful info as a group does. Working alone may not be helpful, specially when their is nobody around me because I would want to ask questions and all i would probably have is the internet and I do not trust the internet as much as i trust in my team.

By working with others gives me the opportunity to improve my productivity and helps us do well in our performance. I would be more active by working with others, asking my team questions or for their own opinions. By working alone, my productivity wouldn't be the same as working with others. Working in groups gives us the opportunity to have a good performance as well. We all want to fix the mistakes and learn, so towards the end we have a good performance. Working as a team creates less work for each individual, increases productivity.

Working in a group is better because new ideas are generated. Trading thoughts and ideas are important as well. Communicating with others helps us know what we are supposed to do and not do is important. As a team, we get things done faster. We gather facts from different point of view then that creates diversity, diversity is key of success as well.

Working alone may not be as much helpful. Studies say, people who work independently, get much more work. I mean their isn't many helpful sources around you except the internet which isn't very helpful as much as a team is. They have more responsibilities and more to worry about.

Overall I think working in groups is beneficial because it creates less work and allows to create work much faster. Working together demonstrates criticism from members in the group which produces our final product which is our performance and creates different point of views. If we treat each other like a team, motivation increases among with other motivation, so us students are able to communicate with one another. Even though most students don't agree with each other, working as a group is more beneficial than working alone.                       ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,7.0

The type of experience does change the first impression because of the type of of person you are. Everyone has different personality because one person could have a personality that is boring, shy or funny. All these personality define of the first impression that you show the people. the effort has a big statement of the type of first impression you give on people . is the most ethics way to show your professionalism.

The type of expressions you give to people. you could have experiences sometimes people judge by the way you look or based on what you do for example if you go to a job interview the boss would see your manners and your body language. because the boss would make sure are a good member for the job in a job they kook for people who can be nice with costumer and have good manners. Every experiences could be different for other people you may have graduate from high school and college it could tell the boss you have good experiences that you have witness in your life that your life that you live in.

your appearance means everything expression and experiences in the life you probably can be wearing dresses, pants and dressing nicely . people would always judge you and assume a lot of thing about you. having a great appearances has the could change the impression .

one time i was at the mall wearing a blue dress and people where starring at the asking them self why is this crazy girl wearing a dress at the mall. they were judge en me by my appearances with out know where i was coming from. Everywhere you do people will think you are this and that just because of the way you look not everyone is a bad person just because of their personality you should first get to know that person get along with them because the appearances are not always right.

I know that everyone is different but, we all have something in common. That we all admire someone and we get inspired by someone. So we try our best to be like them. Until we get it or we surrender. Did you know that there are more famous people then poor people in U.S?

People think the we choose our own traits because everyone is different. We all have different thoughts and traits. For example, I'm totally different to my mom she gets mad for nothing, always yelling for so reason. Am totally different am very shy and don't like to yell. Sometimes we learn until someone give us a lesson or something happened. For example, my mom stop being angry all the time until she got divorce with my dad, my mom is is totally different now, she stop been angry all the time and don't get mad for nothing.

Our traits are controlled by someone we admire and we try our best to be like them. For example, I admire my dad because he's never get angry since I came to U.S he never being mad at me. I have done some terrible things. For example, One day I was playing Fortnite on my PS4 and I get mad because I got kill and I got so mad that I punch my control I against the wall. The control didn't work no more and my dad was just watching me and he just said ''just relax'' he didn't got angry another dad will be I would be punished for destroying the controller.

We get inspired by influences because they are famous and good people. There's no one in the world who never think about been famous. For example, some people famous help poor people. So, people get inspired by their actions and because they are popular so they get a lot attention. People who are very fans of them. They want to do the same thing, so influences control people's action too and traits

In conclusion,some people think that we choose our character traits. it's not true because we are control by influences treats' and actions. Because, we want to be like them therefore; people would do anything for their celebrities. We get inspired by them because we want to be like them.

FF190BD8380B,"My grandma always said, "" Is ok to fail, the only thing that matters is to stand up and keep trying."" A decision is the act of deciding something, as a controversy or question, by reaching a conclusion or making a judgment. If people take their own decisions, they are going to benefit. People should take their own decisions because it is a right, people can learn for the consequences of their actions, and people have the ability to think by themselves.

Many argue that people should visit a guidance to take decisions because guidance may have more experiences solving problems. However, they are wrong because in the past people fight and die for rights, and now that everyone have the privilege to talk for themselves they are not going to let others to decide for them. Clearly, people do not need to visit a guidance in order to made a good decision.

Initially, citizens have the right to take their own decision. For instance, Generic_Name, who is a citizen of the United States, wants to get the divorce because he found his wife cheating on him. To specify, he went to the court to get the paperwork done for the divorce. To detail, he have the right and the privilege to get the divorce because it is human right; he do not need the help of any guidance to made this decision because is something too personal. One should observe that taking decisions is a right that everyone is able to reach.

Additionally, people can make mistakes, but they have the capacity to emend them. For example, Generic_Name, for peer pressure, take a wrong decision about using drugs. To add, she realize that what she did were a wrong decision, and she understood that is bad for her health and she staunch doing it. Clearly, society can make people do what they do not want, but is in one to say: no; and fix what they did wrong.

Last, but not less important, everyone have different ideas and points of views, and because of that people should make their own decisions. For instance, Generic_Name's parents teach him to differentiate between good and bad; that means that he is not going to be in troubles for a bad decisions. To illustrate, he do not need the help of others to make a good choice. Obviously, humans are unique and sometimes people do not going to agree with others, but that does not means that one is wrong and the other is right; people need to respect others decisions.

In summary, taking decisions is a privilege that ancestors gave us, people are going to made mistakes in order to success, and everyone is qualify to talk by themselves. These prove that citizens should not need to see a guidance in order to made decisions. People must respect others points of views and do not judge them for what they do.

CEE41F7526FA,"I have some reasons why I would disagree with the school board because I don't like the idea of staying more time in school. Either way it is not a good idea because the school would face alot of work with the time extended plus it's gonna be more work than ever with the school extending. And I have a lot of reasons why its a bad idea so I guess start the reading the paragraphs right now.

First extending the school day would get a lot of students mad at the school because they want to go home and do whatever they want. The students would have to stay longer in the school and some would be mad and some be happy about it. And students that are bulllies would have a bigger chance on picking on people during the extended time of school. The next day the school would most likely be getting emails from students and parents complaining about the extended school day. While other students and parents wont care and go to school like a normal day and al lot more.

Also the jobs in the school could change like the teachers job and other jobs in the school time would be extended. Some teachers would complain by the extended school day if there gonna do a extended day everyday they are gonna have to be payed more or else the school would die slowly because all teachers,staff and other jobs in the school would quit and go work somewhere else better and get paid more. If one teacher does quit their job because of the extended time he/she would most likely tell other people that the school is terrible then the school would barely get people to work there and in a couple years later probably the school would be abandoned for other people to explore to see the leftovers of the dead school.

Finally the school would change by alot than before it ever has in its couple years of existance. The school would have to face a lot of consequnces like a lot of students posting on the internet about how the school is trash,boring and now they want to go to a different school. And the teachers would complain about if they are going to teach more than ever they want to get bad even more money. And they would have to change the whole school time of the day,the bus time and the students classes time which would took a very long time to do. Either way other jobs in the school would be more difficult than ever for example janitors,staff and teachers.

Even though the school really does want to change original time to a extended time it's not the smartest idea in the world because theres gonna end up being consequnces to it and they are not going to be fun for anyone. Either way next thing you know the county that owns the school will just die because of the extended day. Because then who knows probably no one then later on wants to go the either school in the county anymore and would probably just moved out to go to a better school.

C84D7D9C5F1F,"The reason why people do so is because they want to see if they have been in the same place as the person asking for advice. In my opinion getting different options helps them even more because that way his or her different friends response may help them and he or she gathers up the importation that is given and they choose whether it's good advice or not. When i need advice i go to three friends and they each give me a different response (advice) and its hard to choose which you want to take, but once you put all three responses together then it gets easier for you and you make a good choice by it.

Having multiple responses the better because the more you know the better, but sometimes the best advice you can ever find is from a family member that older then you or at least 18 and up because what advice you're looking for maybe they know more and can tell u what their advice is other than your peers. Another reason why you should ask your parents is because they can have more experiences then you and your peers and knowing from them is better then your peers because your parents don't like lying to you very often, so they give you the truth on what they think. Other then your peers because you can be friends with someone who doesn't like you and can tell you a whole other different story and make you do a mistake you didn't want to do.

It's good getting advice from may different people because its like a certain way of helping you on what your problem is. You can get so many different responses by what certain topic you choose, either its getting into a relationship, a certain subject you have trouble on or its how you want to change into being better, etc. That's why its better having different responses because you have so many to choose from and you dont have to stress out on thinking of some on your own when you have plenty ideas from different people. Some advises can not be strong on how you want it to be but it can help you in like, thats why its good having friendships with so many different people because you have more answers to your question or better advice from some of them.

I think work in a group is more beneficial because you have more help and, you get different perspective's on how to get the work done.

Each of the member's in the group can work on different's assignment. For example, one member of the group can search for information and, other member can look for imagines or, videos.

Also, you can make new friends and, make group feel comfortable that way you can talk with and, share ideas that you all have. Sometime people don't feel comfortable in their groups and they have great ideas but, they don't share their ideas. I remember when I was in 7th grade, in my class of History my teacher she almost always tell us to work in group and, I always wanted to work with my friends, but she put me in different group and, I was quiet and, I remember this girl came to me, she asked me for my name and, she told everyone in the group my name and they all were nice and I stared to give them some ideas and, everyone was working in different's things and, at the end we made I great job.

The second reason why it can help someone make a better choice is because other's can give you a better idea. For example,other ideas can help you something on your project,work,or test. In the morning,Generic_Name and Generic_Name was doing there work and Generic_Name already finished his homework but Generic_Name didn't. So,Generic_Name gave her big ideas to finish you homework. This shows how even tho Generic_Name had ideas,when Generic_Name gave her big ideas then she could've understand better.

The third reason why it can help someone make a better choice is because people who had experience can give you ideas for your life. For example,your parent or people who has above age had went by stuff in there life. When Generic_Name was talking with his grandpa, he would always ask about what he did when he was his age. This shows how some choice that you take can help in your life.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,7.0
848E99DD9C45,"The future job i seek in the not so distant future, is being a racer. Since i was a little kid, I spend a lot of time with my older cousins, we would always have a blast and have a lot of fun. My cousins own racing cars, like Mustang Ford, or The challenger from Dodge. Both of this cars are phenomenally fast and have a lot of horse power to them. My cousin being the young teenagers they where, they would speed. Thats when i started to like racing and that feeling of going fast, i'm currently 17 so i have experience on driving a normal car but driving a car at a high top speed, i wont be able to do that because i got no experience.

I would like to work with formula 1 cars, these cars go fast and theres a lot you need to know before driving these machines. Im a person who wont easily give up no matter how card the situation might be, i will always try my best. Im a responsible person too, i take care of my stuff for school and work on a part time after school. When i have my days off i have to take care of my duties and chores, i get them done.

And lastly i'm an outgoing and straight up person like, I like to have fun and enjoy what i'm doing at any moment no matter what it is, because i like to see people having fun and a good time, but when i see something wrong or that i have something to say i get over with and get it out there for people to know.

Other reasons why i want too to be a professional racer is to be the first one of the family to get that dream come true. I want to work hard and have a lot of fun on this journey so it could come true. i want to bring good positive things to this company, and make it even better than i was before i wanna work as a team and get it done with. i want to learn everything about a formula 1 car, like how to drive it at very high speeds, how to fix it if something is wrong, absolutely everything.

1649A2246587,"Benefits of being home school.

Have you ever felt like you could not handle school?, well let me tell you that you have options, in here you are going to know the benefits of being home school. When I was younger school was a challenge for me; There was always conflicts at school and the environment was really a distraction, not good for me. Attending to school from hone have a lot of benefits. Students are going to be more focus in their studies and they are going to understand the meaning of responsibility.

One of the reason why home school it's good for students is going to be that students are going to be more concentrate and focus on their studies. Students manage to work better if they are alone, since they do not have any distraction around them like: drama, bad influences, mean teachers, stress and so much more. This is really good for those students who want to get their stuff done and learn more efficiency. So attending to school from home is one good option for those who want to focus on their studies.

Responsibility is one of the most important skill that us like humans have to have. Being responsible is a hard skill to follow but it is the most important one since we use it on the daily bases. If students attend to be on home school they have to learn that is not easy and they have to be really responsible because they are not going to have a physical teacher in front telling them what to do. Therefore you have to get it by their on hands and learn the meaning of being a mature and a responsible person. Students are going to be more responsible because if thy have any project, homework or test they are going to manage the way to study and do their stuff by them self and using the tools of their online program.

I understand that some people may disagree and prefer students to go to a normal school since they are going to have more social life. Having social life it's really important but who said that being in home school means that they are not going to have any social life, it's the opposite because if students are all caught up with their things they are going to have so much time to hang out with friends and family.

In conclusion the benefits of being home school are really good since students are going to focus on their own things and studies also they are going to learn how important it's to be responsible. now days we use technology for everything because it let us have a lot of more options if people is struggling with school. so more schools should include some online programs for students who want to continue their studies from home. This is going to bring a big change in our community and more professional, responsible people. ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,8.0

For example if there's a project to be due, then that project must be due, and if the teacher gives you a due date it would be more motivating to finish it on time then later or even late. As long as the person doesn't give up and keep focus, then there's nothing to worry about. Staying on task isn't that hard, but if there's any distractions you must remove yourself from that situation and get back on track. Like imagine if a student was in class having trouble focusing because the students around them we're distracting or noisy. Then they may ask the teacher that they prefer working in the hall because the noise in the class is to distracting to them. The key is when it comes to doing something you must keep busy to reach that goal of finishing or being done. There are going to be some challenges, but you just need to overcome those challenges and learn from it its all about learning and progressing as you keep working towards it.

When people want an advice they ask more than 1 person because they want to hear different advice to make sure they don't make mistakes, and they want to hear the right an advice.

I think people should ask for an advice to more than one person, because maybe the first person that they ask for an advice were wrong. For example, when I need an advice I always ask my parents first. I always ask both of them, but sometimes they always have different opinions, parents always have the right advice for you, but the problem is the sometimes they both give you a different advice. Sometimes they told you an advice that you might not like, or the one that you weren't not looking for, and thats when I ask other people about advice like my teachers, friends, brothers, cousins, principals. just to hear what you wanted to hear or the right decision.

Without a doubt, I would ask more than one person for and advice, to hear about others people situations. clearly, I would ask multiple people an advice because you never know who's wrong or who's right, but atleast people give you different opinios, so they're giving you ideas about what you can't or can do. On the other hand if you ask only one person for an advice that person might be wrong, and you might to a wrong decison.

People should listen to all the advice that people give to them. I always listen to all the advice even if they're wrong i just need to make sure not to make the wrong decision. Sometimes I make mistakes by not listen to the right people.

People ask more than one person because when the first person that you ask and they told you something different, what you really wanted to hear. For example, I personally like to ask my parents for an advice first, but sometimes I don't like what they say to me, so thats when I ask other people like my friends, sometimes you think your friends are right not your parents. But let me tell you something parents are always right it doesn't matter if you don' like them or whatever but they're always right they will never will give you the wrong advice.

I can make the right or wrong decisions because i'm a human and everone had make wrong decision in their life. But sometimes people give you the wrong decision. When I ask for an advice to multiple people, you have to make the right decison. Those people might be right or wrong.

American jazz legend Duke Ellington said ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"".

Duke Ellington, he try to said when the people have a problem anyone have the chance to do something different and change the things.

I am agree with Duke Ellington, because when we have a problem or we do a mistake, we have an another opportunity to make something better and change everything.

I have an experience, the last weekend me and my friends has a project in a competition, we make a machine about binary numbers, we lose the competition and I knew we do many mistakes but this Saturday we need to go to the liberty high school to do an exposition about the same project, so we have an another chance to repair the mistakes and do the best.

But if they try to repair the problem before the problem get more bigger, they have the chance to the problem change to a good things or the things makes more better then before the problem.

9735E542665C,"Imagine having less day of school, students would be happy and could make their education simple. Some films have alredy adopted a four day work week, but they will work ten hours a day. Should school do the same thing by extending the school day and have four days of school? I believe that extending the school day and having four day of school could affect students by; getting them tired and they coud no longer in school.

To begin with, it has been said that students are tired in school because they have seven hours of school everyday . Imagine giving them nine hours of school, they could get tired quick and have stress. To illustrate, a student woke up at 6:30am to prepare to go to school, he will start the school at 8:00am and he will be finish at 5:00pm. After school the student will got home tired, he will jus eat dinner and go sleep. As you can see,

students could not have time to play and do their homework. If school extend the school day, students could be just tired all the time. in conclusion, students are not slaves, they need time to play and do their homework.

In addition, extending the school day for students and have four days of school for them, this could make them not going to school. Another example, imagine a high school student have to finish school at 5:00pm knowing kids nowadays they don't like school that much. This could be an obstacle for this high school student and he will decided to not going to school anymore because he will feel a long day of school. As you can see, students could be absent in school if they extend the school day, and this could be a big probem for the community and for the country.

Yet some people argue that extending the school day and having four day of school, could make the students more intelligent. It is tue that giving extended time to students and give them only four days of school, could make them smarter. But they will not longer like school because they will feel tired and they will not going to school anymore. And this could be a huge problem for students and schools

In conclusion, schools should not allow to have four days of school and extending two hours more because this could affect students by; getting them tired and they could not longer in school. Let's make students feel comfortable in school, but not make them feel slaves. Students needs time with friends and family. ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,6.0

Schools are now moving with the technology age and allowing what was not allowed a few years ago. Some schools have cellphone usage for education purposes in classrooms. Today we have technogoly that can help succed in today's day and age.

I think we shoould have cellphone use in classrooms for education purposes. Students have their phones with them all the time it would better if we put to good use and play review games on our phones to help them unbderstand the work better. Students today don't want to fill in a study guide they would rather be with their friends, family, or on their phones. If they are on their phones it would be like game and they would actually do it because they can use their phones. The cellphone useage for educational purpose has become a thing of new ways to help understand what's going on when they're not understanding.

If a students misses class the teacher can send them the work that they missed to their phones or laptops. Students miss school so they miss the lesson plan and are behind in class. But their teacher can send them whatever is that they missed on that day so can be caught up with their class. Cellphones have grown over time and students can do they do all their work on a small screen. No matter if the student misses class they will not miss the work.

Some may dissagree to having cellphones in their classrooms because they can be a distraction. Other teachers don't like the idea of their students always being on their phones and not paying attention to the lesson. If a student doing a review game chances are that they will go on social media and not do what's told of the lesson plan. If a student is out and the teacher sends something to the students phone they may not get it due to losss of signal. Other dissagree of cellphones in the classrooms and some teachers agree.

In conclusion I think we should use cellphones in class for education purposes. The phones will help students understand the work. Teachers can worlk faster if evryone has their phone so they can move on quicker and do what is told of them. With the examples I have givin I belive that cellphone useage in class is a good idea.

Some events could happen at your community parks like, fundraising events, fairs, or you could have a birthday party, or a picnic at the park with your family or friends.

Therefore anoher enjoyable activity I like to do is to go fishing. Fishing does not take skill but it does take patience. Because once you put your bait is in the water your not going to instantly going to catch a fish. There mite not even be fish in the pond, lake, or sea you are fishing in. If you do not like to be out at sea or you get sick on a boat, you could fish at a dock. Docks are where the boats park there is mostly not going to be fish there because the boats make to much movement and noice that scare the fish away. Fishing is another enjoyable thing I like to do outdoors.

Another fun activity to do outdoors is to have a cookout or a party. Parties outdoors during the summer are fun because you play games or a sport competition. My favorite thing to do when we have a party or a cookout is to play soccer with my friends and go walk around town.

I hard that you are planning to Chang the school cafeteria food to a new, healthier school lunch menu, I think it's a good idea it's going to make a big change to the students. Healthier food will make student stay in shape and they are going to grow healthy.

To begin with, I think the cafeteria should change the school food to a healthier menu, because healthier food will make student stay in shape and they are to be strong. Unfortunately some students will not be happy about it, but this decision is becasuse it's of their own health. By eating health food will give us more energy to do school work and particapt in class activates, which is ging to help less sleeping in class. The cafeteria menu right now contents to much sugar, and too much sugar is not good for our body it can led to diabetes. Moreover students have bean compiling about the school food. Some students are saying, they are taried of eating the same food over and over. So by bringing the healthier food to the cafeteria will be more better and no more compiling.

Secondly, I know some other students will say, I have the right to eat what ever I want to eat. That's hundred peasant correct, but healthier food will make us grow faster, stronger, and healthier, while unhealthier food will make us get vover weight and lazy. Healthier food will make us not be over weight. Healthier food is going to be more helpful to students who play sports for the school. It's going to make them energetic and make them stay in shape. It also going to get them ready for practices and games. For the students who don't play sports can still eat health food, because it going to be helpful for their body.

0BDB87C86FE3,"Would you rather make your own decisions and follow your own instincts and ideas or would you rather get guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matter? I think I would want to get guidance from experts and authorities because it can give you different choices and opinions, can lead you to do the right thing, they know a lot more than you, and they make more experience than you.

Getting different choices and different opinions from experts are really important because if you were to make decisions by yourself than you wouldn't know their opinions. When you're trying to do something big you want to be able to hear everyone's opinions on it. You want to hear their opinions because later on you might regret making that decision and thought to yourself ""why did I do this?"". Ask for someone's opinions like your mom for their opinion.

Getting guidance can also lead you to go to the right direction because the experts would know a lot more than you because they are older and they are more experienced. They would tell you everything they been through and the truth because they would't want you to go through the same thing because they know how it fells to go down the wrong path.

They would also have more experience and more knowledge about it. The people who make decisions by them selves are later gonna regret doing what they did because they didn't get any advice from anyone who had more experience or who know a lot about life's matter. So before you make a big decision make sure to ask a elder or a someone who knows a lot about what your trying to do.

In conclusion I think seeking guidance from experts, authorities and elder are they best ways to get advice before they have a lot of experience or what they are talking about and they will give you they best possible advice they can, so later you don't regret the decision you made.

84618D2B60E8,"I honestly don't know what to right about really but let's do this, I like many things. My favorite things are my room, phone and my console. You wondering why I like these things I'll tell you why. The reason why I like those things so much, because that's my entertainment whenever I get bored. I'm always home doing nothing in my room and I realized that but theirs really nothing to do in Generic_City and I don't like Generic_City in my opinion. Everything is so far apart, you need to walk for an hour to go somewhere if you're walking but in a car is no problem you can drive and not be tired. The point i'm saying is I have a boring life and I have depression at some points. I also just never try ever since I got here. I've been miserable in everyway, not wanting to go to school, not trying in classes and not talking to anyone. I barely even have friends they all left behind back at home.

I also work here that's the only good thing I've done since I came here. I work at McDonald's by route 1. They pay at least 9 dollars an hour which isn't bad. I get along with my co workers, once a while theirs fights but everyone gets along with each other pretty well but sometimes that's also a struggle. They will be some customers just arguing with you or just mean because they want to be really. The managers they sometimes annoy me, want me to get everything and do everything since I know everything pretty good but everything in life is hard and you have to work for it. Nothing isn't easy I wish it was but it isn't, I make it hard on myself by not trying. I legit regret how my life is going so far. I know this is an SOL really but this is the only way to show any feelings or stuff I have on mind. Everything i'm typying so far is off my mind right now.

I wanted to become a professional soccer play but it got ruined. I used to do travel when I was back at Generic_City but ever since I moved I had to stop because my mom wouldn't take me because it was far. My practices will be at Generic_City 7:30 PM and they end at 9:00 PM, I just started slowly losing my way to play soccer because I didn't play at all. It was a struggle really for me because I lost everything but I know the reader that's gonna grade this is gonna be saying ""oh it happens, you just need to learn how to be comfortable with the place you're right now"" but it isn't that easy. I lived in Generic_City my whole and got raise there, went to school there, started playing soccer there when I was little and met new people I still talk to them til this day. I know I have talked about this in my last writing SOL but hey i'm here talking about it again because I miss everything I had and that's the only thing I have in my mind. Until this day I haven't been able to feel comfortable in place where I am now, I don't think I ever will be to be honest with you.

I really don't have a positive attitude, I try to be really bc I used to be a happy kid but now i'm really not. I miss the only motivitvation to wake up and try in life but It's gone and it will always be until I move out from my mom's house. I also never really gotten along with my mom since we moved because I was overall upset like the schools here are just bad and I don't like how they're it isn't the same back in Generic_City. I told my mom that specifically ""I don't like it here and I never will"" but she doesn't care. She thinks I'm over dramatc that I will like it soon. 2 years have gone by and I still haven't gotten used to it. I honestly don't even think i'm gonna graduate either bc of the school I am right now but I know it's on me. I will have to pass the classes I am right now, go to summer school and finish the last classes during summer school then I will be able to graduate. That's a lot in my opinion. I have 7 classes that I need to pass and right now i'm failing half of them. Already bad start to the new year of High School. I still have time to change it around but just the motivation is just not there.

The only thing that keeps me going and still kinda trying is my Girlfriend Generic_Name or Generic_Name as a short name. I've known her for 2 years now and I met at her Generic_City just before I left. She goes to Generic_School and during that time I met her I was going to Generic_School. I truly love her in everyway but sometimes she can be hard headed but it's fine I love her and I will always. She will sometimes come to my house and visit me whenever we have have time to see each other. I text her 24/7 every single day until we need to sleep but overall she's been there and I appreciate it a lot. So has other people but not as much as she did. She will help me every time I needed help on anything i'm struggling, she is really smart. I hope I can have her for a long time. I hope eventually theirs some hope honestly. It will come whenever it's right, just not right now at the moment.",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,7.0
A0B2BF94231C,"First impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for less than 6 seconds you think you know that person. Until you have a coversation with that person at least for ten mintutes. Your impression will change. However i disagree that first impressions is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks,personality, and their communication skills are always that change your whole point of view of that person. From your first impression, when you look at them.

However the way a person looks from your first impression isnt always who they really are. Your observation on someone aren't truely who they are. The person can be good looking person you've ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they are the wost person, that you hate so much. This also works the other way around too, the person could be the ugliest person you have ever met, but you never gave them a chance. Thats when you realize that, that person is really good. Its also like dont judge a book by its cover. Until you actually meet that person and get to know them.

Personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly who you are finding out, who that person is, can be life changing. For you not knowing who someone is can have a big change for you. You really dont know who you are really meeting. Personality gives great insights in that person and who they really are. Also however they want to come out to you.

Also communication is key its really important to have communication. Communication gives confidence to the other person who you are communicating with. That shows that you understand the other person and feel comfortable with them. Having good eye contact and hearing all the information of the conversation that they are giving you, makes them open more up to you.

Additionally, i disagree that the first impression is almost impossible to change. Their personality, the way they look, and communication skills can always change your whole point of view on a person. Looks can be looks, personality being honest no matter what. Communication skills are you by listening, can help you on your first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours , and effort to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging a book by its cover. First impressions can change ,by getting to know that person and who they really are.             ",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,8.0

Well what if you said no it looks ugly for you then, the girl will be hurt and would think that her mom lied to her and will start crying.

A72FE8731B45,"Ever since i started school i never liked the school lunch, i would always go the whole day without eating and I would'nt take a snack or anything so it could sustain in my stomach. Most kids at my school dont like the school lunch either, because they either think it tast wierd or just they are just picky about what they eat. Normally, when I would go almost a whole day with out eating my head would hurt or stomach and i know most teenagers in my school can relate also because they prefer to starve and not eat the food that the school serves. In my opinion. I believe that changing the schools lunch menu and making it healthier is a good idea because kids would enjoy the food, parents would not conplain about their kids not eating in schhol, and it would be a great advantage to improve the school lunch.

Most kids think that the school lunch is not very appetizing, but if the school cafeteria decides to change the school menu it would make a huge difference beacuse I know that most kids especially teenagers are very picky about their food or that it's disgusting. When I was younger I would'nt eat at school and until this day I don't because i didnt like and i would always have somach aches, and my head would hurt a lot, and i wasent able to concentrate in class. Most kids think that its not neccesary for the school cafeteria to change the menu but in reality most kids don't eat at school due the type of food they serve. Sometimes even the parents say something to their kids because they dont eat in school.

When i would go to middle school and the beginning of high school my parents would always wonder why I woud'nt eat at school, they got to a point where they thought i was depressed and i would always get yelled at because they thought something was wrong with me when in reality i just didnt like the school lunch. I understand why most kids dont like the school food because either it doesnt have flavor or it just doesnt taste the same as before, and also sometimes the food would make me feel sick from the stomach afterwards. Parents main concern is if their kids eat or not. I believe that by changing the menu it would would much better for parents to stop worrying about why their kids about why they dont like to eat at school. My parents especially my mom would barely have time to make me something, for example, she didnt have time to make me a snack or something real quick so I could have taken it to school when I was in elementary school, she would always tell me that she did'nt have time that she was always in a rush and thats why sometimes I would'nt eat. My mom almost went to put complain about the school food and that she wondered if I was the only one that would'nt eat in school.

I believe that if the school cafeteria has a advantage to change the school cafeteria food because they should think about why parents worry about their kids not eating and also parents putting complaint of why their chidfren don't eat at school. In my honest opinion i think that they should shange the menu because when I dont well or i dont eat at all it is hard for me to concentrate in class and that is a huge priority to pay attention in class and try to get good grades. If the school cafeteria plans to change the cafeteria food it would be really great because more kids will be able to concentrate. When i was in freshman an sophmore year I would always skip to go eat because I coud'nt eat the school food, i think that kids nowadays do the same thing just so they wont starve.

In my honest opinion i belive that changing the school food would be a great idea because most kids dont concentrate in class, parents worry about their kids, and also they it would make a great impact on the schhol.           ",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,7.0
FBE8983EF69C,"Have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity at school, Did you enjoy it? In today's day and age there are tons of extracurricular activities and even maybe some you never heard about. Its always nice to give something a try even if you have never done it before. You could even join something that you have already done before and that your good at. For example, if you are good at basketball you could join the basketball club and have fun doing what you like. I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends.

My first reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they gain new experiences. Its always nice to try something that you've never done before. For example, lets say you have no experience in cooking and theres a cooking club you can join. By joining that club you could learn about different foods and how to cook them. Those cooking skills that you learned could take you a long way or help you with something simple like cooking you or somebody else some food at home. Another example could be joining a club that has to do with the wild and things like nature. You could learn about things like how to make a fire or what plants are dangerous and which are not. There could even be some hands on experiences like fields trips to go camping or just explore the wilderness. These could help you if you ever wanted to go camping on your own later on in the future. These are just some of the things you would get to experience joining new clubs,there are so many more.

My second reason that students should join extracurricular activities is that it could help with their health. If students join a club they will be surrounded by other students and this will help them stay socially active. Instead of being at home in a dark room playing video game or on their phones, they could be talking other students and enjoying the activities in the club. Its always nice to have people surrounding so that way your not alone. Being alone could lead to things like depression or social anxiety and no student should have to go through any of those things. Another way it could help with their health is by joining a sports club. By joining any sports club students will be getting at least forty minutes to a hour of daily exercise. This exercise that the students are getting could help them with things like weight loss or just trying to stay in shape. Its always good to try and maintain good health and these are some great ways to do it.

My third and final reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they can make new friends. By joining these extracurricular activities students may meet other students they have never seen before. This could be a opportunity for them to be able to make new friends. On top of that, they could most likely have the same interests as they chose the same club or activity. For example if they joined soccer they may have a interest in soccer and they could build off of that. Once they become friends they could do things like help each other in school or maybe even hang out. They could even introduce each other to other friends that they have. For example, One student could ask the friend he made in the Art club if he wanted to sit with him during lunch and now that the student has been introduced and they can all be friends now. Making friends is always a good and fun thing to do.

Overall, extracurricular activities are a good thing for students. Whether its if your making friends, helping out your health, or even learning new experiences. Extracurricular activites are a big help to students. They should be encouraged to join and try them. I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends.",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,9.0

6E60D098D3AA,"Due to the fact that teachers give students many projects throughout the year and is based on teachers perspective this summer project will give students a chance to see what they have learned throughout the year. Students should be able to choose their own summer projects.

One reason why students should choose their summer project is because, their ideas of this project will be based on the students knowledge. Students will have a better understanding coming from their point of view also their project will show that they have understood the lesson and the criteria for this project. For example, teachers will give students a grade based on the students effort and understanding. If teachers give students the same project,

students will be tempted to copy from another student and won't deserve that grade. Students can gain higher level skills for not just for school but also for life. This is a great way to show teachers that the level of improvement that students have shown when choosing their own projects.

Students believe that teachers choose projects throughout the school year and this is their time to show what have they learned throughout the year. For instance, if students struggle with the teacher project and don't understand what the project is trying to refer students won't put as much effort in the project as if it was their own project. However, it has been said that students have a better chance in doing better when they but their mind to it. I as a student, believe that I do much better when I choose my own projects. Also us students don't get many opportunity to chose our own project during the year.

Students will have a variety of projects to chose from. Students have the summer which gives them a better opportunity to think of ideas. Students can pick a topic that their most confident in doing.

Some might say, that teacher have a better understanding then students. There are many pros and cons to teacher choosing the summer assignment. For example, teacher might have a summer project that helps the students understand more about what they have learned throughout the school year. From what I have experienced students succeed more when they choose their own projects.

In conclusion , It has been shown that students understand more from their own point of view than teacher point of view. Therefore, Students should be able to choose their summer projects.",3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0
F4B3B2CAB030,"I belief in this issue about the students are responsible with their class is favorable for them, take a class at home . Also Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by way online or video conferencing. I think is good idea, students would benefits from being able to attend class from home.

Some students take class in home because they do not have time to go to the school. For example, this e students need to take class from online because they work at night or at day . Clearly, they do not have time to go the school because they time is short and they need to organize their day for take a class so, some students take a class from online because their have many reason . In summary, some students need time for study , and they need this position from online for study and they can finish their class.

To day in the world exist many disease, and we need to get precautions with this dangerous disease. So for this problem some students can't go to the school for this big problem. Relating, this problem with school because the students health is so important. For example, the corona virus is so dangerous, students need a protection, because this illness inflict many death. Is so easy to get sick. For this reason, 
is important to students to get class from online or video conferencing,

is better study at home and also a good place, is the best way for students not get sick from this dangerous disease. However, this disease not have medication, but students we cant to prevent get to sick also, studying at home. In summary, is important to caring students they are the future for the world. For this reason some school need to get dis option, learning from online or video conferencing.

In another hand , i think is good idea, students would benefits from being able to attend class from home, and other people belief, this not a good idea , students would benefits from being able to attend class from home for this issue, students not leaning in one video conference but, some students don't want to go to the school because they have more than 17 years old or they can't enter to school for their age. Because, for you can enter to school minimal you need to have 15 to 17. Also, you have 18 you can't not to enter at school and is a problem because you can't find a good work if you dont have a graduation certificate from school. For example, some students want to study , but they can't because they can't enter to school for their age, I think is so important to exist a program when the people older the age can study line or video conferencing. However, many people need to get a certification but they can't for this problem, also the best solution is studying online is more accessible for them. They can have more opportunities in their life , they can get a better job. For instance students can learning online , is a big benefit for this students was can't enter at school. In definition everybody need a opportunity for study, for get a certificate from school. obviously the students are responsible with their class at home.

The benefit was school online or video conference represent is the student get more concentration at home , they do not have distraction for any other students, they do not suffer by bulling and they can get a good grade studying a lone in home. For example, sometime students get bad grade for this reason , distraction , they can't sleep at night also, they need to wake up to early for this reason they sleep in class,and they not put attention because they are tired. Also, the students have the opportunity to studying online they can organize their time and pass their class easy because they are focus with their class online also they not have distraction and its for that reason they get a good grades, students need class online or video conferencing , this program help many studying or many young girl are pregnant. Some young girl want to finish her high school but she can't because her are pregnant. However, some school get a program studying online is to much better for this students are pregnant is more easy, to studying at home because she can eating when she hungry and carrying her health for her baby. The program studying online is important to exist help to many students with different problems situations or health problems. In summary learning as action for students who wants to study online or video conferencing. I think is a good program for many students who want to study. Clearly,

everybody has the opportunity to study obviously the students who get study online has a responsible to attend every day their class and get their certification high school.

In conclusion, class online or video conferencing have many option to study, just is question of time for the students , they need to organize time for study online and can graduate , this program no have many different then the school just, the student need to stay alone and the benefit of that is you can concentrate better alone by your self. Also is better studying at home for this many disease dangerous is more comfortable state at home. However students no need age for study, what they need is inspiration and intelligent for study not need age.

A0D47C0DD67F,"Individuality is the idea of freedom of thoughs, but why we are concerned what other people think? Let's be honest everybody had copied at least one time in a test or quiz just because it was more eassy to coppy than being trying to remember the anwer that obviously you did not know. We own our thoughs, thus, we should do ours ideas not somebody else's ideas

In the book called ""Maria Magdalena"" based in the movie ""The Davinci code"" states the ideas of one individual who thalk about the true behind the story about Maria Magdalena ( Jesus' mother). To catholic people Jesus's mother is saintly. Their sanctuary, the church. To the author of the book ""Maria Magdalena"" she is just a lie's layer. On those old times there were many poor people who were opressing by the church, they sufer in the church's hands. The church killed to protect the true behind Maria Magdalena. On those times existed the crusades in spanish the ""cruzadas"" in which the church fought the protestants to convert them in their cristianity if they negated to accept it they killed them. The victims decide to follow their own beliefs and the consequence was the death. This is a good example of individuality similar to our way to live in the present. The politics want us to do what they want to their advantages opressing our rights just like the church did with the protestants during the crusades. The author of ""Maria Magdalena was very brave to wrote about those things. He was very successful because nobody used to talk about this, now they do. In this book he shared us a little part of what was to be different from the others and take their own decitions. Based on this I state that we can share our ideas of individuality and do not let our corrups politics to opress people's rights.

In the present we have a huge amount of successful guys because of individuality. The influential ideas of the past are not in our day to day anymore. Parents now teach their offspring to take their own decitions knowing the consequences of this. Now we, the tenageers, are more prepared to develop our ideas and beliefs. Constantly, my mom develop the ideas of individuality in our family. One year ago I decided to start to work, and I am very proud of my decittion.

I remember my first day of kinder garden, All the kids playing and runnig around the field. To be honest, I prefer being painting rather than be runnig for no reason. My art's teacher gave us draws made by her.""Ready to paint"" she used to say, but I was so rebel that I made my own draws just because I though her draws were so bored. I was a little girl taking individuality decitions and I did not know it

In my conclusion I am agree with individuality, If we want to spread the individuality, then we should start saying what we think, because the bravery of the unexpected ones, will persuade the shyness ones. Individuality can be hard but not impossible. We live in a world with influencers that try to persuade us to be like them. Do not choose the easy way. I prefer the hard way, so then I would be proud of my achievement just like Ralph waldo Emerson said: ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisment""",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.0

Every body ha heard someone in their life say "" two minds are better than one"" before right, this quote has never range more, and all of the idea it promotes reflect crystal clear off of group work. Working in a group can be drastically reduce the amount of work you need to do as well as make thing of more efferent, whether it be a group project paperer presentation. Because it cuts down on how much work one person has to do. It allows for group to achieve more as alone. Things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group an people with different skill sets can do what they are best at and do not have to worry about what they are bad at, this broader range of skill can also be used to help other people members develop their own by learning from their team members. The diversity found within a group of people is one of most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task.

it lends a group of people to have many more ideas to come up with and bounce off of because many people are working

""The best way to have good idea is to have a lot of the a quote from Linus Pauting dealing with dilemma new idea's. When dealing with abdicating an idea from thin air, it be best to have multiple people instant of one because it brings multiple ideas all have fair and different point rather than multiple ideas no opposition or diversity.

Another benefit of having multiple people working in one group is that this can cause an evolutionary like phenomenon with multiple, stronger idea that complete and mulute, creating one in tribute and exceptional idea. This also comes with the help of a group, as a group can decide which idea would be main idea and smoothe out the edyes.

Another problem that can come up is well problem. Having a group of people can become extremely helpful for solving a problem that may come up in situations where a problem can arise, having a group of people can allow for quick and easy way to get out of a situation. Now working in a group does not have its advantage but some things are best done alone

Though working in a group can seem to be good working alone can be better depending on the situation. Being in group full of adult and unfocused group members is infuriating and may seem like torture. Although, some people prefer working alone because they can focus better and make decision faster, in the end, it is a better to working in a group.

if one does not do work the only they fail. Also being in a group fell safe. While being alone means you are much more impotent so working in group

Though working alone can be better for one reason such as anxiety. paranoia worry about other preference, or simply because they would prefer to work alone. Working in a team is advantage over some others who are unaccustomed to doing so , it helps develop people skill decision making skills and general expertise for putting up with others.

working in a group is also good for getting other people's opinion on group member work, as long as they do their part, oftentimes students will learn and experience more in a group of their peers than working alone which is definitely better for their future an possibly what lies ahead. Developing these skill will most likely help in the coming times of college, careers their future family and even retirement.

Overall, working together is beneficial because it creates less work and allow work to be completed faster. Working together promotes constructive criticism from other member of the group , which produces a better final product, working together create different points of view with different points of view new ideas are generated. New idea create diversity is the way to success.",3.0,3.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,6.0
5C764A810680,"Do you want your child home school to adopt the four-day school week and extend the schools hours?

I do not agree with schools extending the schools hours nor adopting a four-day week.

Some students have just do not like what they are doing in class or do not get the chapter, so they get others students to do it for them.

They can get a lot of homework, so if they extend the school day they are going to have more homework than usual and be tired.

Students can get home late and cannot spend time with their families, if they have a lot of homework.

Within four-day school week students can get stressed out worst than usual.

The way that parent can react for adding more hours.

First, some people act like they do not know what they are doing, just because they are lazy.

In my opinion, some students like others students to do their work and that is not fair for the other student.

Allowing to extend the schools hours is going to mess people schedule or their parents work schedule.

Some parents get out of work early and they got time to pick their child up, if we extend the schools hours that could really mess them up.

Students are so much smarter if they focus on what they want.

I believe that once you put your mind to it, you will get it.

Next, parents do not like their child to get home so tired.

Some parents like to know how was their day or how their grades look like, but if a student is tired all the time how she or he suppose to have good grades?

Sleep is one of the most important things that a human being needs.

A human cannot go long without sleep.

Parents like to see their child happy, with energy, and doing things that she or he likes

If students do not have the sleep they need to have, that is going to mess with his or her grades.

School is hard itself and I do not think adding more hours is going to be helpful.

Finally, getting home late and stressing out are one of the worst things ever.

Stress can lead you to have some type of illness in the future.

What some people do to release stress is that they get a day to themselves and go to a spa or shopping.

Other people get things done first and they would like to shopping or to do something they like such as going to the movies, play video games, and play any sport.

Students get a lot of homework in a week, imagine in a four-day week.

People should really think first what they are going to do and get it done.

Some people just like taking everything as a joke and that is not good, but that is on them.

In my opinion just do it, just get it done and get it over with.

Some people just get lazy but they still get it done.

No matter what's on your way, you can always get things done.

When getting home late from school or any activity all you want to so is rest.

Some people go to sleep knowing that they have homework or a test the very next day, if they did not study or got their homework done, they might have a zero or both things.

That is why I think it is important to study and not to adopt the four-day school week.

In conclusion, conserving energy and resources has a lot of benefits, but I do not agree with adding hours to school.

Students have it so much harder now days that I think extending the school day is going to be even worst.

Some disadvantages are people get stress easily, they will have a lot of homework, and finally they can get home late especially if they have to stay after school.

Honestly people who agree on this have their good or bad reasons, but these are my reason why we should agree to extend the schools hours nor adopting the four-day school week.

However, just do what's have to be done for you to accomplish your dream.

If they add more hours to the school or not, do not worry just focus on you.",3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.5,6.0
046297CE5FF1,"A talent or a skill that I have is detecting peoples feelings. I think I have this type of talent because one time somebody looked sad and at first I ignored it, then after that they said that were about to cry. Another time was when I was snapping somebody and the person looked remotely sad so I snapped back saying "" Are you ok?"", after that the person went on and shared to me what she was feeling. I don't really know how this skill or talent really developed, but i'm very grateful and humble to sense and being able to know how other people are feeling and being able to help them. One "" theory"" or conclusion about how I developed this skill is how I was raised or maybe when I was growing up I lived in a friendly and positive environment around me that was just acquired to me later in my life.

Another example was when my friend looked really upset and sad. I told him if everything is ok and he explained to me about his personal life, about his mom and his dad. He was going through a great account of anger and aggression inside his core that he was building up, almost like a active bomb going off. And when the bomb exploded he released a rush of sadness and anger in him, punching the lockers, screaming at no one but his demons. It was just bad. I almost didn't know what to do besides trying to calm him down and try to make him feel safe. This went on for almost 20 minutes to 25 minutes at least!

But everything in the end turned out well, it always gets well. This was two months ago after that catastrophic breakdown. Now the kid is doing well, if not better than he ever was. I'm just very happy that I was there and helped him out, not like a friend, but as a human being.",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,7.0
7DDFF6DA8655,"What would make feel much better in class to work alone or in groups? Would it make you feel better and more productive? Some people think that working in groups helps them be more productive and helps them get the job done easier. There could be teachers who wouldnt support the idea of working in groups. If you're trying to convince your teacher you have to have examples to support your position.

Working in a group is more productive and easier it gets the job done quicker then you expect. You can assign each classmate your working with a job duty. One of each classmate can work in drawing, writing, searching up facts about the assignment and not least but last the leader to put everything together and help his classmates when needed. There can be minor things when working in groups. You could expect some who would do there job and just take advantage of time and not be productive. The leader is expected to get there classmates to work and not waste time.

When working alone instead of in groups there can be advantages. Like Having more time in the assignment and not rushing into it. You can have your own ideas without others forcing you to change it up into something they all like. When it comes to mistakes you can point them out yourself and correct them. Instead of stressing about who is not working and who can't get the job done you can work on your own. There could be problems too like not having enough time and can't get your job done as quick as you need it to be. There is other classes to worry about.

Some teachers wouldn't support the idea of working i groups. Instead they would like for you to work alone to get your job done easier. But not every student would support that idea of working alone. Some students could be left back and behind from class so they would need the help from his classmates. There is supporting ideas on why it would be so much better in groups and it would be to get the job done easier and faster. Being alone isn't very helpful when you need the help you do.

Working in groups would not just help students but teachers on grading your work. It can be stressful for them when it comes to working alone and having so much papers to grade. The idea of working with other students would be much more easier and productive. It would feel way better for you and other classmates.          ",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,8.0
FC5120C98AE7,"I think that all schools should offer video or online conferencing as well as online education form the school. Students should be able to be comfortable from where ever they are, and learn in a manner that they are comfortable with. There maybe different reasons where students may not come to school. However, if they do miss school students can have the abillity to turn in work and learn about what they missed. This would be good and better for teachers because students would have no excuse of them not turning in there work late or at all.

Students may miss school for all types of reasons, for exmple students can miss school for an urgent reason or a family situation. Some familys don't have enough resources to live off a good life, so, some students can't make it for school and have to work to support there families. In some cases familys have younger sibilings that they have to take care of, but the family can't afford to stay home and have to work. In that case families make students stay home to baby sit a little brother or sister. Students miss the education they need, and that's a good reason why they should have online based learning.

Having said that students may also be very sick and may not be able come to school. Students may also have variuse injuries that can be hard for them to move in certain areas, therefore they stay home and miss school. students could be in the hospital, and may not return to school for a long period of time, it could also be hard for them to transition back and catch up with his or her school work. Some students may be takeing care of a sick relative and my not be able to make it to school. online base learning would be very helpful to those students that are injured or sick.

Students also tend to leave the country, and go back to their countrys. Families make arrangements to visit their home countrys in the middle of the school year. in some cases families don't come back for long periods of time. Students tend to miss a lot of school work and education in the time they are gone. Online based learning would come in handy in this situation. Students could have fun where they are, and not miss a single assiegnment or a day they are learning something new.

Online based learning is the best solution to students missing school. It would be a great oppertunity for students to get back on track and finished what they started. I would recommend online based learning because I think of the families that are in deep need by the students that come to school in helping their families. I also think of the people that are sick, and that need rest at home. This program would help a lot of students get the education they need without worrying they won't get it.

We are determinant when we not stop doing what we really want. Stay doing the same thing every days that is waste time, because trying and trying and never learn anything is desperate. I agree with Thomas Jefferson that it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing, like get more experience in my job, persuade what I want,and improve my ability. If I practice or have a long time of being doing that will be common for me. With effort I can develop my abilities. To be convince convince what

I always get excite when I definity know what to do.

Another fact to get experience is persuade what I want. I may persevere in finish the high school,

so my family will see that at the end of make the things came the good news.

41D9F5D10332,"I believe that students accomplish more when they are always doing something. That serves more of a purpose than not doing anything at all. Students learn more when they are doing something productive. Students accomplish more when they take action. Another reason why students accomplish more when doing something is that they get farther in life than others. Lastly they get mature and learn what life is about. That why i choose that when a students get all those thing in place the student will accomplish more that someone that is not doing anything in life in their whole lifetime.

The reason I choose that we accomplish more when doing something is that we cant accomplish something when not moving doing nothing. My first reason why we accomplish more when when doing something is that when we do something we are learning. For example in the 4th grade i was really mad at math , so I took action and practiced everyday after school for the rest of the year. I would get good grade after i took action and studied every night. What I'm trying to say is that i wouldn't have accomplish that if i wouldn't have done something. Another example is that studies show that students that are always doing things at home or after school do accomplish more than students that don't do anything at all. Finally they learn how to mange their time more better.

Students that accomplish things get more farther in life than others. For example my aunt is a doctor and she put her mind in everything that she did. For example she took a lot of test to take and study for. So what did she do she always was multitasking. Another example is that a person that has made so many challenges in life is going to understand that you need too do something for it.

Finally the reason is that students when they are doing their work they are going to understand what it means to be a adult.,and to be more mature in life. Students get mature when they start work and going to school because they start to mange their time more wisely. Like for example a students is going to work right after school and they have a lot of work to do. They make that time do do their work some other time when they have time or at work on break. Another example is that if a students have a goo example in life they will get really intelligent .

Finally students that accomplish more are the students that are doing something in life other that just doing nothing. Students that are accomplish more are learning life skills. Students that accomplish more are going to get farther in life than others that aren't doing anything. Students that are accomplish more things are going to become mature. For knowing that they are doing thinks that are smart.",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,7.0
883C1EF358F6,"At some point in every ones life,There is a time to be self reliant.

People should make there own decisions, Because, As a self reliant person, making a decision based on someone else's advise can be very risky. For example, buying an insurance plan, going based in someone else's coverage will cover something you dont need, while if chosen based on your needs there wouldnt be a problem.

Self reliance is very important for person to become independent. If one dose not trust themselves how will they grow. for example, A famous quote by Micheal Jordan say's ""You miss 100% of the shots you dont take"". this quote eludes to the fact that as an individual it is important to have self confidence in their decision making, because if you dont take a risk in making your own decision you will 100% miss the shot's you take.

Furthermore Making o's own decisions are important ,because, People will not always be there, and you will be forced to make your own decisions. For example choosing your own apartment isnt anybodies else's job but yours. Choosing an apartment is very important and one must have self reliance in order to make the right decision for them selves.

In conclusion being self reliant is the most important skill you could have, while, I could see the other side saying that going to an expert is the best way to make a tough decision while that may be true, they will not always be there for you.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,7.0
6D6E937C3A67,"We do not choose our own character, if everyone gets to choose their own character nobody will have any bad people in this world, everyone would be full of good things because they will be able to pick their characteristics. If everyone had the same characteristics life would not be as good as it is now. Each person has different characteristics based on their culture, environment, childhood makes difference in their character. These are the three main reasons that differentiate people's characters, and makes them good in their own way.

Each person has had a different childhood which is an important part of people's characters. Childhood is very important because it is the the base of the building this is where person starts building their knowledge. Childhoods can effect kids when they grow up in a lot of different ways. A lot of teachers in the middle east hit their students when they do not do homework or get a bad grade on a test, this makes the students not wanting to go to school and hating school because they get hit in front of their friends, this does not give students enough confidence which is going to effect their characters in the future. Children who spend hours and hours on video game and making online friends, this make them anti-social people when they get older.

People's environment such as work place, friends has a lot of effects on their characters. If a person has a lot of bad friends that person's character is not gonna be the same as a person who hangs around with good friends, for example if a guy has friends who do drugs even if does not do them step by step they are going to get him to do it and that will start making changes in his character, on the other hand if a person has good friends who tell him let's go to the library to read or study that will have a positive effect on that person,s character. In work if a person is working and his manager yells at him that will lower his self confidence and have a negative impact on his character.

Culture has a big impact on a person's character in a lot of different ways. Culture is what is going on around the person and what he believes in or does not believe in. Sometimes cultures effect the person's character in good ways sometimes in bad ways. Culture makes people religious, pray and be good people. Sometimes culture does not give the person the freedom they need for example, in the middle east sex before marriage is not allowed which makes a lot of difference in peoples characters making them do secret stuff and not being able to communicate with the other gender because they are not even allowed to talk to each other because of culture.

In conclusion people do not get to choose their character. People's character is formed by a lot of different things such as environment, culture and childhood these are the most important to form a person's character. At the end of the day all characters are good in their own way, the difference between people is what makes them stand out and complete each other.

Playing basketball for the school is a good thing,for an example:Your getting sponsored,you get to participate in activities like drills,and you get to play against teams from other county schools. If you make it to the basketball team you have to be healthy because high school is different how you play from different other leagues and also you have to work out a'lot to get in a good shape so you can have a higher advantage on driving a lane or shooting a three on you opponents while playing basketball.

One important thing is that you gotta listen to your coach and have good sportsmanship because if you do,then you will have a perfect team to win the championship game because if you do good college coaches might scout and look for good players that knows how to handle the ball and play defense so they can prevent the other team from scoring. If you do really good on both of those things then you might have a good advantage that college coaches might pick you to be on the team.

My second favorite sport that i would choose would be football because in my personal opinion football is the best sport because you get to tackle people. If you participate in football for your school you have to go training because there will be defensive and offensive coaches that will be there to train so you can get on the team for high school football. In training,you would do dead lifts,hills,drills,weigh lifting,and scrimmages. You have to do those things because thats what coaches want to see,they want to see their players train hard because the players want to make the coaches know that they will work and train hard to make the team.

Finally, the best sport to choose would be football because it is a very aggressive sport and also the sport is very hard and you have to be a lucky person to make it to the NFL.This will be a very hard thing because you also have to do good school but if you dont the coaches might think about cutting you out of the team because they want your grades to be perfect. If you make it to college and you do good, you can be the luckiest people to be invited ti the NFL combine.

Students have difficulties and they affront them without their parents' help. Consequently many end up loosing their self in the worse way and they take paths that guides them into substances that had damage the rest of the society, like drugs or the alcohol. Furthermore, parents lets teachers decide what to do with their child because they think schools will teach them the right way to learn about how life works and that includes self-esteem. Although some people say praising student's deficient work helps build self-esteem because it bring hope for them, actually praising deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards because students will not improve their work and it is unfair for the hard working students.

According a survey found in Google, many students quite school at a young age because they disbelieve how good they are at schooling. Furthermore, the survey display a chart where a big number of those who quite schools are the greatest students and according to the writer they do not have enough knowledge about it. Praising them probably won't help them learn fast and smarter but it does not let them give up easily she wrote in a quote.

However, students that are praise for their deficient work never improve. For example Generic_Name, my friend's brother he quite schools since for years because he says that nothing he learns at school apply in personal life.

Even though his teachers did everything they could to help him improve his grades, additionally they praise his worst work and it did not even work. Moreover, The New York Times post an article about students failure and they conclude that students that have a job and study at the same time, they are more likely to finish high school. In the other hand students that gets money from their parents, most of the time they do not finish high school and if they the do, they do it with the lowest grades ever.

In addition, praising student's deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. According to the Generic_School, two of three students in a class graduate, but those who graduate are the ones that work hard and study for long hours to achieve their goals. Clearly, praising students deficient work shows that schools are becoming worst more than in the past years and students now are not competent to apply for a simple job. For that reason, many parents believe that deficient work lowers learning standards and that schools are getting worse and weaker every year.

In conclusion, self-esteem comes from the student's best effort, by working hard and not being unfair with the others. As we know Steve Job achieve his dreams by hard work and not by the praise of the society or even his parents. Because of his great achievements,

Apple is still one of the greatest companies ever created. Definitely, those kind of examples teach and stress the importance of building self-esteem by hard work.

And when you get home you could try to study at least a little bit. and the second one is you can stay after school with a tutor to help you in math,science,history, and reading as well.

And if you work as hard as you can then you may enter the college you like. And get some of the books you need for free because the college you want pay them for you. And if the college you want cost a lot of money it's fine because if you have a high GPA of 4.0 or 3.8 or if they see that your grades are high then they would make you pay half the amount it cost so you can enter. And the college would pay the other half of the amount of of money. So you dont have to worry about it. And they want students who study and work hard because if they got students who dont study and work there college would close down.

So if you work hard you can become what ever you want to be. You can become the president of the united states, a astronaut, a lawyer,

a judge,and a police officer these are some jobs you can get if you work hard. there are so many more jobs out there you can get if you work hard for. And those jobs need people who work hard and know what there doing. So they don't mess up and and make something really bad happen when they are there or gone. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,6.0
4BDFD3B3C521,"Seeking Multiple Opinions

Did you know that seeking multiple opinions can help you to make a better choice ?

It can help you to learn who you sould and should not trust to know who wants the better for you , who doesn't care about you , and to not trust everyone.

In 2006 a girl who mostly didn't know how united states school works needed to make a desicion of going to summer school or not she was failing the grade because she did not understand anything , she wasn't having a good time with social studies ,english,and math so she asked who she thought that were her friends when she got home she asked her family if she should go so she can pass the grade,her family said yes but her friends told her that summer school doesn't help to pass the grade it is just if you don't want to be all summer alone in your house her family told her that her friend were liying however she didn't want to believd in her family .After she took the desicion of trust her friends and not her family .She didn't go to summer school and she failed the grade because of all her grades were mostly in F and that she didn't want to accept to enter into summer school because of trusting her friends after she failed the grade because of her desicion the girl noticed that her friends didn't care about her beause they told her the worst advice for her to fail the grade ,they didn't want the girl to pass to the next grade . I f you trust someone who wants the better for you everything will end up good you will not have any problems, but if you trust someone who doesn't care about you and you don't ask anyone also not everything will end up good because they will give you their worst opinion because they don't want the better for you. People can learn to not to trust everyone because sometimes people might think that just because they are friends or they know them for a lot of time they are are giving them the better choice.

Another reason of why it is important is because you are not going to make a mistake of choose a wrong advice , end up wrong ,and to loose the opportunitie of which you were looking an opinion for.

In 1990 a very smart girl won a schoolarship in one of the best colleges of the county, but she didn't know what to do so she asked her friends about what she should do , when she asked her friends they told her that she shoud not accept it , the girl didn't know what to do because her friends told her that they were not going to go to that college, the girl listened to her friends and choose to not to accept it , when it was almost time to go to the college her parents told her that she wasn't going to go to a college because they didn't have the money to afford for one, the girl stayed at home without going to college and start the carrier that she wanted because of her choice .

That's why it is important to seek multiple opinion so you can make a better choice and to no to choose the only advice that you had in which everything ended up wrong and you will loose the oportunitie and maybe not have it again.

Finally it can help you to make a better choice so you know what's bettter ,not loose the opportunitie, and everything will end up well.

You can know what's better because you have a lot of advices and you can choose the best one, you are not going to loose the opportunite because you had a lot of advices and not just one in which you didn't have lots of opinions that could help you ,everything will end up well because people gave you all those advices to help you choose the better one.

In 2002 a 14 years old boy noticed that there was an opportunitie were a club theater wanted people who wanted to learn to act that boy liked theater so much that he wanted to enter into that club , but he didn't know if it was a good idea or not , so he asked his friends, parents , grandma , grandpa, and teacher about what they think aboit it .He had lots of opinions and he could chooce the one that he though it was better, he choose his family opinion which was that if he likes theater he should join that club and that's what he did he entered and everything ended up well he learned to act well and he started to appear in television wining a lot of money and now he became one of the most famous persons in the world and everyone ask if they can have his autopraph.

Seeking multiple opinion helped him to make a better choice and to not to loose that opportunitie that he had .

In conclusion seeking a lot of opinions have many ways to help you not to make a mistake just like in some of this cases people made not all of them didn't but the ones who didn't make a mistake were people who asked not just to one person they asked to a lot of people so they can choose the better choice . You can learn who to trust because sometimes we think that just because they are our friends they are going to give us the better choice when its not like that . When you need to make a desicion ask a lot of people so you don't make a mistake like loosing the oportunitie of which you were looking opinions for and maybe you are not going to have that opportunitie again.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0
E952F0EB5083,"Former British Prime Minister once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I disagree with this statement. In my own experiences I have never failed to succeed, I have always failed to fail. In 7-11th grade I have tried out for my school basketball team and never made the team. I have also experienced doing something on my first try and succeeding, Failure never brings success.

All through out my life i wanted to play basketball for my school. The only problem was every year I tried out i never made the team. This year I am a senior in high school and still havent played basketball for my school. I have realized that no matter how good I got it wasnt enough. Personally i can not relate with failing to succeed because it has not happened to me. I have never been able to fail and then succeed.

I can say from my own experiences. Somethings just come to you and your able to keep being good at it. While there are also things that are not able to do on the first try or ever. For instance my seventh grade year I was trying out for football. I had never played a game or ever tried out. First try and boom I am on the football team. I played left tackle and was a starter for ""A-team"". I had never played before and I was already starting. I didnt fail to succeed, I just succeeded.

As a result from the facts I have stated. I do not believe or agree in ""failing comes success"". Failing happens to everyone and I have yet to hear someone say "" I failed to succeed"". It is very uncommon for someone. If it has not happened to me in all of my seventeen soon to be eighteen years of life i dont believe it is possible. ",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,8.0

one way that can benefits you is to not make a mistake in future or even now. People who you learn form is older than you, and they know how life is behaving. For example if you make a mistake and also know experience of other you will understand how to fight to fix your mistake. They already went through life and know how the solution would be. My grandfather is old enough to teach me his experience, because he spend his life to make experience for his self and his children.

By learning experience it help you to advocate yourself. When you learn experience you can be a proponent for your family and also yourself. for example I was in 3rd grade and my grandfather said,"" Never give up in your life."" Always fight with your problem and your fear. If your are in a bad situation and you don't know to handle it your family also would be in danger because of you, but you know a experience of other you immediately can fight against your problem.

Another way that would be helpful is when you know a experience you can teach other people your experience. By doing this best idea you might help other people and make them happy.

ABB6A19842F1,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her instincts and ideas are on the right track. Its a good thing to value self-reliance but should people make thier own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? Majority of people say that you should follow your own instincts and ideas because it's your life. But those who are smart would agree with that but also seek guidance from experts and authorities to be better. Theres nothing wrong with having guidance , if anything your putting yourself in a better place. By having guidance from experts you can learn a lot things for example , you will make better decisions in life as you grow older , you would learn how to get things done the right way or better , you would be more responsible and mature.

By seeking guidance you will make better decisions in life as you grow older. For example, It can help you get a better job by knowing things you didn't know from experts. knowing specific information can help you understand jobs and career goals. Say you work as a cashier and a customer is yelling at you because they didnt have her favorite cereal and you understand that it isnt your fault and you kind of want to yell at her back because its your instinct to do so, but if you had guidance on how to react to people who yell at you , you would be calm about it and be respectful. a lot of people have lost their jobs for not reacting the right way to customers because their instincts were wrong. When reacting the right way and being respectful you can get promoted to a higher level or raise.

Guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters will show you how to get things done the right way. For example, your in a relationship and you're having an argument with your girlfriend or boyfriend and your instinct is to not lose the argument because thats how you were raised and told by your parents, but doing that will only make things worse and dangerous. Now if you had guidance from experts you would let the argument go and lose the argument because thats the best thing to do. You and your girlfriend or boyfriend should sit down and talk about it to fix the situation. 65% of relationships are vilolent because of many arguemnts and if people knew how to get things done the right way the percentage would drop a lot.

Seeking guidance from experts will allow you to be more responsible and mature about a lot of things. For example , you buy a house and your wife or husband moves in with you. But every Friday you want to go out with your friends and have fun. You spend a lot of money every Friday night but you know bills are coming up but you still decide to waste money because you're having a great time and it's fun. Then the bills come and you and your partner can't afford it and then that starts arguments. You start borrowing money from friends or family, but you cant pay them back and it just makes you look bad. Few months pass by and you get evicted from your house and you also get really bad credit and your just in the worse situation ever. But if you had guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters you wouldn't be in that situation because you would be responsible and pay everything on time and not spend so much moeny. You also wouldn't care about what your friends say abouit not going out every friday night because you're mature.

In conclusion, people would just live a better life by seeking guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters. you would be more responsible and mature, you will make better decisions in life as you grow older and also, get things done the right way. People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas are on the right track.

7DBE22D9F0DA,"Should your School have Extending Hours in a Day ?

Your School should have long hours because student will have four-day week out of school ;Therefor, students will get to relax and fished there work and it is a great way to stay away from stress. Seen some business have adopted a four-day work week ,with each-day consisting of ten hours, your school should do so too. The benefits This will have on your school is ; students will have more time to work in class and understand what the teacher is teaching . Also you will have more time to fish your homework over the four - week day . Long school hours are good for the students because they will remember more of the stuff they teach.

Students are told they have and sol and the students are stress because they don't know how to study for it and do there homework at the same time . Also students are worried there grads are going to get messed up. Also whenever the teachers is teaching there going miss out on it .When there are sol student meant fail it .

school should add more hours.

Student are in class and hours are passing by and some student are slow at learning but the teachers are rushing them to give what they have and the teachers dropped there grades down because they didn't fished in the time that was given, therefor, schools should give classes more time needed to fish there work.

Students that are tired dont have enough sleep because of all the homework and the jobs some students have to do in only two week ends and its not enough hours for the students to sleep, therefor,

they need a lot of sleep to stay awake during school days. School should have a four-day week off.

School is a hard place to keep up with . student are sometime stress about school and how much they need to catch up in subject .This is why taking a day off or add extend hour to a school day is import.",3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,6.0
545E9BF477C1,"the reason i think that we should not have more school time is because some people in school would not be able to keep up with other kids. and most kids get ttired of being in school for six hours imagine being in school for longer then that and even more kids would start going to sleep in school. because they are already tired of all the classes during the day.

with another good reason that i disagree with adding more time in school is because some people have to do things after school like take care of family or go somewhere important and if you added more time then they would not be able to do get this stuff done because they would be stuck in school learning longer then the time they are accually supposed to get out.

i belaive that there should not add more time to school because it would also be a waste of time because teachers would have to do even more stuff done buy more stuff for students and get more work done grade more papers because we would have a longer school time and then the teachers would have to write more speak more and do stuff more then they would if we had only six hours in a day.

with another reason that i dont thing school should not be longer is that it would not only affect the students and the teachers but it would affect everyone because then the whole school board would have to do more work and the school would loose a lot of money because the school board would have to buy more stuff for students and get more things that kids would need to get everything set up good for the students.

with another good reason we should not have longer school cause if we had longer time kids would not be able to handle so much because they would be learning so many thing in one day and then it would confuse them and when they are going to take a test they would be confused because they were pressured to learn so much in a short period of time and they would not like that because they might fail.

44911FE6867D,"As a middle school student, I will tell elementary students to not do drugs,juul, or drink alcohol. The reason I'm telling them to not do this is because their lungs are going to get ruined,and they will not be able to breath good and they might need an oxygen tank. Also if they do it over and over again they will get addicted and probably they're going to do it for their whole life. Another reason to not do it is because if they might give it to one of their friends or tell them to try it and they might get addicted to it.

My second lesson to tell is to not get in trouble specially when you're about to get six broken pillars because the you're going to have to go to a meeting with your parents and all your teachers or sometimes just you and your teachers. Also if you do get the six broken pillars then you are going to have lunch detetention and not hang out with your friends at lunch and you will probably want to hang out with your friends and not just stay there and stay quiet for the whole lunch. Another rason you don't want to go is BIP why? you ask well BIP is a room where you go if you did something bad.

Third is don't do dumb stuff like get in trouble for running in the hallways,play fighting,or talking back to a teacher. All of the things I said are the dumbest reason to get in trouble for specially when you're on a rush to get to class or lunch. Other reasons to get in trouble is being tardy and if you're tardy you will get a broken pillar unless you have a note from a teacher or an excuse.

Fourth reason is to get involved in school activitys like basketball,track,soccer,volleyball,or whatever you play. It is good because it helps yoiur muscles be strong help you stay strong. Also try to keep your grades up and not bring them down because then you're not going to be able to participate in events specially in important events. One of the reason to not get in trouble is because if you do you'll probably get kicked out of the team.

In conclusion is better to not get in trouble because your parents might get mad and won't let you participate. Also try or get better grades so you can succeed in life like other people or one of your family members. You can also get a better job or get a better house,car. You can even have a better lifestyle. ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,7.0

296B1DD1E251,"Do yo have a good impression? I am agree, the first impressions are almost impossible to change, because I feel that the first impression is important for everyone. There are many people that do not show how really are, and try that everyone love them, but at the end they show how really are and everybody move away. The first impression said everything about us. I believe that, If you show them everything about you, the people will love you how you are and they will trust on you.

Always we need to be honest with you and with the people. My ideology is be honest with yourself and do not show something that you do not are, If you want that everyone show you how really are.

I always show how I am friendly, lovely, funny, charismatic with everyone, and also try to help when someone need me with my knowledge and capacity. One of my experience is in my work, every single day new employees go to work in the store and I always help them to know how the store need to look like, and also with the customers I always smile, because I show my first impression with them, and I feel great when the customers saw me with a smile and they said: Hi, how are you today, it is good to see you and have a good one. I have few months working in the store, and I feel comfortable with everyone, because the customers do not know you enough, but they trust on you and they tell you something about his life, and with the rest of the employees we pass fun, We are like a family and we help us ourselves.

In the school is a little bit the different, because in the school I am shy, I do not talk with anyone just with my best friends, but I always show my emotions, enclose with the new people in the school, but sometimes they pretend be good at the first time, but with the pass of the time they have different attitude. That happen to me around 2 years ago with different person, the first person I knew her in 9 grade, when the both was new in the school, We became friends and everything we did together, but She change with the pass of the years, in summer another friend and his sister told us what she talk about me and my sister, but I always be honest with her and friendly and she showed me something different than the first time. Then, with another girl was a little bit the same, because she had jealous for my sister and I to had good grades and be active in the school the last year, but she always had bad grades, and We tried to help her but she never wanted, then with my sister and I move away from her because she was friendly with us but she was a bad friend with us.

I feel that we need to show always how We are not matter what everyone thing about us. Sometimes is good a new change in our lives, but never changing you essence. Something that I always do is think about my weakness and how can change it to a positive way

Finally, I think that We can be success in the life, the first impression will open many opportunities in the world, I know that the good person are these that show a good attitude when you know it the first time, and something in your heart told you that you knew a good person. Everyone will have present that they can trust in you and they will feel great to know a person like you. The first impression is always a good one. Many people do not know me and they think that I am conceited just how I look like and they do no take the time to talk with me or just smile me. My point of view is each person need to empathize with everyone know more people try to make new friend but always show like we are.         ",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0
E2456BDC6648,"Conserving energy and resources by attending less days to school. Adopting a four-day school week and only adding two more hours; each day consisting of nine hours. It will help to reduce the consuming of energy and resources. As we go out everyday to complete our duties in the school's building, we consume energy from the sky lights and others useful lights, the computers, and laptops. Also the food students receive in school as a lunch. Plus students frequently purchase gas to come to school; due that some students need to come in their own cars or public buses, because they don't live around the school area. Additionally students that are currently having a part-time job will be able to work more. In the case of student who are not working in a part-time job would get one more day added to the weekend, and they would be able to spend more time doing family activities or having a good time with friends, and close people.

To start with, reducing the consume of energy will help with our planet; energy is produced with some elements and one of them and a very important one is: water. The less energy we use or waist the less will be the affect for our planet. Adopting the four-days school week will make all of us stay at home on Fridays and reduce the energy use from the school when using lights, computers and laptop that need to be charged.

Secondly, If students come to school only for four days, the food that they usually obtain on Fridays will be saved and use for the next Monday; that way saving food will start to be a good benefit for conserving resources. Also some students come to this school but they living in a different city not closely to school; they purchases gas every week and they have to spend money, Therefore if they only come for four days a week; they will saved gas for the weekends or for the next week of school. That's one of the best ways to conserve cars' energy and resources; due to that gas use petroleum to be produced and other substances and chemicals that come from our planet soil grounds or others areas.

Lastly, Students will obtain benefit by adopting this for-days school week as well, because the students that are currently working in a part-time job will obtain the opportunity to work a full day on Fridays, they will be able to increase their revenue. In the case for students that don't have a job, they will have extra time to do homework, projects, and family activities as well.

Even thought, they are students with a different point of view, when it comes to adopting a four-day school week. they argue that adding two more hours to the regular school day, will be more exhausted and they will have less hours to work in their part-time jobs.

Additionally, after school homework clubs are useful because students can socialize. Students can learn how to talk better to other students.

65170E28799D,"Does someone or something form our character traits or do we choose them ourselves? John Lubbock wrote ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" Characteristic traits are important because they make a person who they are. That can not be chosen by anyone but they can be formed. Reasons they are formed and not chosen are DNA, the fact that people are not perfect, and research. One very good reason why people might say that characteristic traits are chosen is technology.

Humans are not perfect they make mistakes and their is nothing wrong with that. If humans choose what they wanted themselves to be, there would be no mistakes and no problems. Problems happen for a reason and that is to learn form them. People get mad, sad, angry and thats how life is. If we choose our traits we would all look the same we would all have that best genes and would not be fun.

Another reason why we don't choose traits ourselves is because of DNA. DNA is what gives a person their hair and eye color and a lot more things. Humans pass down their genes to the next generation and keeps going. Something give use those genes to pass down from generation to generation. Scientist have studied and learned that character traits are passed down and not chosen.

Another reason is research. For many years scientist have studied that there is no way for a person to choose to have green eyes when their parents both have brown. And if there was a way it would be really expensive many people would probably not be able to afford. We wouldn't be able to choose our own character traits in a women's belly it's not possible. Fetus can not control what they want to look like or sound like that is all up to DNA.

Now there might be ways to choose what a kid might look like and that is with tecnology. Though it might be realy expencive that is a way but traits you can't choose. Theres not much say in what traits someone wished to have or has. People can't choose character traits. The only explonation is that there is something or someone that forms them for use to have.

Many students might change schools because they want to be in a team. sport's teach diciplean and team work witch will help in their future live when they grow up. when they get a jod were they have to do team work it won't be so hard because they already now how to communicate and show team work.

C968149003DE,"So many people at my middle school want to start a after school homework club and this because studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start a homework club. Well I think this idea is not going to work because student will think that they will only have to do homework at the homework club therefor when there no after school most kids won't turn in there homework. Also another problem is the volunteer work no kid wants to stay after school to help and if there only teacher I am certain that kids would lose focus. And the subject I

don't think that 45 minute Are enough to learn 4 main class plus the homework that's not enough time to finish homework and learn.

And many people just want to go to this homework club just to finish fast I think that people that really need it should be in this group not just cause they want to finish fast they can do that at home and after school wasting time and the teachers time. This one of the main problems I have with the homework club is that if kids go there they are only go to fool around with there friends. And not let other kids learn and do there homework and learn being a middle school er my self I have seen how most kids with there friends u would think that they are mauter but not as much. But many people say maybe if you let them they will change but so many people have goin't chances but they keep doing the same thing.

As a conclusion I think that this after school program has no use because homework is called homework for a reason and if u do at school they would not do at home when there's no after school so this after school program will not work for many reason like no a enough time not enough focus distractions. And people who just want ot play and not do work and volunteering kids dont want to stay extra and kids won't pay anttion to the teacher. ",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,6.0
B0AA5045D915,"I agree that school will follow the model by extending that school day two hours to conserve energy and resources.

I think that the school must extend the school day two hours, people can have more time to do homework , more time to practice, if school extend two hours than some people will finish their homework because as everyone know some people have to work and its more difficult for them, people who have to work and pay bills.

For example if school extend two hours than the students will have time to conserve energy and also some students will enjoy that time to do the home work or stay after school with the teacher for help.

On my position if school extending two hours I will enjoy the time to practice at school because I know that i may work hard to get a good grade in the school.

4D60247D96CE,"Dear Principal,

Community Service takes time needed away from Students.

Students may need to go home and help out, at Home.

So they can't really help out at school, for Community Service. Students need time at home to do homework, and learn in class. Example, like if they Come to School the next day, and they Didn't do their Homework, b/c of Community service it's not their fault, that their not

Doing their homework or that they don't understand how to do the homework without learning in class. Its actually taking lots of time away from their learning, and work time. Students may have a relative, in the hospital they need to watch, or pick up their little brother or sister from school, or just babysit while your mom or a relative needs you to watch their kids.

So principal I'm asking you Do Not make all the students in the school Do Community service. Try making slips for the Students who want to do Community service like for afterschool or something.

200671752EE0,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something? Yes we accomplish more if were always doing something but only if what we're doing benefits us. Why? Because if we're always doing something then we would succeed more in life, we would always be active and doing something productive. But it also depends on what kind of activities your doing and if what your doing is going to benefit you later on in the future. Because if what your doing isn't benefiting your future then there's no point of doing something that doesn't help you out for later on in life.

For example sports, if your always doing sports then that would be great way to benefit your future and also a good way to stay active. The reason I say this is because by playing sports you could have many different opportunities. Like getting scholarships into different universities, especially if you're great at playing the sport. And also it's another way to help you stay fit because your always doing some type of exercise in any kind of sport. So that brings me to my next example.

Another example is exercising, if you like exercising, going to the gym and just being active in general then that's another great thing to do that'll help you accomplish and benefit your future. Why I say this is because by being active it's going to help you to always stay fit and healthy. And how that benefits you in the future is because whenever you get older you won't have that many health problems or issues with your body so you'll always stay fit. What'll also help out a lot is by always eating healthy so that's something else you could do to help you accomplish and benefit your future.

Also working is something you could always do that'll help you accomplish more in life. Why I say this is because if your always working then that means you'll always have money. And having money would help you out in a lot of things. For example, it could help you out in school, for a car, food, clothes, and etc. Or you could also save up money for whenever you might need it for an emergency. It'll also benefit you by always having something to do so that way you won't just be home doing anything.

So in conclusion, doing something is always going to help us accomplish more in life. I don't believe inactivity serves a purpose because you won't accomplish anything if your not doing something that benefits you. You always have to be active and doing something productive if not you won't be successful in life. That is why I say that you have to do something that benefits you so you could succeed in the future. So yes, we accomplish more if we are always doing something.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,9.0
C31019435CBC,"Winston Churchill said that, ""success conssists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with Winston Churchill, because if you fail once and give up you'll never get what you want, you'll never success. People nowadays just give up and don't accomplish their dreams because once they failed they are afraid that they're gonna fail again. But if you keep trying and trying to get where you want to be, you have to believe in yourself, nothing is easy in this world, if you want something you need to fight for it even if you keep failing, you can't give up easily.

If you dream that you want to be someone in life, that you want to be successful and have a good future, you have to sit and think what are the things that required to accomplish your dreams. You have to search and investigate the possible ways you can become what you want to be. If for some reason or another your plans didn't go as you expected you have to try again but in another way. You have to believe that you are capable of doing what you want and accomplishing your goal. I know a lot of people that lost their enthusiasm just because they couldn't make it the first time, they didn't want to look at their own mistakes and what did they wrong which was the reason they couldn't accomplish their goal. But instead of keep trying they just gave up and moved on with their lives but at the end they're doing something else that they never imagined they'd be doing because they didn't dream of that.

Many people that never give up always success in life because it doesn't matter the struggle they go through they just keep going. For example, my sister went to take her drivinig test, the first time she went she didn't pass it. She was mad because she studied the whole week and still didn't pass it, so she kept on studying and went the next week and she passed it, she was really happy because the first time she went it was hard but she kept on studying until she passed, she didn't give up. Sometime all you need to not give up is motivation because if you motivation yourself or if someone else motivates you, there's a possibility that you're going to success. Every time I motivate myself or someone else does I feel like I have potential of doing what i want to do or be. I just have to believe in myself that I can accomplish my dreams and I don't lose my enthusiasm.

In my opinon, I believe that when we fail for some reason in life it's a lesson that we have to learn. When something goes wrong in life we can't just give just for the simple reason that we fail but that doesn't mean life is over, that means that we have to keep trying and not do the same mistake that made you fail the first time. I know that life is a struggle but that does mean you can just give up because your first time was not successful at all. This country gives us so many opportunities to be successful just for the fact that you have work hard to get what you want. We have so many options of what to do with our lives as teenagers, we have the ability to choose if you want to success or be a failure for the rest of your life, if you want to give up or keep going. No matter the struggle never give up, there is always another way of being successful in life. Life is like a game, you play it like you want to, but you have to decided if you want to be the winner or the loser, you have to find the way to be successful and win without giving up. if you lose, you have to try again and again until you become the winner. When you have a goal in life, you have to find the way to accomplish your goal to success and not to fail because you believe in yourself that you are capable of doing it, you see that you have potential of making that goal.

In conclusion, never giving up even if you've failed a lot of times will make you successful because if you keep trying and trying to accomplish your goal, you'll eventually accomplish it because you will try many ways and sooner or later, you'll success in life. If you have failed once there's a possibility that the next time you try you won't fail because you have to go back and look at the mistakes you did wrong that made you fail the fisrt, and not do them again so you can success and not fail again. People that never give up are most likely to success than people that give up on the first try.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,7.0

A long time ago Thomas Jefferson, was are president in the

United States of America.

Thomas Jefferson was famous for a lot of things, but people say that he was famous about his writing because his writing had a lot of meaning to it.

This is one of the thing that Thomas Jefferson wrote,""determine never to be idle ... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Thomas Jefferson is tying to say here is that, ""if we don't do something in life we can't succeed in life."" Some people think, if they don't do nothing to keep their grades up they will never accomplish something, so they try their best to study harder so they can keep their grades up by studying everyday.

If people don't do nothing they will never succeed on something like if some student don't study when the day of the SOL

come they will not succeed on the SOL. That why some people agree with Thomas Jefferson, that we accomplish more if we are always doing something.

If by doing something in life we can accomplish a lot of thing but if some people don't give up easily. For example, if people are not succeeding in school they can't play any sports or any clubs. There for, if the people work really hard everyday they can accomplish something. Some student schools have a rule that say if they don't have any good grads they can't be able to join any clubs and sports if they can't do nothing about their grade. The student will never accomplish nothing if they don't do nothing. Some people know accomplish something is going to be hard all the way but if they don't do nothing about it they will never succeed, can't bring their grads up some people will not be able to play any sports or clubs in their school anymore. If they are not doing nothing, it will never take them know where to accomplish like, if they are in a sport and in a clud and they have three F, if they don't do nothing about it they are not going to play any more so that why some people have to study everyday so they can be on the team or in a club. To make them to sussed is that they need to do something and ask for help so they can accomplish something. some people say ""By not giving up they can always study everyday so they can accomplish something and they can sussed all the way by doing something"".

Some people can succeed by always doing something that will help them in life. For example, some student try their best to keep their grade up in their classes so they can graduate from high school. There for, the student need to study everyday so they can graduate from high school. Some student say that by studying everyday for each class will help them get their grads up by passing all their test and quizzes, that will help them a lot to graduate from high school if they study really hard everyday. If they study everyday they can accomplish something in their school that will make them graduate so they can't feel that they are far behind form their classes. If people succeed by always finding a way to study they can accomplish something.

While some people believe that we can accomplish more things if we are always doing something, other say that they don't believe that is true. Other people believe that they don't have to study everyday they to accomplish something but they need to do something so they can accomplish something. For example, other people can study twice a weekend and they always have good grads and some say that is enough of study so they can succeed to graduate from high school. Although that mite be true, some people are really slow and fare behind in school some people need to find a way to always study and to never give up and keep on studying everyday so they can accomplish something by always finding a way to study everyday.

Thomas Jefferson quote has inspired me and maybe other people too. Some people have succeeded on a lot of thing just because they have been studying hared everyday and some trend really harder too. They are trying there best to never give up because they say by doing something we can accomplish more if we are always doing something. To do so they can succeed on their things in school so they can graduate from school. If people can succeed they can accomplish something by never giving up and always find a way to do something so you can accomplish something.

0E24F8C90CFB,"Some students may think that taking classes online is the best thing for them. Meanwhile, the other half of students think going to school suits them the most. I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because it would be easier for them to stay focused, give themselves as much time as possible, and get to know what the best and correct choice is for them.

Majority of the time kids struggle focusing in a class full of friends and strangers, which causes them to lose focus in the assignments they're given and start having conversations with other classmates. Some know that they're the type of person that can't keep their mind in one certain place, so their minds wonder off into a whole different planet. Meanwhile the other half of students know that they're capable of staying focused no matter what the situation is. Doing work online though, prevents all of that from happening. It gives students time to think about what exactly it is that they're doing and need to get done, and prevent any mistakes from happening on a certain task or assignment. Staying focusing is very important, if students stay focused then they'll get things done in time or even done before the actual due date or time, and not have to worry about doing it later on.

Giving them enough time as possible to get tasks done is important. Most teachers will give you a certain time limit to get things done, which of course will cause them to get it done in the certain amount of time they were given so that they get it all done as quick as possible. Online on the other hand, can also have certain due dates and times that you have to turn work in but you're more relaxed and calm about things because you have more time in your hand and can think things more in depth, instead of just having to think of things right out of the top of their heads. Doing things on their own time and paste is best for any student, they can find it easier to concentrate and don't have to think oh no I still haven't finished this, or it's almost time to hand it in but i'm barely done with the first section.

As students spend more time alone, they sometimes tend to think about what's best for them as an individual. Some might say that, they work better independently, because they know they aren't able to handle being around other students 24/7, losing their ability to focus, or just hate being around people in general because they know what others are capable of. Whereas, other students may think the opposite and feel like they can work being around other people no matter what type of situation they're in. Just working alone can get them to really go in some deep thinking about what's the best descision for them and know what's going to be the best choice in the future or even in the present.

In conclusion, I think attending classes from home has plenty of benefits, like giving students more time to think, having a lot more time to focus, and getting to know whats best for them. Just imagine being in a class full of 100 students everyday, all talking at the same exact time and yelling across the classroom trying to get friends attention, what would you do?

For an example, One of your best friend you met in 2nd grade has moved across the world but your mom said you or her can visit each other. Not seeing your best friend for years is actually hard to be honest but you can still keep a good attitude because you have the chance to see her. Also failing a test is so scary because your parents might get mad at you but you can also still fix it. You can tell your teacher and tell them if you can take a retake and they will obviously say yes. By any chance you can past the test.

09ADB0629CD0,"Benefits of attending public schools

Imagine a child or student taking classes at home. How would his or her parents feel?

Would home school be helpful for their child? Is homeschooling important for thier child than public schools? Students would benefit to attend classes in school rather than attending class at home because students can become active, getting enough information, and having the ability to share ideas.

Attending public schools can persuade students to become active. Teachers can also persuade students to become active as well. Teachers wants students to have fun. For an example, physical education, or for short PE. It is a program in school for children to have exercise and training. Teachers would allow students to play inside or outside. Even if students do not want to participate.

Not only schools let students become active in class, but also offers information to students who need help. Getting information can help students to become better at understanding things that students learned in school. It is important to know why students want to learn. For an example, students staying after school for help. Staying after school can help students study for a test. If a student needs help or needs more information, do not be afraid to ask for help. A teacher will be there to help you. Teachers can give their best to answer student's questions.

Not only schools can persuade students to become active and offers information to students, but also shares ideas. Sharing ideas can help students as well. Students can share their ideas other students. For an example, completing assignments in a group. Students love being with partners or group to solve problems. Students would listen to others student's opinion or debate and see if they agree or disagree. It is always helpful to be with a group and not be alone by yourself.

In public schools, students can become active, can get information that they need, and let students share their ideas. That is why it is important for children to go to school. Home schools are different than public schools. Home schools can be very challenging for some students. A student working alone with no partner, not being active, and not getting enough information from parents. Imagine a student being in that position. How would she or he feel? Public schools would be the best option for children. Imagine if every student went to school, their would be a positive change in their future.

Example 2, a wrestling class, a class or sport is when two people wrestle it out and whoever taps out loses, can make you stronger faster and better at making up strategies that can influence on what you wanna do when your grown up, therefore will help you grow and move on in life.

Example 3, a recycle class, a class where you pick up trash in parks,sidewalks,your school can help you by making you feel good to do very generous things,plus your helping out the planet making you wanna do more good deeds,and lead down a good road,therefore will help you grow and move on in life.

Why students should participate is because you are taking a healthy risk and can benefit you in many ways depending on all of the activities like soccer can help with entertainment and boredom and like volleyball can help with strateging and self asteem, common theme in all of these is having to learn from them and find solutions to problems and can help you find new interest later in life, that is why i agree with the principle.

There are many different schools that can let you take online classes. There students going through family issues at home that they aren't able to attend school regularly. It can help them to learn in class so they don't fall behind or fail the grade. They just want to learn like us and have a great future.

When having the benefit to take online class at home is working at your own pace. You are working at your own pace to get in done fast or you just like to take your time.

It can also help them be more then the other colleagues at school. When having this opportunity your able to get work done without any distractions.

think online classes are much beneficial then regular class.

For example, a smart student sometimes isn't able to finish his work because they would be talking to other students during class. There is no other student just you and the teachers so you won't have any distraction. There is no distraction in their room if their alone.

Online classes are known to be small. There for its good as the student would have a one on one conversation with the teacher. If the student does't understand something, and needs help the teacher being able to give more time and attention to the student. When you finish with the class your done you won't have to wait for anybody else. Basally online classes are school but independent just you and the teacher.

The disadvantage are not completing the course ,because most students get distraction watching or reading other things online not related to school. Also not completing assignment or the course thinking its not school because your not going to school. You also won't be able to interact with other student.

Finally, It could ruin your reputation. A lot of people care about their reputation a lot. To the point that it could be emotionally wrecking

First, no one is perfect. We aren't perfect beings, we all have different personalities. Different things we do that others don't and some people may think its weird or we are weird to do that. That's when first impressions come to play. Meeting someone for the first time can often be hard to manage since is the first time you are meeting this person. Truly anything could go very wrong. They could think they way you talk, eat, and act is weird because you are trying way to hard for it to not go bad and sometimes that comes out as bad. Life sometimes will go wrong and we can't change that or let it get the best of us because we aren't perfect and it's okay if sometimes things don't go our way of liking. if it goes bad we should be able to change it or try again.

Second, it should't defined who you are. Every human is not alike in any way possible, all of us are unique in our own way. Sometimes we make mistakes and theres cases where people don't like that. When you are on a stated of mind of anger, you could do something drastic but that doesn't defined who you are on your heart and mind. You have your own mistakes and flaws but that isn't you is just a part of you that doesn't think and does thing on impulse. When you are trying to make everything perfect that person it could stress you out really bad and anything could make you go off. when it's the first time meeting that person it can really tress you out bad but that's okay. First impressions should be able to be change because if that were to happen it could really damage a person if that certain person was important to them. You should be able to reschedule the date when everything is better and you can be normal. If they are truly your friend they will allow to you to that.

Finally, it could ruin your reputation. Let's say you are the most friendly person in your school and everyone likes you because of how fun or nice you are. you would love to keep that way. But one day a new student comes to your school and you introduce yourself but right out of the bat they don't like you without knowing anything about you. That thought could eat you up for the rest of the time, and you try and try to get that person to like you but they don't. Being able to change that first impression is all that you would like to do but it feels impossible. But it isn't impossible if that person wanted to get to know you they could but they don't want to and yes there's people like that all over the world. Having a second chance could change everything for you but we should't let it get the best of us that person will come around at their own time. We can't make people be our friend if they don't want to. If they want to get to know you they will.

Conclusion, First impressions are not important things will go wrong sometimes and that's okay. We can always try again another day, it should't get the best of us or makes us feel some type of way if that person truly wants to be your friend they will not care about the mistakes you make or anything around that. You are human and you make mistakes sometimes. And that's okay, it doesn't defined who you are;only you know who you are on the inside. First impressions should't even be a thing they stress you out and makes you over think. Being able to change the impossible is something we should be able to do always. Don't let anything like that make you think less of you. ",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,8.0
A1976FDEA9E2,"If I would pick a enjoyable activity it would be art. I

would picked art because you can do anything you want with it. The reason I

picked art was because a long time ago I would be sad or mad. So I went to the consular and she told me

I can use art. And how will

I use it? I would color what i felt and i would take my anger out its like telling someone what you feel except your drawing it.

My secound reason is its not always about drawing you can also the other things with it. You can gather resources and you can build things with that. For example if you had feather and bottles or cans you build a bird out of it. And even just painting something like a wall with difrernt kinds of color thats art.

Also it can be soothing because when you have a lot of tress you can paint. Because whe you paint and your trying to paint the beach it relaxing. For meits relaxing because whe you start to paint the brush won't be hard like a pencil it will just go by so soft you won't have to worry about messing up.

It's also great becauseyou get to learn about artist. Because it will kinda help you. Because it can tell you about how they draw or paint they can have a special way doing it. Like I read artist that used dots to paint and draw I thought that was enterested so i tryed it was kinda of hard. But I enjoyed trying it. This is why i like art becuase you can use it for anything. what is your favourte thing to do?       ",2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,5.0

861B68E29325,"Many people agree, two reasons why people agree one reason why people agree is because if people thinking positive they can always do the right thing. The second reason why people agree is when people thinking positive good things happen in life. Two reasons why people disagree, first reason why people disagree is because when they thinking positive something bad happens. Second reason is when people think positive they never get what they looking for. For example many people were waiting for the new fortnite season to come they were all thinking positive the season suppose to come on July 13 2019 it was July 12 many people were happy waiting for the new season to come next day the day the people were waiting for the new fortnite season it didn't come out it took more then 5 days to come out so people start thinking negative they stop thinking positive about fortnite people were mad they quit the game people hate the game so much because the delay of the new season. Another example my grandpa always telling me about his past he talk to his past to us to me and my cousins my grandpa is a good person he is always worrying about other people life he is one of those good people who like to help others he is not a selfish person. The past he always talk to us about is how he was when he was a little kid he work hard for his parents he had to things to do school, work for his parents to help in the house he didn't have the much of time to do his homework for school but he was always having a positive attitude because he knew the he could do better in life now he is a nice person he did better because he was always having a good attitude he didn't disrespect people or a family member never. Now he is living his best life he have 2 daughters and 3 sons they help him so much now they working hard for him they not rich but they have good stuff because they work hard just like he did to his parents.

People should have positive attitude in life because if they do good things gonna come for them in life. Good things happens to those who wait, the reason why good thing happens to those who wait is because they always having a positive attitude like the prompt said is the key to success in life. Many people disagree because they always thinking negative in the past they were all having a positive attitude but the may got a lesson they probably were waiting for better thing for life but they never wait the much they just gave up now they disagree they don't think the same because they got a lesson for having a positive attitude they just gave up easily. People never get what they want they always having the bad feeling the they wouldn't never get what they want maybe they have been through a lot their life was probably not the best but people should always wait even if you don't get what you want you just have to wait maybe life doesn't give you what you want for something better they just have to wait for it they need to have a positive attitude not a negative attitude. For example people have been thought a lot they lose their parents they have to live by their self is hard for them but they just keep going with life they know they can do better then many others they just keep a positive attitude. How ever, life is hard but you just have to keep going never give up having a positive attitude always hope people to keep going in life they just have to wait for it.

when you came to this country and you are alone and dont have help from other people you just cant be positive you dont understand the language and if you are illegal you dont have the many benefit like if you are born here in the united stated you have to hide from the police sometime you can not find a good job because your situation.

2. when you lost someone important in your family and you cant go to se then because you were in other country etc. you can not be positive for this reason i said what i positive attitude is not good of all.

3. if you are from other country some people discriminate you may be they think is easy to be here they dont think about the danger than you have to pass to be here they discriminate you by your skin color and becouse they think you came to this country just to make money and then came back to your country but sometimes you came to suscive and make a knew lefe but many people dont understand that and they trate you so bad and who can have a positive attitude by this reason.

4. yeah! is right there are many thinks to be positive, like your family,frirnds,girfriend have a good jod, graduate from high school is other reason to ve happy and positive but sometime you just can be positive.

some time when you feel bad and you have a bad economic situation youcant caund whit your friendsbecouse they tell you that tney can help you becouse they dont have the resources but some of then are lyan and if you know it you fell like their are playing whit you and that is not a reason to be positive.

253B2D521F14,"Do you think starting a career at a young age is good? Many students think that starting a career at a young age is good, but its is not a good thing for them or in general. Students often choose to start it at an early age because they could be really excited about it. I think that them focusing on their studies until they get older is even more better, and it would be a great thing to do. And instead of the young students hanging out with their friends at somewhere thats unrelated to their career or studies, they should maybe go to a tutoring center or help each other. Students should also have time to think about and choose a career that they think they would focus on really well. If students start a career at a young age, it can have quite many consequences. Usually doing so would make them more likely to have failure in their career, lack of some education, and they won't get much respect from people.

One of the reasons why I think that students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age is because they will more likely to have failure in their career. If they have failure in their career, there will be many problems. One of the problems that could happen is that they could get sued if if they end up doing something wrong. Another thing that could happen is that they could get many complaints about things. And if people complain about them and if they make bad reviews about them, it will make their image look bad. And for that they might not be making a lot of money out of their profit, because people know what failures they are.

Another reason why I think that students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age is because they will lack some education.

If they lack some education, they won't be able to know a lot about their career. Its just like a chicken is running to get to the other side of the road with his head cut off. One thing they will also have trouble in is interviews. They will not be going to get success if they don't know much. And if they don't know anything about their career, that person could get fired. One of the things that they would also be doing is making a lot of mistakes. The students should stay much longer in school to get proper knowledge of that career so that they will earn success.

Another reason that students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age is because they won't get respect as much as a well educated person that knows all their studies and who knows a lot about their career, if they do so. People would probably ask them that why didn't they take their studies further. Also, and what they could've done before to fix this situation is that they could've gotten help from others such as their friends, teachers, by staying after school for extra help, or asking their parents to hire a tutor. Additionally, or what they could do instead of getting extra help, is that they could just focus in their career class and not slack off. They should also do a career that they're interested in. Because a lot of the times when they see that one of their friends chose this one career, then they will do the same one. That's why young students should always think and choose very wisely when it comes to picking career.

Young students should focus more on their studies and shouldn't commit to a career at a young age. They should all focus, and they should keep studying until they get much older, rather than choosing a career at a young age. It is also a very important to not have failures and mistakes in your career, so that your career turns out to be good. I think that young students should always study, and never lack any sort of education. Also, and that they should get the most of education to gain much more of peoples respect. By doing all of these things as a young student, they will achieve great success. By them not doing these things, they won't get much of their career success.",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,7.0

When someone gets something good you want the same for you. But if its something you don't like you can still see what they did and learn from it. It's important to learn experiences from others because you can use it in your own life and you can spred the word to other people so they can do the same thing.

Use experiences from others in your own life. For example, if someone has done something in their life that you might think will happen to you listen to what they are saying. You can learn from what they tell you.

Another way is your parents can help you by telling you their experience. sometimes you might have to ask your friends for their experience. It might work it might not, people learn things different ways. Listen to the people you look foward to, to tell you. They will help you get through something because they might know they're an expiration to you.

Help other people by spreding the word. In addition, When someone tells youabout someting that another person experienced you want to listen. The reason is because you csn learn from it and iclude other people. this means when you hear about an experience someone went through remember it so that you don't do the same thing. You might even want for it to happen if it's a good thing. spreding things about what you or other people experienced can help so many people without you realizing it.

It's important to learn from peoples experience because you can use it in your own life and you tell tell other people about it. The importance of learning from peoples experience is to help yourself and others. People go through different things so all things don't always end the same way.

DC25CFE5EACC,"Would you rather wake up early every day just to go to school and feel grumpy every morning? Or would you attend school at your house? The 2nd option sounds better right? But,is it really that nice? Going school is more than learning about old people fighting,numbers,reading,and writing essays. Its about making friends and connecting with teachers and be more responsible. Also one importent thing about school is that its free. Online classes are expencive,hard to get used to,and impossible to work at home. This is why attending online school wont be worth it.

First of all,.online classes can go up to 150 to 200 dollars. So, some students cant afford the classes. If you want to get online classes, you must get a job and work for weeks just to pay for online classes. When you can just go to school for free. Also if you do get a job it will affect your work at school and it will affect your job. So. is it worth it?

Secend of all, students can not focus when they are at home. Cant work on your homework because your little brother is crying nonstop? Just imagine doing an online class for 90 minutes at home. Also, home is a place to rest,have free time,and spend time with family and friends. Home is not a place for school.

Lastly,online classes can be hard to get used to. You have been in a class room this hole time in school. Now you have to get used to something new. Change can be hard on students. But,now they are all by themself in there house learning how to get through this online class. Where theres no one to help you but you. I am taking an online class in my last year of high school. Its hard. Its really hard. You wont understand what to do and what not to do. Because there is nobody showing me how to do it. Its just a 3 minutes video and now i have to wright a 3 page essay. And not knowing what kind an essay to wright. Sometimes there are no videos to help you.

Some people say that online classes are better then regular school. Well they are worng. Heres why,school can help you get your commnicaion skills up and help you grow as a person. Teachers at school can help you to get through the class. In online class you dont know if you are doing something right or worng. There is no one to giude you but yourself. It is not better then regular school when you think about it. Online classes you are so limited you dont understand. At school you will have some many more opitions for you.

410D72D3CCE8,"Great people had discovered great things for us and if it was it because of them, our community wouldn't be the same. It has been said that to be yourself in a world that constantly try to make you someone else is the greatest thing yourself can do and accomplish. Personal thoughts and opinions agree with this statement and proof to be real with articles and autobiography of examples from successful people.

First one of the reasons of being yourself is better than being controlled is to think in about someone who has already accomplish something. An example can be: Nicolas Tesla, Martin Lutherking, Neil Armstrong, and Albert Einstein. They all have done a something that changed everything, not only their life but everyone's life. Being controlled by the government to go to school and do what they want will not help in life goals; to be successful the community have to achieve their goals to make a change.

Furthermore being yourself will help in self confidence and will help in life accomplishments. For example, big man with an opportunity to work with a company much superior than his, has to go to a conference to talk about bussines, his self confidence isn't really well supported and he ruined the conference because of it. All successful people have something in common and its having self confidence. It will help you in real world challenges, and being what a person is everyday is the best thing to do.

In the other hand, the community keep its way having trouble to live and following the government's ""help"". Only people with great disciplinary actions can success with this help and its why people keep following what they say to do. In Virginia there are a lot of public schools, they all teach the same thing and have the same exams. This is the same school 10 years ago and people have goals that cannot be accomplished because of school limitations.

In conclusion, Reading at all the people who has accomplished something for them and for us the key to be successful is that community have to change its way to accomplish goals and to not only depend on schools that will not teach us how to life after school is finish. Depending on government is not the way to be successful. Self confindese will make successful people as well as goals.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,6.0
49BABF3BEF2F,"In some schools around the world, students are expected to know what career that they want specialize in before heading into high school. Schools also have specific classes that will guide students into the direction of career they want to be a part of when they graduate from high school. Here are some positive and negative reasons i have for both sides for this prompt.

Some students in the US have the option of either coming into high school knowing on what they want to specialize in when older, or knowing at a later stage what they want to become. In my honest opinion I do not think students should be committed to an occupation at a young age, not only will this frustrate them when the graduation time comes and they are not ready, but this means that they will not have any room for any other plans and that can cause a lot of problems for the student. Trust me this has happened to me but I've managed to pass through with dedication and time.

Students shouldn't be thinking that they have to have a career on their mind as soon as they walk into high school, this is not how it should work. this is why. Some students can fall to inconsistent behavior which means that if the student says one thing that he wants to become and then later on the student chooses another path when graduation comes than he didnt live to meet his goal when coming to high school, many students fall a victim to this including me but this isnt that bad of an issue it can be easily resolved. In conclusion to this reason, all students should ALWAYS have a back up plan no matter what the case is.

Maybe in some cases having to have a career in mind might change a lot. Maybe a student might want to be a plumber and they know strongly for a fact they want to become a plumber, all they have to do is inform their consular about their life goal into becoming a plumber and to ask about the plumber class. If the school does indeed have a class for this student he will be taught many valuable lessons and he will use it when he joins the plumbing work force. Second reason this would help is when the student joins the selected work force that he/she would join, they would have prior knowledge that would help them maybe financially but maybe could help spread some knowledge to other employees that are not to confident in their job.

In conclusion, many students can benefit from having prior knowledge on what they want to become when entering high school, and many students can benefit from thinking about their goal later in life. But the one option that i found beneficial to high school students was the option that students should not have to have a set career in the mind because; this will stress them in the long run, they will not think of a back up plan, trust me the backup plan is one of the most crucial things you could have in high school, and last but not least, students can have a hard time dealing with the reality that the career they have chosen might not become what they once thought but just a memory of failure.

EBF9131A638F,"Distance learning is a new learning method for students to attend classes from home by online or you can video conference. Schools have brought distance learning in their system for students can do their assignments from home. Many people think this is a great idea and some oppose to this learning method. The schools can see if they are on track or online to their classes but if they arn't in the online class they will be behind in their assignments. Is this new learning method a great way to learn? or does being in a class with a teacher more beneficial for the student?

The main problem in distance learning is if students are really getting on the online class. Students who do get on are on task and on point. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosen't feel like doing it. Students who don't do their assignments they wait until they are at school because in school you arn't distracted like at home you are concentrated and ready to work. Is distance learning beneficial for students at home? for some students it might be but for many it isn't.

Is online learning at home beneficial for students? some students do think its beneficial and a really great idea. Many people prefer learning in class with a teacher because they can ask questions if they don't get the question that is being asked. Students do some of their work but get off in a short period of time if they are at home, if they were at school the students would be on task and doing their assignments, unlike at home they would be off task. Many students prefer teachers teaching them so they can get more information of what they are being taught. Distance learning isn't capable of doing what you do in a classroom. Is distance learning really beneficial?

Is being taught in a classroom more beneficial for students? many students prefer being taught by a teacher than online. Students are more productive and they share their thoughts and explanations in that specific assignment than online classroom. All the students are in the same page and all gathering more information by writing notes and being concentrated in their tasks. Students are more interactive with each other and sharing thoughts and many techniques to get the answers by fellow classmates, also getting good grades. Classroom learning is beneficial for many students and teachers.

Students have their own way of learning, it doesn't matter if its distance learning nor in a classroom. It is how they feel how they enjoy learning. Students will say this is the best way for learning other no this is, it doesn't matter what you think is the best way to learn its how you enjoy learning something it is the best way for you. The students who prefer distance learning really do it at home and feel like they are learning mush more at than in a classroom. Students who enjoy learning in a classroom like being around peers and want knowledge from everyone around them. They are both beneficial for that specific student.

E12450BAE343,"Would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by student getting to much school work that cannot all be handied in on night. Every day kids complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Students being educated at school gaing more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Learning at home and not at schools helps kids succeeed and have better grades.

One of the best thing about homeschooling is that it can be done at anytime, and anywhere. Children have a flexible time schedule which means that the parents can help. The students can work around the parents schedule instead of the parents working around the student's schedule. Some students have a trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pase set by teachers. Homeschooling allows students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Another thing about homerschooling is that there are no misguided rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules. The students can focus on their studies.

When you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit students. Learning from home won't have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment their are not familiar with, which makes the feel uncomfortable. If a students learns from home they will feel more relaxed and confortable and won't stress about work. In a school, you are struck at desk for 6 hours and have a limited time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. This is not help a student's learning at all. On the other hand. If you are at home you can eat and do whatever you want when you want.

There are still a few reasons not to do distanced learning. There are many more opportunities with public schools. People from different colleges don't go to students'homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public school are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school funding for public schooling willl fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of buged cuts. In public schools, depending an the teachers, cheating is hard to do.

My conclusion is students should be offered classes online or at home because the environment is less distracting, which could be less stressful. At home there are less distractions, rather than at school where there are many different thing to students, can greatly affect the quality of a student's work.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,7.0

57B782277D2F,"Think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone and what do you feel is more beneficial? I think that working with a group is more beneficial because you can get things done quicker, share creative ideas, and it shows teamwork. It also saves up time when working in a group and when having deadlines.

First, working with a group gets things done quicker and you don't have to worry about much things when working with a group. When you have a group, they could be doing something else while you do another thing at the same time. However, having to do all that stuff by yourself slows you down and might not have time to finish. Your group and you are all doing something and that makes everything go quicker because your not doing it all by yourself. If you work alone you could be stressed and have to think of all the ideas. Working in a group can really bring more ideas to the stuff you and your group are working on. Also, you can divide the work with your group members and make things faster.

Second, sharing the ideas with your group can be helpful. It can also be very fun working with other people and having different opinions around. Someone in your group can be the most creative person and really help out on what you are working on. If you don't share your ideas then whats the point of being in the group. Everyone needs to have something to say and something to work on. If you work alone you will miss the opportunity to have someone helping you and have an opinion on it because when you present it, other people might something to say about it. Working alone can be frustrating and exhausting for some people because when they don't know something on one will be there to help them. Also, having to work alone might make you to multitask a lot and difficult for you to finish on what you are doing.

Last, shows teamwork and that teamwork makes everything better than having to work alone. When you show teamwork with your group it shows that all of you can be leaders in that group. Working in a group can be really fun because you be partnered up and meet new people or be with the same people you know and make the work effort exciting. When being in a group, you can your part while everyone else does theirs and it makes everything go quicker.

In conclusion, I would prefer working with a group than working alone because working with a group make things much easier and less work too. I wouldn't want to work alone because I wouldnt have anyone to discuss and share my opinions with. Having to do all that work by yourself can be very difficult in the process; things may not come out the way it should. Also, when you work alone you might not have many ideas to think of and with a group you can. Working by yourself may not be as much fun as in a group. If you had a group you would be able to divide the work, but working on something by yourself probably make it two times harder. That's why I think that working in a group is more beneficial than working all alone.",4.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,8.0

72635AF44FA7,"Some schools use cellphones in the classrooms for educational purposes. Allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom may have a positive effect in the education of the students, who use their cellphones frequently. In other words, it will make students feel better about doing their classwork. Because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and students will learn better.

One positive effect of allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom is that students will have a chance to finish their classwork or homework. Some students have classes that left many homework, so that means that they may need more time to finish their assignments. Moreover some students have personal issues, for example; Sometimes I can not focus in do my homework because I may have a problem that blind my mind and that makes me feel stressful, and that does not let me work on it. Also some students have jobs after school, for example. I have a job after school and sometimes my tiredness is huge that it does not let me finish my homework, and I can tell that it is really difficult, so having this experience I think that it would be really good that school allow students use their cellphones in the classrooms to educational purposes.

Another reason is that students will have the chance to check their grades or assignments. Some students miss school and they probably does not if have assignments, or they does not have time to check it in home. Most of the students forget easily that they have homework, for example; Sometimes when I get home and I started doing some of my labors and when I notified it is already time to sleep, so they next day I do not have any time to finish it. Therefor it will be good to most of the students check what they are missing during class, and they can probably ask the teacher for permission if they can work on what they are missing. Also ask for help to the teacher if they does not know how to do it, for example; I had a friend that math is hard for him, so he check his assignments in the classroom and ask the teacher for help to understand better, so I think it will help students to get their grades better.

Some people say that the allow of using cellphones can cause a negative effect is because it will distract students, for example; some teachers say that students will be doing something else, like texting or playing video games, in other words students will not pay attention in class. Whatever they are incorrect because students will a better way to learn, in which one they will feel comfortable. The point is make feel that they can learn in an interesting way, for example; Some teachers let students play trivia games on their cellphones, so students can learn and have a good time doing it. They will learn better because most of the things that students look in their phones they are capable to memorize it. May be the pass generations think that the use of too much technology, like allow the use of cellphones in the classrooms is a bad idea because it will make our brains slow is not true it just help us to learn in a better way.

In conclusion, the school allowing the use of cellphones in the classroom will have a positive effect because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and they will learn better. We are the new generation and the future of the next one, we have the help of technology to get a better knowledge. The future is on our hands and make it easy is our decision. They are just finding better ways for us to learn and educate better because they want us to succeed in school, like in our lives. ",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,7.0
C671BB7889B4,"Do you think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career in a young age.'' Some people believe, it is good idea for students to start knowing what their career is so that they could get a head start. Other people believe,

it is not a good idea because they could change their mind in the future. I think choosing a specific career at a young will get student's prepared for collage, won't have to stress when they're older and so that they have an idea on what to do.

First , being committed to a specific career at a young will get student's prepared for collage. For example, Once student's arrive at collage, they wouldn't have that much trouble knowing what to do because they have already taken a similar course during their high school years. Of course if a student doesn't know what they are doing then that will a huge struggle for them in collage. Another reason why it is important for student's to choose a career right away so that they know what's coming for them and won't freak out as much.

Second, student's won't have to change their minds too much,because they already know what they need to do since they already prepared for it when they were younger. When student's get older they won''t have to have to worry about not liking they're career because they enjoyed so much when they were little then, they will have to like when they are adults. People seem to worry about their future way too much because they have no idea what to do and that doesn't seem to good for them . Therefore, you will always need to have an idea or at least a backup plan, so that it could help them out more instead of doing nothing.

Third, The student's who choose their career at younger age will have a chance to be more professional in the future and have more accomplishments, In other words, let's say that you want to be a singer, then you will have to start taking some singing lessons in order to complete your goal . Sometimes in high school, they will offer you some performing arts classes. Mainly some people would take it so that they could be better before heading into collage. All though, Collage is a lot different than high school but you will still be prepared for it either way with the the help with your teachers.

In some other cases, people disagree with being committed to a specific career at a young age because student's could change their mind. The child's parents' may want their teen to do a specific career that they want their child to do, but he or she won't like what they are doing so that will lead a huge impact . Overall, Some people forget that changing their plans is not so bad after all because they could take break for a year and figure out what they'd like to do not what their parents want them to be. That will be a good example on why to be committed to your career at young age , so then you know what is best for you .

Being committed to a specific career at a young age will be a better way for student's so that they could have an idea on what to do. So please teacher and parents if you want your child to have a better goal and future then let them choose their own career not to late and start early!!!!     ",3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0

.To conserve energy and resources, my school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours. because everyone get tired or estreced, do not make enought money to buy resources, and dont have enougt time to be with the family.

The beneficts to conserve energy is to sleep the eight hours. so you can conserve the energy and don't be extreced about be more time in school. In contrast if you do not sleep well you feel like you will felt sleep. so is better less hours of school because eveyone will conserve enegy and the less hours of school can bemore better because everyone would be consentrated and learn more.

Is hard to be in school and have a job after school. because both of them are important for our life. but must people what need is money. so must people prefer to work and make money than have more hours of school. for this reason many people prefer to have money because can buy any resources or enyting that they need.

for example. If I am working and also going to school and the school day extend for two hours. I feel very extreced, so many peolple cuit school. And prefer to work.

There are also some disadvantages because if they extend the school day two hours is not inought time to be togeteher with the family.

Imagine, each person have different impressions like when they know bad things that is happens in their life or great things that makes them to have a fantastic impressions. I am disagree with this statement because it is probable that each impression that we have is based about the things that other peoples do. Probably you can have many impression about something that you believes that is terrible but you can investigate about it and get a conclusion that is not why do you think so your impression can change, it's not impossible that the impression can change.

First, it is possible that we can change ours impressions when we see something that it is good or sometimes that it is bad. Sometimes we think that all the things that we see are reals but we never understand what it happening in real life. Also the first impression that we have about other person it is not great because we don't know how is the person or what they want so we said bad things about them, we need to know the person first and share many things with them, later we can justify them. Sometimes the bad impressions are not good, because some peoples have problems with their health and when they know something that is so bad they have depression or other things that makes them be very sad or they don't want to do anything.

In life we have many impression that are incredible, when we have a opportunity to get a great job, we have the best impression when we are in there, we see how is the place, the things that other peoples do, we can share with other persons and it is great, but we can change with the time because the impression that you had in the beginning it is not going the same, maybe now you have problems with your friends in the work and the impression that you have about them it is not the same. It is easy that we can change the impression that we have about the things or the person that you consider your friend.

In the beginning of the year I had a friend and I had the best affection about her, In my opinion she was the best friend that i had but with the time she changed, she was bad with me, she did many bad things about me, so my impression was other, I don't know if other peoples think the same because my impressions changed fast when i see things that i don't like it. In the same time i was thing that she was not a good friend ""why she changed with me"", i was sad because the person that a considered my friend and now is a simple person.

89857315A1A4,"How to distribute forty work hours a week most usefully? Nowadays, a four-day work week is very rare, because this system is new; people always being careful when something new come out, but then they understand it is better. The four-day schedule is more balanced, energy and money saving and variable. This is why, I believe, our school should should follow the new schedule.

First, the forty-day school week is more well-distributed, because the students would have more time for rest, doing homework; so their ability to study will have been raised. On another hand, ten hours in school might be exhausting for the pupils, but the school administration may make breaks longer and more frequent to solve the problem of tired students

Second, the four-day schedule lowers the use of energy and resources. The school would use less electricity to heat and cool the building; it will spent less money for servicing the students and investigate saved money to science researches, equipment and study program development.

Third, with the sour-day schedule the pupils become more free: they might share more time with their family and friends; spent more time for their hobbies and working. The students may hardly learn if they are late for making project or plan the interesting and fun weekend in the three days; the bad thing about rest four days: you will not rest. School days will be very busy, hard; but maybe more educational and efficient. Long ten hours in school might be uncomfortable for the students, who do extra curriculum activities like preparing courses, art clubs and sports. However, our school has all comfortabilities to do extra curriculum activities inside the school's building, so the students do not need to go anywhere else.

To conclude, the four-day school week seems experimental for people yet; but when something new is thought the people realize an idea is innovative, then the idea becomes an action, which becomes regular.   ",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,7.0

Although student get to proud and tend to over do the work, giving the student praise always comes out to be better than what they actually expected to achieve. Giving students praise always makes students feel good. Praising students who fail always has a different outcome the second time they do the task been giving.

Giving the students praise always comes out to be better than what they were expecting;for example,a student who was doing bad before you praised them realized what the purpose of the work was and put all their effort into the work. Therefore, the work being produced was very productive.

Praising a student builds their self esteem by making them feel good about the work that has been done. Which means if they feel very good and proud of the work thats been done the work that will be produce will be very creative and outstanding.

Praising students who produce deficient work encourages them to produce better the next time work is been given to them. Therefore,the student knows that someone is always there to encourage them when needed.

In conclusion,praising students always tend to make them do better. In that case if the students feels good their work will be better.         ",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,6.0
B7C150A40F86,"It is known, that students truly enjoy the most they can any break of the year. Giving a break to students in the evening and all summer, is better for their process of graduation. That is why, students must do the traditional four years of high school before graduating.

First of all, since students have so much schoolwork and homework to study, they often need a break, so that way they can relax in their home and do other activities with their family that are not related to school. Summer is a season in which students need to go out in vacations and spend time with their family as well. Generally, not every students and their families get to spend so much time all together in the evenings, that is because of their routine. Most parents have from their jobs summer break, and they prefer enjoying it together with their children. It would be unfair for them to have to not enjoy that much their summer with their children just because the students have courses during the summer.

Another reason of why students must do the traditional four years of high school before graduating, is because after they graduate, they are more prepared for the career they decide doing. It would not be a recommendable period of time having three years of high school for students that still need to keep studying and preparing themselves for the career that they are going to study in college. The students can get more experience while they are reaching to their goal which is their graduation.

In high school, every student should have at least an idea of what they are going to be dedicating themselves for the rest of their lives, and most of them suffer by not knowing what career to choose. Some students may say that they would really wish graduating as soon as possible, but the fact is, that by being in a hurry of getting out of high school with a diploma, they would make the mistake by maybe choosing the wrong career in college for themselves, or even maybe deciding to not go to college just because they did not have the enough time of high school to think and decide the options that colleges offer. Giving students more time for this particular decision is a good way to let them know what they are capable of doing in their future.

In conclusion, students having four years of high school includes many benefits that can help them to be more prepared for college, rest more in summer, and giving them a better process of high school for their future in college and job. Students can challenge themselves by experiencing the traditional four years of high school and see the advantages of the result that they reached which will be very beneficial for them.

As long as the kids are not failing teacher has the job it is very key that students and teachers should be having good relationship. If the student ever needs help he or she can feel comfortable talking to the teacher and the teacher should be helping the students. If they need it because they can loose their job.

Lets say if the students decide to design the project there own. The only problem with that its going to be to easy for them. Also it wont challenge them so there brain will not learn anything and it will be useless. If it was a group project most of the kids would go with the smart people so they can finish it. And not worry about it and some of the lazy kids will cheat on the projects. If i was the parents i would tell them do it yourself and learn how to finish the project the right way and get a good grade.

Having the teacher design the project is way smarter. They will know what kind of project to create. And also if this was a group project it will be smart for the teacher to put some kids in the group because then the teacher can decide how many points it can be. And how long they have to finish plus the students dont do anything in there break myself being a student i can relate to that. But they have to learn something so when they do start school they will be one step of ahead of everyone. My personal opinion is that i probably wont do the assignment during break right away but i will finish before it ends whenever i have the time.

At the end of the day both teachers and students are trying to help each other out. And i think its more productive the teacher designs the project because when the teacher grades them or goes over them teacher can give feedback. Thats very important see what parts you did wrong or where you did good at. Having feedback can help you a lot but staying with the teacher to design the project is the best idea. Because the students can learn more and get more information on there project.

Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students love the idea of taking their courses at home, will have more time to do any activities they could not do in school day time, and its more easier.

First, students love the idea of taking classes at home because students do not have to wake up early for school, that give students more time to sleep and all of us know how important to get your daily hour sleep on our brains. Also, it's good for students who are shy for what ever reasons. I know someone who took classes at home for third and fourth quarters, so he didn't have to go to school. The classes he took started at six PM every Monday and Wednesday. This guy told me that online classes were helpful for him and made him pass.

Second, students will have more time to do any activities. Schools started at eight AM and ends at three PM. At this time, students could do any thing like working in the morning time or help parents in anything or do anything else. Students could use this seven hours to do anything that may help them in the future. As I said before, online classes start at six PM and ends at eight PM.

She have a sickness problem, Have her on nurse at, and only go out when the nurse is taking her somewhere or if her family going somewhere.

Firstly, She have a sickness, the reason is she is a very sick person, she can't be around people if so the person will have the sickness she have. The sickness Generic_Name have is not just a sick problem it's really danger for other people around her, even her on sister can't really be close to her, so she won't get the sickness from Generic_Name.

So she had to stay home when the sick come so she can control it, and don't have to get embarrass around people when the sickness hit hard on her. Generic_Name had the sickness trouble before she start staying home, because she didn't think the sick was really serious by the time she was almost done in 12th grade years, and than it become so serious for her were she couldn't control it anymore. The school and her families decide to let her take her college classes online instate of going to school everyday while she is very sick, she just stay home now take everything she needed in order for her to finish college now.

Next, Her on nurse at home, the reason is that the kind of sickness she have is require to have a nurse with her, so when she need help the nurse will be right next to her to help with some of the things needs from the nurse. The nurse is there to helps her get better, feel good, and to hill her from the sickness she have now. Generic_Name nurse is a kind person, she even help her with homework she takes online, because she use to be a teacher before she was a nurse care. Nurse Generic_Name is a great nurse for Generic_Name families like her the way she is with Generic_Name as a nurse person at home. Generic_Name had nurse Generic_Name since two years ago , while she was sick at home, every time she's going through a hard time the nurse always make her feel better.

Ms. Generic_Name get pay a lot because she work harder than she needed to be work as a nurse, and she tires Generic_Name very will and help her with every step of the way or if she going through something as teenage who is growing up from a sickness problem she help her go through it, and gives her good advice about how life is . As a nurse Ms. Generic_Name spend more time taking care of Generic_Name health than her on families.

Lastly, Only go out when the nurse is taking her somewhere, or if the families going somewhere together, the reason is the sickness she have make her don't go out very often. Generic_Name only goes out when it's something important to her, while the family is going to together, or if the nurse taking her to some places. For example, she can go out with nurse ms. Generic_Name is she's going to get a check up in the hospital with her. Sometime the family decide to go in a trip or visit somewhere when there's break from school, she can choice to go or stay home because don't want to get out of the house much. It's a hard decision for her to get out of the house, because she is very sick and going through a lot of pain as a teen.

The also make her feel special and never make her feel left out of the family, because she is a nice girl to be around, Generic_Name don't get in trouble not even a bit. So her family is praying for to get better and to a good shape again cause they miss how she was before she got sick.

Finally, I think students should benefit from being able to attend to classes from home, because it's a good way for someone who is very sick or going through something. Taking class online is a great reason, but it's also not a good reason, so if someone need to take it online than they should let that person do it. If it is important to them the school should let it happened for that person to take class online. People don't want to come to school a sickness while they in class no not at all, so it's a good idea and a good opinion for that student to take classes online and at home if you are giving order from your the school, the student should be able to take it.",2.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,5.0
